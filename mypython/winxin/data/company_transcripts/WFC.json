My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo fourth quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session [Operator Instructions].", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our President and CEO, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our Web site at wellsfargo.com.", "I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site.", "I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tim Sloan.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you Jim. Good morning and Happy New Year. Thank you all for joining us today, I know it\u2019s been a very busy morning for most of you. Our results in 2016 demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with loan and deposit balances at an all-time high while we maintained a strong risk discipline. Last few months of the year certainly were challenging, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the hard work and progress of our team -- that our team made to rebuild trust which I'll highlight shortly. But first I want to summarize our financial performance for the past year. We generated earning of $21.9 billion and EPS of $3.99 a share. We grew revenue by 3% including 5% growth in net interest income. Average loans grew $64.5 billion, up 7% and average deposits increased $56.5 billion, up 5%.", "Wealth and investment management total client assets reached a record high of $1.7 trillion, up 7%. Our credit results continued to be strong with net charge off rate of 37 basis points. We returned $12.5 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases and we reduced our common shares outstanding by 76 million shares.", "On Page 3 we describe the progress we\u2019ve made on our retail banking sales practices remediation plan, including contacting our retail and small business customers and encouraging anyone who has concerns to contact us. We established a sales practice consent order program office reporting directly to our Chief Risk Officer which is undertaking actions to meet the requirements of the consent orders that were issued as part of the settlements in September.", "As part of this effort we submitted a Reimbursement and Redress Plan to the OCC and the CFPB in December. We refunded a total of $3.2 million to customers including the 2.6 million that was part of our original analysis. As part of the consent orders work is now under way to expand the time periods of our review to cover the beginning of 2011 and the period through September 2016 and we've hired an independent consultant to evaluate sales practices. We've also gone beyond the requirements of the sales prices consent orders as part of our effort to make things right for our customers including a nationwide mediation program at no cost to our customers.", "In addition we've begun the data analysis to review 2009 and 2010 for potentially unauthorized accounts and we've engaged a separate third party consultant to evaluate sales practices more broadly across Wells Fargo. We are leaving no stone unturned so that we can emerge from this a better stronger company.", "We've also made progress on evaluating potentially unauthorized credit card accounts including any impact to customers' credit scores and analysis of credit signatures to verify authorization. We want to identify anyone who was negatively impacted so we can make things right. We've accomplished a lot over the past few months but we still have a lot of work to do and we understand that it'll take continued effort and time to rebuild trust with our customers, team members and other key stakeholders.", "Another important action we've taken is the recent launch of our new retail banking compensation program, this has been a top priority over the past few months and it is a significant step in reinforcing to our retail banking team members what is expected of them, how their actions connect to our business priority of serving our customers and how they'll be rewarded for performance against these expectations.", "There are five key principles to the new plan which we highlighted on Page 4. First, there are no product sales goals which we previously ended in October. Second, we will gauge success based on customer service, increases in primary customers, household relationship growth and risk management, and not on opening new accounts. Third, this new plan includes a strong focus on team performance with metrics heavily weighted toward team and branch goals, not just individual goals. Fourth, we have stronger controls in place to monitor behavior and ensure we're doing things the right way, including more proactive monitoring at the regional and corporate levels. And finally, we will be closely monitoring results for any unintended outcomes or behaviors prompted by the new plan and we will make changes as needed.", "It will take time to communicate the plan and train 1,000s of team members so they understand the changes they need to make to successfully achieve new objectives. We're also leveraging a number of new business success metrics including primary customer growth, which measures the growth of customers that use Wells Fargo as their primary financial institution, and household relationship balanced growth to measure how Wells Fargo satisfy the broad financial needs of our customers. We will share more details on these and other metrics during our Investor Day in May.", "The incentive plan rollout is an important step in restoring trust, this new program coupled with our work in redefining our service experience and training our leaders and frontline team members will be important elements as we continue this work. Also effective this week is part of our annual compensation review process, we increased our minimum hourly pay rate to a range of $13.50 to $17 an hour, a 12% increase from the previously minimum rate and 86% higher than national minimum wage. We believe this increase is a right thing to do for our team members.", "On Slide 5, we provide the December customer activity in retail banking which we\u2019ve been updating on a monthly basis since our last earnings call. In general, while account openings are still down from a year ago, customers continue to actively use their accounts and many of the trends have shown improvements from the lows earlier in the fourth quarter. Let me highlight a few of those trends in more detail.", "Customers are increasingly coming into our branches including a modest increase in banker interactions which started in the last two weeks of November and continued through year-end. Customers continue to open more checking accounts than they closed and primary consumer checking customers increased 3%. Our credit card business benefitted from strong holiday spending and December had record monthly purchase volume growing 8% from December of 2015 and active accounts were up 7%.", "While new application stabilized in October, we have not seen an increase in application volume. The decline in December compared with November reflected normal seasonality. We have recently started to reintroduce some outbound calling and direct mail and we will be monitoring these results very closely. Customer experience scores continue to improve from the lows experienced early in October, with branch customer experience scores nearing pre-settlement levels by the end of December.", "While customer loyalty scores have steadily improved since the lows in October, we still have work to do in order to return to previous highs. The improvement in these scores reflects the outstanding jobs that our retail banking team has done by focusing on providing exceptional customer experience.", "Our existing customers have continued to use their accounts and we\u2019ve seen higher deposit and credit card balances and increased credit and debit card transaction volume which drives near-term revenue. The decline in the rate of new account openings may impact the pace of future revenue growth, so we\u2019ll continue to be transparent regarding those trends.", "In addition, we\u2019re also tracking the impact to our other businesses, while businesses that are not reliant on retail banker referrals have not been significantly impacted, lower banker referrals continue to affect businesses such as mortgage. Referrals accounted for approximately 9% of mortgage originations in 2016 and we expect lower referrals in the fourth quarter will reduce funding volumes in the first quarter by approximately 2.5%.", "In summary, we are pleased that the trends have stabilized and many metrics have started to show improvements. Before turning the call over to John Shrewsberry to discuss the details of our financial results, I want to update you on our resolution plan. We\u2019re working closely with this Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC to better understand their concerns, so that we can bring our resolution planning process in line with their expectations.", "Additionally, to demonstrate our commitment to the remediation of the deficiencies and the overall resolution planning process, we have implemented actions to limit the size of our total non-bank subsidiaries assets to the levels in place as of September 30th, 2016. We\u2019ve already reduced assets to below this level as of year-end and expect to operate at this level for the foreseeable future. We are committed to remediating the two deficiencies identified by the agencies in our revised submission that is due in March and have added significant resources to this effort.", "John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results. John?", "John Shrewsberry", "Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. We earned $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter, the 17th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. Our consistent performance demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model that has continued to perform well through the challenges we\u2019ve faced in recent months. We had solid underlying performance in the quarter including a record level of loans and deposits and strong growth in net interest income. It's important to note that our results in the quarter included the loss of $592 million or $0.07 a share from the impact of net hedge ineffectiveness accounting. Slide 8 provides more details on our long-term debt hedging program.", "As we\u2019ve previously discussed as part of our overall asset/liability management program, we typically swap our fixed rate long term debt to floating rate in order to balance our deposit oriented liability structure and better align with the interest rate sensitivity characteristics of our assets. We also issue non-U.S. dollar long term debt to diversify our funding sources and a portion of that debt is swapped to U.S. dollars. While we believe this hedging strategy is prudent from an asset/liability management perspective it\u2019s generally not possible to achieve a perfect accounting hedge due to the differences in the required valuation measurement of the hedging instrument and the hedged item. As a result this can produce hedge ineffectiveness gains and losses from quarter-to-quarter as interest and exchange rates change. However, the hedge ineffectiveness recognized over the life of the hedging relationships is expected to be zero as long as the hedge accounting is maintained and the hedges are held to maturity.", "In 2016, we experienced significant quarterly volatility and hedge ineffectiveness due to key interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, including a hedge ineffectiveness gain, net of related economic hedges of $379 million in the first quarter and a net loss of $592 million in the fourth quarter. However the 2016 full year net hedge ineffectiveness accounting impact on our results was a loss of only $15 million. FASB has issued an exposure draft on hedge accounting guidelines and new guidance is expected to be issued in 2017. If issued in its current form, the interest rate related ineffectiveness associated with our long term debt hedges would be significantly reduced.", "Turning to Page 9, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. We had strong loan growth up $6.3 billion from third quarter on commercial loan growth. Consumer loans were reduced by the $3.8 billion deconsolidation of certain previously sold reverse mortgage loans following the sale of the related servicing in the fourth quarter. Investment securities increased $17.1 billion with $44 billion of purchases, predominantly agency MBS. The growth in this portfolio as well as a smaller balance sheet drove the $32.3 billion decline in short term investments and Fed funds sold.", "Deposit growth was also strong up $30.2 billion from third quarter with increases in commercial, consumer and small business banking balances and our short term borrowings declined $27.9 billion reflecting lower repurchase balances. Credit quality remains solid and we had a reserve release for the first time in 2016 which was $100 million in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to the income statement overview on Page 10, while revenue declined from the third quarter we had strong growth in net interest income up $450 million and our NIM increased 5 basis points. Non-interest income declined $1.2 billion driven by net hedging ineffectiveness, accounting losses, as well as lower trading and mortgage banking results which I will discuss later. Other sources of non-interest income were diversified and relatively stable. There are a lot of linked quarter changes and specific expense categories this quarter which I will highlight later in the call, but in total expenses were down $53 million from the third quarter.", "As shown on Page 11 loans increased $6.3 billion from third quarter with broad based growth across many of our commercial and consumer portfolios. Our auto portfolio was an exception as balances declined $587 million from third quarter. To respond to conditions in the competitive landscape and to maintain our risk tolerances we've tightened our underwriting standards. Auto originations in the fourth quarter were $6.4 billion down 21% from the third quarter and down 15% from a year ago. We currently expect balances in our auto portfolio to continue to decline in the near term.", "On Page 12 we show year-over-year loan growth. I'm not going to highlight each portfolio but our commercial growth was strong across many businesses and asset classes and the $3.8 billion deconsolidation of reverse mortgage loans reduced the growth rate of our 1-4 family first mortgage loan portfolio.", "As highlighted on Page 13, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67.4 billion or 6% from a year ago with growth in both commercial and consumer deposits. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost increased four basis points from a year ago driven by commercial deposit pricing. There was little to no market response to the rate hike in December 2015 and we currently believe that deposits betas from the rate hike in December 2016 will also be low, at least initially. Indications so far support this view, but we continue to monitor the market to ensure we remain competitive for our customers while maintaining our disciplined relationship based pricing strategy.", "Net interest income was up $450 million or 4% from the third quarter reflecting growth in loans and investment securities, higher interest incomes on trading assets and higher income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and fees. There was also a modest benefit from higher interest rates in the quarter. Net interest margin increased five basis points from the third quarter driven by growth in earning assets including deployment of cash into investments and the net benefit from higher interest rates. Income from variable sources benefited the NIM by approximately two basis points. Our growth in earning assets in the higher rate environment continue to benefit net interest income as we remain asset sensitive. However first quarter will reflect the impact from two fewer days and the typical linked quarter reduction in income from variable sources.", "Non-interest income declined $1.2 billion from the third quarter including the $592 million of net hedge ineffectiveness accounting losses as well as lower trading and mortgage banking fees. I've already explained the impact from net hedge ineffectiveness, so let me highlight the drivers of our mortgage banking and trading results. Mortgage banking results decreased $250 million from third quarter and included a $163 million decline in mortgage servicing income primarily due to higher unreimbursed servicing costs. These costs increased $109 million in the fourth quarter as a result of actions we took to work through an aged population of FHA foreclosed properties, where we\u2019ve had challenges in repairing and conveying them back to HUD. As a result we increased our estimated cost to resolve these properties in the fourth quarter, however we expect these actions will reduce unreimbursed servicing costs significantly in 2017.", "Residential mortgage origination volume was $72 billion, up $25 billion or 53% from a year ago and up $2 billion from the third quarter. Applications were down 25% from the third quarter and we ended the fourth quarter with a $30 billion unclosed pipeline similar to our pipeline a year ago. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the fourth quarter, down 13 basis points from the third quarter primarily due to a higher mix of correspondent originations in the fourth quarter.", "We currently expect origination volume in the first quarter to be roughly in line with the volume we had in the first quarter of 2016 but down from fourth quarter due to seasonality in the purchases market and lower refi volume driven by higher interest rates.", "On Page 16 we provide some details on trading related revenue and the impact in net interest income and non-interest income. Total trading related revenue was down $378 million from the third quarter, trading related net interest income was up a $146 million in the fourth quarter reflecting higher average trading asset balances as well as $98 million from periodic dividends and carry income on certain hedged trading positions in our equity and RMBS books. The corresponding decline in the value of these hedges was reflected as a loss in net trading activity, so they\u2019re revenue neutral.", "Net trading activities declined due to a $223 million decrease in secondary trading, reflecting lower client volumes compared with the strong third quarter as well as seasonality, fewer trading days in the fourth quarter and lower client demand as clients adapted to the rising rate environment. While our client focused business model typically underperforms the market in periods of high volatility, we believe we successfully managed through the post-election market volatility in the fourth quarter.", "A $106 million of the decline in net trading activities was from deferred compensation trading results which was largely offset in employee benefits expense. Finally, there was a $61 million decline from a change in credit valuation adjustments in the fourth quarter due to market driven changes in credit spreads and higher swap rates. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 total trading related revenue was down $27 million.", "On Page 17 we highlight the five quarter trend across major fee categories, compared with a year ago many of our fee businesses grew including deposit accounts, brokerage, investment banking, card and mortgage originations. This page illustrates that while many businesses had above average results in the fourth quarter, total non-interest income reflected below average mortgage servicing income and lower market sensitive revenue which was down $526 million from a year ago.", "As shown on Page 18 expenses declined $53 million from the third quarter, but our efficiency ratio increased to 61.2% primarily driven by the impact of net hedge ineffectiveness losses on our revenue. Our efficiency ratio for the full year was 59.3%. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level. While total expenses were relatively flat from the third quarter there were some meaningful changes in some specific expense items in the fourth quarter. Personal expenses were down a $195 million from the third quarter primarily due to lower revenue related incentive compensation, lower deferred compensation expense and one fewer payroll day. As a reminder we will have seasonally higher personal expenses in the first quarter reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense.", "We have typically higher outside professional services, equipment and advertising expenses in the fourth quarter, and combined these categories increased $394 million from the third quarter. This increase was also driven by higher project spending and legal expense. Operating losses declined $334 million from third quarter on lower litigation accruals. And all other expenses declined $116 million from third quarter which included a $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo foundation.", "As we highlight on Page 19, we remain focused on expense management and efficiency. We\u2019ve been working on a number of initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year-end 2018 with the full year benefits starting in 2019. This is not a new focus, we\u2019re just providing you with more detail in our initiative this quarter to reduce expenses.", "We\u2019ve summarized these opportunities into three categories and included the stage of completion on the right of this page. The largest opportunity relates to centralization and optimization. We\u2019ve started to make changes in how we\u2019re organized to reduce complexity and redundancy by continuing to realign staff areas including marketing, finance and technology. These changes should not only reduce cost, but should also enable us to more seamlessly serve customers and team members.", "We remain focused on reducing discretionary spending in areas like facilities, non-customer related travel and third party spending. And as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, we\u2019re also focused on selective divestitures of non-core sub-scale businesses which includes the sale of our crop insurance and health benefit services businesses last year. We also formed the payments, virtual solutions and innovation group which will accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products.", "While these efforts should have a meaningful impact to certain expense categories, there will not be a bottom line impact as these savings will be reinvested in the business. Our expense focus enables us to operate more efficiently, generate meaningful expense savings and continue to invest to drive future growth, all while continuing to have a strong efficiency ratio.", "Let me take some time to discuss our branch strategy in more detail, it\u2019s along with each and every business within the company as part of our focus on discretionary spending. We continuously evaluate our branch network and while our physical distribution strategy is driven by customer behavior. While branches continue to be a critical component in serving our customers\u2019 needs, our investment in digital capabilities has enabled us to seamlessly serve our customers across channels providing them with more choice and convenience in how they bank with us. And as a result, more transactions are occurring outside the branch.", "Our strategy is also influenced by geographical differences in our individual markets, economic trends and competitor actions to close or open branches. Once external trends indicate that there is an opportunity for branch closures, we focused on the customer impact. Additionally, we evaluate the CRA impact and the branch profitability and other key criteria to maximize expense savings and minimize revenue loss. Based on observed trends in customer behavior, we began to accelerate branch closures in 2016 and closed 84 branches mostly in the second half of the year. We expect the pace of branch closures to increase to 200 branches in 2017 and we expect closures at that level or slightly higher in 2018.", "There also continues to be opportunities for de novos in some attractive markets. Many of the closures this year will be in closed proximity to another branch and therefore we don\u2019t expect a significant revenue or team member impact. The full year expense benefit usually occurs one to two years after the branch is closed. We will be providing more details on our branch distribution strategy at our May Investor Day.", "Turning to our business segments starting on Page 21, community banking earned $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter down 14% from a year ago and down 15% from third quarter. The declines were primarily due to net hedge ineffectiveness losses and lower mortgage banking results. We\u2019ve already discussed many of the business trends within community banking, so I won't go into any more details here.", "Wholesale banking earned $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from a year ago and up 7% from the third quarter. Revenue was $7.2 billion, up 9% from a year ago driven by 16% growth in net interest income. Balance sheet growth was strong with both deposits and loans at record levels. Loan growth was broad based with average loans up $44.5 billion or 11% from a year ago, the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. And we have completed the final phase of the GE Capital's portfolio acquisitions in October.", "Wealth and investment management earned $653 million in the fourth quarter, up 10% from a year ago and down 4% from the third quarter which was a record quarter. Fourth quarter results reflected strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 14% from a year ago. Average deposits were up 10% and average loans increased 11% from a year ago, the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. WIM total client assets reached a record high in the fourth quarter of $1.7 trillion, up 7% from a year ago driven by higher market valuations and continued positive net flows.", "Turning to Page 24, net charge-offs increased $100 million from the third quarter with 37 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Commercial losses were up $36 million driven by $32 million in lower recoveries. Consumer loses increased $64 million driven by higher losses in credit card, auto and other revolving credit and installment loans due to seasonality, higher severity in auto losses and a movement toward more normalized losses in unsecured lending. Residential real estate portfolios continue to improve with net charge-offs down $28 million or 41% from the third quarter. Our first mortgage loan portfolio had net recoveries in the fourth quarter and we had only 38 basis points of loss in our Junior lien portfolio.", "Non-performing assets continued to decline down $644 million from the third quarter with improvements across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. We had a reserve released of $100 million reflecting continued improvement in our residential real estate portfolio and stabilization in our oil and gas portfolio performance.", "Slide 25 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstanding continued to decline down 8% from the third quarter and down 15% from a year ago. We had $177 million of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter with all losses from the E&P and services sectors. Given the current environment we continue to believe that losses peaked in the second quarter of 2016. Non-accrual loans were $2.4 billion, down $84 million from the third quarter and criticized loans declined $776 million or 11%.", "Turning to Page 26, our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in was stable at 10.7%, well above our internal target of 10% which includes the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. We repurchased 24.9 million common shares in the fourth quarter and entered into a $750 million forward repurchase transaction which settled this week for 14.7 million shares. We returned $3 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.", "The final TLAC accrual was issued in December and becomes effective on January 1, 2019. We estimate that as of December 31, 2016 we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $18 billion in order to be compliant. This shortfall is lower than our previous estimates which were based on the proposed rule due primarily to the grandfathering of existing debt governed under foreign law in the final rule. It also was impacted by lower RWA levels at year end. However the removal of the phase-in period in the final rule will result in a modest acceleration of our issuance plan. We issued a total of $32 billion of qualifying TLAC in 2016 and we currently expect issuance in 2017 will be at a similar level to fund both maturities and our targeted build of qualifying debt.", "In summary our results in the fourth quarter demonstrated solid underlying performance as we continued to meet our customers' financial needs. We had record levels of loans, deposits and client assets. Our credit quality, liquidity and capital all remained strong. We once again earned more than $5 billion in the quarter demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model which continued to perform well during a period where we faced unique challenges.", "It's been only four months since we signed the sales practices consent orders but we've already made progress in restoring customers and team members trust and we remain committed to being transparent with investors while there is still more work to do we're confident that we will build a better Wells Fargo that will continue to meet our customers' financial needs. Benefit the communities we serve and provide opportunities for our team members and investors.", "And we can now take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein, please go ahead.", "John McDonald", "I wanted to ask about the rate sensitivity profile, John. I was wondering if there's been any change in the core rate sensitivity and could you remind us what kind of benefit do you get from the Fed hike that we got in December?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. So we're still in the -- I think we're in the 5% to 15% range, which is what we talked about the last time our Treasurer, Neal Blinde presented more broadly, that hasn't really changed very much. I think we've estimated that the quarterly impact -- a full quarterly impact of a 25 basis point parallel shift, which is different than what we got in December, although arguably we got more than that in the long end, is worth in the order of a $150 million per quarter and that estimation still holds as well.", "John McDonald", "I know you put some swaps on in maybe 2015 it was, which muted what would have been your maybe natural asset sensitivity. Just wondering as to maybe you're thinking about the rate environment evolves, are you able to get out of that and adapt that or is that locked in for a few years? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Those hedges will be in place for a few years. They\u2019re captured in this calculation of our rate sensitivity and so if you think about LIBOR based commercial loans as the hedged item there those won\u2019t float up and that incremental benefit won't be passed along in the near term as a result of the choice to fix those out and to earn higher interest income in previous periods and to change their profile.", "So that's not where the benefit would come from, it\u2019s other floating rate loans, it's incremental floating rate loans in those categories that haven't been hedged. But those -- that program was a result of a specific decision to reduce interest rate sensitivity in a period that felt lower for longer and there will be other assets that float up that create a benefit on the [Multiple Speakers].", "John McDonald", "I guess your sensitivity also will come from your liquidity deployment. It looks like you put some to work this quarter with the Fed fund sold down $30 billion. I know you get asked this all the time but is there a way for us to think about how much of that $270 billion or so of liquidity is deployable and flexible dry powder versus needed to meet the various liquidity and other requirements?", "John Shrewsberry", "I think we're sticking with 10s of billions at any point in time as incrementally deployable. This relationship between the liquidity value of whatever we might be incrementally investing in and there are limitations as you know on certain -- the definitions of certain assets is either high quality liquid assets or not. And then there is the capital impact of moving too far out the curve and increasing our exposure to diminution and OCI in a rising rate environment. So there are a lot of tradeoffs to be made. We're making them all the time with that -- with the same outcome in mind that you're curious about. We will be deploying more in a higher rate entry point, but subject to those constraints and what it means for capital and what it means for liquidity versus holding cash.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Ken Usdin", "Tim and John, I think people are really appreciative of the incremental, just putting a number around the work you're already doing on the cost side. You did however mention that you expect to reinvest it. So, I was wondering if you could help us understand your comments just about the efficiency ratio remaining high. Does that mean high relative to your historical 55%, 59% range or does it mean high end? And just how would you help us understand just how you get from point A to point B and how we start to see efficiency improvement over time?", "Tim Sloan", "So, John I\u2019ll start and then you jump in. I think Ken the efficiency ratio metrics that we set out at our Investor Day last year are really guidelines for us to operate in in the environment that we expected to turn the clock back to last May. We think that 55% to 59% range is best-in-class in the industry and the range that we're expecting to operate in for the next couple of years. Things have changed clearly, and expectations have changed, but the efficiency ratio is a function of not only your expense rate, but also revenue growth and we're hopeful that we'll continue to grow revenue overtime as we did over the last year in 2016.", "And our guidance is that, in the short term as revenue continues to grow and we continue to have some headwinds from an expense standpoint and the first quarter is going to be a good example of that because we'll have some impact from annual incentive compensation impact and so on, that we\u2019ll going to be at the high end, and again we think about this expense ratio -- our efficiency ratio, excuse me, not on our quarterly basis, but as much year-over-year. So, our expectations for 2017 is that we\u2019ll probably be at the high end of that range.", "John Shrewsberry", "And the only thing I'd add is that, and this is implied, but to the extent that we're getting revenue increases from interest income then that's substantially more efficient in terms of dollars of expense per dollar of revenue then most sources of non-interest income. So, there should be a lift if we\u2019re getting it in interest income.", "Ken Usdin", "That's great, John. And that's actually my follow-up, as well, is that you do seem to have a decent path towards NII growth from the factors that you've talked about, and to John's questions before. Can you talk about just some of the moving parts inside fees in terms of how those businesses feel? The brokerage business has flattened out, but maybe hopefully it's turned the corner. And then obviously there is the mortgage side of things, which obviously with rates, the unclosed pipeline is down a little bit. So, what drives fee growth as you look ahead? Where do you see the most opportunities? And what are the things that we have to just be mindful of?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. The big sources, setting mortgage aside because we talked about it a little bit in the prepared comments and I think you just nailed it, we\u2019re in that lower point in the refi cycle. So it\u2019s really about getting after the purchase needs of our customers and then those refi that do come up, but applications are down across the industry and I think people expect that in general. So what that yields will depend on the path of where rates go, how jobs are formed and what the demand is for home buying.", "In our other big sources, deposit, deposit service charges, our customers are using our products more than ever, so we\u2019ve had good growth in debit card and we\u2019ll continue to work there and now we need to continue to attract new customers to the bank in order for that to grow like it has in the past, that is an area of focus for Mary as she launches her new program in community banking and of course a lot of that also comes from the commercial side of things where we\u2019re a leader in providing treasury management services to our corporate customers as well. So -- and that\u2019s been a growing business for us over the last several years.", "On the card side, new credit card applications are down, but for the cards that we have out there and the cards that we are originating now, people are using them more, they\u2019re transacting more, they\u2019re spending more, their balances are higher, et cetera. So those have driven good sources. And then with respect to brokerage, obviously we\u2019re at high market levels right now so we expect good fees from that as well as institutional asset management, but with David Carroll\u2019s teams focus on meeting the saving for retirement and investing needs of all of our banking customers, my sense is that there continues to be an opportunity there also. We have to execute along all of those dimensions, but there is a real path forward.", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah, I would just reinforce the opportunity we have in wealth and investment management, as John said David and team did a terrific job last year and when you think about growing that business 10% year-over-year and just couldn\u2019t be more pleased with those performance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ", "Erika Najarian ", "I just wanted to get some clarification on the response to Ken's question. As we think about the reduction of expenses and investing it back by year-end 2018, does that mean that the expense base on an absolute basis could potentially be flattish in 2018? Or is that too simplistic to think about because we really have to think about the revenue side, as well? I'm just trying to think about whether or not we should think about the $2 billion as something that can self-fund investments in 2018 or we really should be going back to the 55% to 59% efficiency ratio guidance.", "John Shrewsberry", "I would say with the latter.", "Tim Sloan", "I would too.", "John Shrewsberry", "Because you never know where a dollar of revenue is going to come from and especially on the non-interest income side, the mix matters in terms of what it\u2019s related expenses are and so I wouldn\u2019t be predicting a couple of years forward what that mix is going to look like or what the associated expense impact is going to look like at the margins from a dollar of one sort of non-interest income versus another, I would think about it as these are undertakings that we have going on to accomplish all of our incremental spending and still stay in 55% to 59% on an annual basis.", "Erika Najarian", "And just to clarify, it sounds like if we do get a structurally higher curve, like you said in previous calls, that could really drive the path to the middle or lower end of that 55% to 59% efficiency ratio target.", "Tim Sloan", "Overtime, over time, but again Erika I mean it\u2019s a function of so many other different variables. I mean not just interest rates, but just fundamental economic growth. If the economy grows at 3% is better than 2% and that means its loan was going to be higher and maybe other activity will be higher. I would just reinforce John\u2019s comment, just to think about that 55% to 59% that we\u2019re going to save a lot of money here at Wells Fargo, and we\u2019re going to reinvest that business for the long-term that will pay benefits well beyond the next couple of years.", "John Shrewsberry", "I do think it\u2019s reasonable though to say to get to the lower end of the range it\u2019s going to be because of the impact of higher rates on interest income.", "Erika Najarian", "Okay. And just if I could squeeze one last question in here, in the back of the retail sales issue there has been a lot of focus on new account openings. And I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of whether or not the profitability of your primary customer has really been impacted by the scandal. Because as I've been talking to investors about this, does new account opening really matter if that credit card was not being used anyway or was sitting in a drawer? I guess I\u2019m wondering if we could -- I know you've given a lot of detail already, but I'm wondering if the new account openings statistics sort of overstates what the revenue impact to your primary customer is from the retail sales scandal.", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. And I think the short answer is it\u2019s too new to tell. The value of a relationship tends to increase overtime, and generally relationships are a little bit less profitable at the beginning than they might be two years from now and four years from now and five years from now. So, I don\u2019t mean not to ask [indiscernible] question Erika, so we\u2019ll have to reduce your question next quarter. But the fact of the matter is that I think it\u2019s just too early to tell. We\u2019re just excited that we saw what seems to be an inflection point in the midst of the fourth quarter. And so we\u2019re starting to see some real positive attributes in some of those metrics, not only in terms of accounts activity, but also in terms of customer service and experience.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "I wanted to follow up on a comment earlier. I think you said -- I just want to make sure I didn't hear it incorrectly, but have you promised to keep the absolute size of your balance sheet at the 9-30 [ph] level? Is that the entire balance sheet or was that just segments? Did I miss something there?", "Tim Sloan", "No. What we said is that, we\u2019ll keep our non-bank subsidiary balance sheet at the 9-30 level. And that accounts for probably 10% of our overall balance sheet. ", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Okay. All right. So from my point of view not that big of a deal. Just separately, you guys have talked about that there's a third-party review of all layers of management into the sales practicing and what was known and what wasn't known. There's an article, I think, this past weekend just talking about emails being reviewed. I can appreciate that takes a very long time for a firm your size, but any thoughts on when that would be concluded and when and how it would be communicated to investors and analysts?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, think of the review in terms of sales practices in two parts. One is a requirement under the consent orders with the OCC and the CFPB to have a third party consultant come in and take a look at sales practices, primarily in our retail related business and so that's just begun. My guess is that will take the good part of this year to accomplish and then separately because you know as I said in my earlier remarks we want to leave no stone unturned here, we've said that -- and we have brought in a separate consultant to look at sales practice across other businesses within the company. And my guess it will take much of this year to complete that work and if we find something that's important, we'll communicate that, but if nothing happens we may not communicate it. But we\u2019ll take it as it comes, but I think given our desire to be very transparent we'll probably err on the side of over communicating as opposed to under communicating that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI, please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "Back to the sales practice issue, given that you're seeing some turn, some inflection here that you cited in some of these metrics and everything, are you in any better position to help quantify what you would say would be the all-in recurring financial impact of the issue, both with the foregone revenue as well as the related expense impact from this?", "Tim Sloan", "No, I would say not. But John jump in if you feel differently. Just because we're -- this has been going on for at least the last quarter or so and while we're pleased with what we think is hopefully an inflection point. We may have months over the next few months where things turn the other way again for a month. But what we're really focused on is the long term trend. In the short term the revenue impact has not been significant, but we want to be careful about that, is that to the extent that we're growing primary checking accounts at 3% instead of 5%, over time that would have a bigger impact. So I would still put it in the category of too new to rate.", "John Shrewsberry", "One specific I can add is that I'd estimated for the next several quarters we\u2019re probably a $40 million to $50 million this quarter of outside professional service fees which includes the third party [Multiple Speakers] incremental, which includes the reviewing third parties and law firms as well and that probably grows a little bit and then tails off. So that's incremental.", "John Pancari", "All right, thank you. And then, separately, I know you were alluding to this a little bit earlier with the asset sensitivity questions, but I just wanted to see if I can get some thoughts on your NIM trajectory here in coming quarters, just given the TLAC pace now is going to be a little bit quicker and that's a negative drag. But also you've got the impact of the rate hike. So, how would you be thinking about the trajectory of the margin here through \u201917?", "John Shrewsberry", "So I'd rather talk about it in dollars if those are useful to you, because NIM is really an outcome and we can't predict what exactly is going to happen with deposit flows, et cetera. But just to put a dollar sign on it, if we don't get any more moves by the Fed in 2017, and I anticipate that we might, but if we didn't given that their pace of TLAC issuance that you mentioned, given the balance sheet positioning today, given what we might expect from loan growth, what we could imagine from redeployment et cetera, we're -- it's pretty easy to sketch out a 4%, 5%, 6% net interest income growth trajectory, full year '17 over full year '16. What that means for a NIM because of what the balances are, that are applied to that, is a little harder to pin down.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.", "Paul Miller", "You talked about in the beginning of the call that you've gone all the way back to 2011. But I know there's been some discussion in the media and some politicians of going back farther than that. Are the regulators good with you going as back to 2011? Or do you need to go back farther later on?", "Tim Sloan", "Paul good question and let me clarify, under the consent orders we're required to go back a little bit earlier in 2011 than we have previously done and then bring forward the analysis to September of 2016 to the date more or less that we've signed the consent orders, that's the regulatory requirement. We've decided, right -- this is the management of the company not any third parties located anywhere else around the country, have decided that we think it's appropriate to go back and look at 2009 and 2010, that's something that we announced in late September, October and so we're in the midst of doing that but think about that as a separate effort outside of the consent order requirements to make things right for our customers.", "Paul Miller", "Okay. So, the 2011 is a consent order, you're willing to go back as far as 2009. And have you had discussions with people in Congress who were asking you guys to go back even further than that? Does that satisfy their needs?", "Tim Sloan", "Well I'll leave satisfaction rates in Congress to them. We think that it's important to go back and look at 2009 and '10, we've picked that timeframe because that's when we Wells Fargo and Wachovia together, and we think that's right from our perspective. It's well beyond the requirements that our regulators set for us. So, we're in the midst to doing that.", "Paul Miller", "And then my follow-up question, I did ask this of Jamie Dimon, but I was wondering what your thoughts of it, on the mortgage world the credit box is really, really continuing to be tight. And you heard a lot of the new administration guys talking about opening up the credit box. Can they open up the credit box effectively? And what do you guys want to hear for you guys to start drawing down and opening up the credit box in the mortgage world?", "Tim Sloan", "Well it\u2019s a good question. We think it's very important to continue and to provide a broad suite of mortgage options to our customers and we think we do that better than anybody in the industry, we've got the number one share and we're satisfying customers every day. There is no question that there have been certain rules and regulations that have been promulgated over the last eight years which have impacted and provided some concern in the industry not just with big banks in terms of how we provide credit, some of it is related to the fact that we all, we\u2019re part of servicing settlements that went back decades almost and which were a surprise to everybody.", "So I think the more that there can be clarification, and FHA is a great example, the more that there can be clarification on any uncertainty in the future, the better. Having said that, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made in terms and performance of our first mortgage product which is focused on first time homebuyers. That the volumes has exceeded our expectations and so we\u2019re just really pleased with the fact that we\u2019ve had a very strong origination year and you know the credit quality within the mortgage businesses has just continued to exceed our expectations. As John noted in his remarks we had net recoveries in the fourth quarter from our first mortgage business.", "So we\u2019re really pleased with the position that we have in the mortgage business we\u2019re hopeful that the new administration can continue to provide clarification in terms of that business and we look forward to working with them.", "John Shrewsberry", "Two things I would add, we\u2019re not looking for a way to put lower credit quality first mortgages on our balance sheet. So if there are others who are looking for loosening the box for that outcome, I don\u2019t think that that would apply here. And as it relates broadly to tightening the credit box as a result of financial crisis, it\u2019s really about underwriting the ability to repay and that\u2019s what constraining how much money people can borrow or whether they can borrow and it\u2019s a reasonable requirement, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re operating. So, customers have to be able to provide evidence of their ability to repay, so more jobs, et cetera. It advances that cause versus making it -- lowering the requirement for the ability to repay.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ", "Vivek Juneja ", "Couple of questions, one your guidance for the efficiency ratio remaining to the high end of the range, near term. What assumptions do you have baked in for rate hikes and when you\u2019re defining rate, I am presuming near-term, I\u2019m presuming you\u2019re thinking 2017?", "John Shrewsberry", "In our own internal analysis there is one in the middle of the year and one at the end of the year. So, not much in terms of the short end of the curve providing incremental interest income is in that calculation.", "Vivek Juneja ", "Okay. Right, and so then this full notion of the 2 billion savings that you\u2019re talking about, that\u2019s going to come over the course of the \u201917 and \u201918, and then the investments also coming during the same time frame, is there any timing differences in those and that\u2019s all supposed to be at the same time? [Multiple Speakers].", "John Shrewsberry", "It's self-funded at the same time.", "Vivek Juneja ", "Okay. So completely different question. Living well, what went wrong with that and the changes that you have to make, what kind of implications will that have for you in terms of your numbers. ", "Tim Sloan", "So, fair question. The focus of the regulators on our -- the submission -- the resubmission that we made last fall related to legal entities and shared services and so what we\u2019re in the midst of doing is having as I mentioned some very good quality meetings with the regulators to make sure that we appreciate with their expectations are. And focused on providing more detail to them in terms of how we manage risk related to all of our legal entities. And then how we -- our shared services would operate in the midst of a catastrophe at Wells Fargo, actually we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to occur.", "And so we\u2019ve redoubled our efforts there, we\u2019ve added some additional folks and additional resources, and we\u2019re going to work very hard and improve the quality of our submission which is due at the end of March. I don't fundamentally believe that it's going to affect our ability to serve our customers and rebuild trust in any way, shape or form. But we were disappointed and we\u2019ve got to make some improvements and we\u2019ll do it.", "Vivek Juneja ", "And will that legal entity change, would that make any changes to your fund, your liquidity, any of that, any comment, any color on that at this point?", "Tim Sloan", "Well at the margin it might impact some things, but not materially to that. ", "John Shrewsberry", "There might be some prepositioning of capital liquidity into various entities, but from your perspective it wouldn\u2019t have a meaningful difference.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ", "Marty Mosby ", "I had a couple of well more micro and small issues and then I had a big question for you Tim at the end. We're looking at the servicing. Usually the servicing fees would kick in when rates started to go up. However, you had that unreimbursable cost. Your servicing fees dropped down to 18 basis points was about the lower I\u2019ve seen. That is temporary and should rebound back to a more normal 20-ish type of base points going forward, I think I heard you say that.", "John Shrewsberry", "So, servicing fees that are coming off of the unpaid principle balance of our servicing portfolio will track how big the servicing portfolio is. And it has shrunk overtime as prepayments have been faster, frankly faster than our share of the origination market, as we\u2019ve existed different types of businesses to de-risk both our mortgage origination as well as mortgage servicing business like the reverse mortgage portfolio we sold this quarter for $4 billion of unpaid principle balance like several of these origination program that we deem higher risk overtime. ", "So the notional that is driving the contractual servicing fee stream has been coming down and as you\u2019d expect we think it will stabilize now, because we\u2019re -- prepayment should sort of halt or a creep in a higher rate environment. But as you say in a higher environment, we\u2019d also expect that the flow towards more as we as escrows and taxes and insurance and other things, those are worth more to us in a higher rate environment than in a lower rate environment, and that should start to work its way in overtime. ", "And then specifically on unreimbursed foreclosure costs, on the one hand we\u2019re working down the long-term cyclical amount of foreclosed properties, et cetera, that need to be worked out of the system. We\u2019re originating those types of loans, FHA loans in particular at a much slower pace than we were previously. And now we\u2019ve taken this step, where we\u2019ve taken charges in Q4 that we think are really going to reduce the rate of that expense in 2017. So, I would expect servicing revenue in general to be meaningfully positively impacted by that last piece in particular.", "Marty Mosby ", "And then when you look at the hedge ineffectiveness where you had the -- related to your long-term debt, I would assume that the credit spread comparison, in other words, the real basis risk changed, was your credit spread gapped out with the reputational issues that you're working through right now in the marketplace, and that drove a large part of this negative. So that would be an unusual in this particular quarter. Would that be correct?", "John Shrewsberry", "I don't think that's as big a driver as you think. It's really, it's a portion of it because you're discounting that leg of the hedged relationship with A, credit spread in it, and B, the swap leg you're not. But it has more to do with the direction of rates and the amount of the uptick in the swap rate over a short period of time than our spreads. You can see the impact of our spreads in Q3 versus Q4 in our net CVA outcomes on the trading side of things because we generated positive P&L in the third quarter from our own spreads gapping out and then we didn\u2019t have that in the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s a -- those are relatively small numbers for Wells Fargo.", "Marty Mosby ", "Okay. And then Tim, the big question is, Mary Mack's gone around now and you said talked to 3,000 team members. Is the environment such that had she would have done that a year ago or two years ago, nobody would really want to step up and say anything bad about the Company because everybody was thinking of it as such a hot performing institution. Is the flow of information freeing up so you're getting some really good information and ways to improve along a lot of different lines with these town hall meetings?", "Tim Sloan", "Oh absolutely Marty, and that's part of the -- you know when we think about rebuilding trust at the company, rebuilding trust is not only with external stakeholders, but candidly it's primarily -- the primary focus was 268,000 team members. If we don\u2019t rebuild trust with all of them then we\u2019ve got bigger issues and I think Mary's outreach in terms of her town halls and she's been tireless in terms of these town halls is very important and many of the other senior leaders within the company have had similar town halls and have been out there more than we've ever been, talking to our team members and the way that we're getting feedback from our team is not just through those town halls, but also through requests that we make to them through surveys and we're getting all kinds of great ideas in terms of how to improve Wells Fargo and many of them that we're implementing.", "So I'm really pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of our internal communication and we're seeing that in terms of some of the feedback that we're getting from our team members and that translates into better service for our customers and personally I think that's one of the drivers. I mentioned that in my earlier remarks in terms of the improvement in the customer experience scores in retail. I couldn't be more pleased with that performance given the circumstances.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC, please go ahead.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Tim, I think you touched on that you raised the wages of your lower wage workers well above the Federal Minimum Wage. Can you share with us what that will do for operating -- compensation expenses in 2017? I know seasonally first quarter everybody has the uptick in employment expenses, but what will that do for expenses this year?", "Tim Sloan", "So, a fair question and I'll give you an answer that's probably a little bit frustrating, so I apologize in advance, and that is that, we don't really look at it that way. Because one of the reasons why we wanted to increase the minimum levels of compensation is that we want some other positive outcomes. So outcomes like lower turnover and that could be a -- have a net impact and would have a net impact and we think it will have a net impact on whatever the expense number might be.", "Lower turnover means lower training cost, it means a higher productivity because you've got more experienced bankers, tellers, service folks, that are working with our customers, so net-net overtime making this decision we think is a net positive for the company so we really don't look at it as gosh it's going to have this kind of an impact in a certain period of time, because the other outcomes that I mentioned aren't really known until we look back a year from now.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Fair enough. And then the follow-up question is, can you guys give us some color on how the GECC acquisition is performing, how the integration has gone? Have you been very pleased with it? Just some color there.", "Tim Sloan", "Any acquisition and integration is complicated. And so my answer will not do justice to the incredible amount of hard work and effort to all of the 100s of people if not 1,000s of people within the company that have been working hard on that integration. But overall I would tell you it has exceeded our expectations. The quality of team members that we were able to bring on from GE has just been very impressive, their engagement in the business and how happy they are to be part of Wells Fargo is very encouraging.", "The quality of the customer base that we were able to bring on has exceeded our expectation and those customers are doing more business with us and one of the opportunities that we have overtime is to broaden those relationships because GECC which was a terrific lender, was just that, a lender, and we have other products and services that we can provide to their customer base, so if this is the nine-inning game, the first inning we put some points on the board and score some runs and hopefully we'll continue to do that, but again long answer to your question, so far so good.", "Operator", "You're next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Saul Martinez", "I wanted to discuss the branch rationalization strategy a little bit, what the thought process is there, especially the thought process around the 200 branches. You have a slide where you have some bullets around some of the factors that you consider when you close a branch. But when I look at that number, it's about 3% of your branch network, the 200 figure. You've closed fewer branches than perhaps some of your peers have in recent years.", "But I guess the bigger question is, whether you can do a little bit more there and whether you can pull the cost lever harder through a bit more aggressive branch rationalization. Just wanted to go through the branch strategy and how you think about that and what some of the factors are in determining that 200 figure per year.", "Tim Sloan", "I'll start and John jump in, it's a great question. What you saw last year is us increasing the pace of branch rationalization, so that 80 plus that we closed last year, most of that was in the second half and what that\u2019s reflecting is us listening to our customers in terms of how they want to do business with us they still want to come in to branches, but they also are accessing us via online and mobile, and through ATMs, and on the phone. So our strategy is really based upon listening to customers and looking at their habits and how they want to interact with us and based upon that we think it makes sense and Mary\u2019s has had an opportunity to oversee the business for the last six months and what we\u2019ve concluded is that we should increase the pace of rationalization to about 200 this year.", "I wouldn\u2019t describe that as our long-term branch strategy, because again it\u2019s really a function of reactions and habits from our customers. We may increase, we may decrease, who knows, it\u2019s going to be based upon how they want to do business with us. But what we\u2019re seeing right now is, it leads us to the conclusion to be focused on that 200 branch number for the year.", "John Shrewsberry", "I think that\u2019s right and we\u2019ll continue to -- they\u2019ll be a feedback loop from this process to see how customers react to it, whether we\u2019re right or wrong about the customer attrition, deposit attrition or other things that we\u2019re trying to minimize by taking the strategy that we\u2019re taking and if six months into this, we think there is an opportunity to do more, then we\u2019ll come back and we\u2019ll do that.", "And we\u2019ll talk in some more detail at our May Investor Day about the process that we used to analyze this, why we think this is the right approach to take, some of the idiosyncrasies of our branch footprint versus the others that you\u2019re familiar with just in terms of owned, leased, that cost to operate, et cetera. We\u2019ve got branches, there is a lot of them as you might know in very low cost locations and so the expense pick up that you might be imagining may not be exactly the same as if they were all in coastal communities or major metropolitan areas, et cetera. There is a lot of differences from one to the other. But this is the beginning of a process where we\u2019re picking up and the whole time customers will be reflecting in their use of physical versus virtual, how much they value coming into our branches and we can keep feeding that back.", "Saul Martinez", "Great, that's helpful. Just a quick follow-up on an earlier question, what proportion of your employees are affected by the minimum wage hike? Do you have that figure?", "John Shrewsberry", "It\u2019s about 26,000 people. ", "Saul Martinez", "Okay, got it. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. ", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Just two questions, please. One is, you mentioned the tightening of some of your underwriting standards and portions of the auto portfolio. Could you just maybe give us a little insight into what you were doing and where, whether it's in the credit spectrum or new versus used or how that's playing out?", "John Shrewsberry", "So, we\u2019ve been holding fast on term. I think we\u2019ve talked about this with this group before, but there is between leasing as a competitive product or just other lenders willingness to go to seven years and beyond more frequently than we are. That has cost us to lose some volumes, sticking by that. And the other two areas I think are proof of income, on the one hand, which is part of how we try to underwrite credit and then back to ability to repay.", "You mentioned new versus used, because we\u2019re not attached to a manufacturer and we don\u2019t have a leasing program, we do are disproportionately a huge car lender and so these are criteria that are meaning full to us and at this part of the cycle its causing us to lose volume.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And I know there's been many questions on OpEx, but I'm afraid I'm still a little confused. I understand certainly where you're coming out in terms of the efficiency ratio. But just in absolute dollar terms, relative to the roughly $52.4 billion that you had in 2016, how should we think about that figure in absolute terms for this year?", "John Shrewsberry", "So the way that I would think about it is, thinking about it from the expense ratio, and I know it\u2019s a little bit frustrating, because again one of the reasons why we think about expenses here is part of that efficiency ratio as its very much a function of revenue opportunities and depending upon which business is generating those revenue opportunities or which product some of them have higher or lower expenses associated with them. But the way that I would think about that $2 billion is we\u2019re going to save that $2 billion over the next couple of years and then we\u2019re going to reinvest it in the business.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. ", "Nancy Bush", "This tags onto Gerard's question. In looking at your new compensation scheme and the fact that it's fairly new, how confident are you in projecting, accruing, et cetera, for comp expenses this year? Were you able to beta test this at all? Or is there wide variability in where the numbers can come out?", "John Shrewsberry", "So, we were able to test it somewhat Nancy, but as you can appreciate the timeframe that we have was a little bit shorter than we would normally have liked.", "Nancy Bush", "Right. ", "John Shrewsberry", "I don\u2019t want to give you the impression that we\u2019re always changing incentive compensation plans for tens of thousands of people in 90 days. So, there is some risk in that we didn\u2019t get it completely right and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I wanted to reinforce the point, and we\u2019re going to watching this very closely and to the extent that we need to make some changes, we\u2019re not going to wait for a year from now, we\u2019ll make some changes.", "But, when I think about the fundamentals of the plan, they were reviewed by Mary and team, we had a lot of discussions with the retail folks, we had it reviewed by our risk folks and HR folks and the likes, and just the fundamentals of basing it on customer service, increasing in primary accounts and household growth, I mean those are all measurable items. ", "Nancy Bush", "Right. ", "John Shrewsberry", "So, we\u2019re not really concerned about having the accruals correct or incorrect. And they\u2019re all very important drivers for growth in relationships and in return satisfied customers and then that will translate into revenue growth overtime.", "Nancy Bush", "Yes. And, secondly, there was another piece of news in the last couple of days where you've gotten a letter, I think, from some members of Congress about the growth in overdraft charges, could you just -- and whether this is somehow linked to the rest of the issues. So, if you could just address that whole overdraft issue, I'd appreciate it.", "Tim Sloan", "Sure. So, I\u2019ll start and John jump in. I\u2019m actually waiting to get the letter. So, you\u2019ve read about it before I've actually received it, but my understanding is that it was based upon some earlier reporting regarding year-to-year increases. Recall that in 2014 we made a number of changes in terms of how we provide information to our customers, how we process payments and deposits and debits and credits and the like, which meant that our deposit or our overdraft income actually declined in 2015 to 2014 and so the year-over-year, again three quarters to three quarters comparison you're seeing '16 to '15 is a reflection of the changes we made in '14, revenue decline in '15 and then growing off that number and the reason it\u2019s growing is not because there's anything nefarious that we're doing or it's part of any sort of retail sales practices issue. It's just a reflection of the fact that we're seeing growth in our customer base and we're seeing more customer activity.", "We think maybe our competitors are making some of the changes that we made a year later and so maybe that's impacting some of their overdraft revenue, but we'll -- I'll be responsive to the letter when I get it and we'll continue to provide the right services to our customer base.", "John Shrewsberry", "Just a little bit more color on that. So we don\u2019t have the largest overdraft revenue base among larger banks. As Tim said we made this change and specifically the change that we made was to post to customers online and mobile account picture items that were being received throughout the course of the day that we're going to post overnight in a batch, so that they have that information before making a determination about whether to overdraft or not.", "We implemented that at the end of '14 and from '14 to '15 and that's good for customers. It was on purpose, it was intended to give people more information to make better decisions about what to do with their money and we dropped an overdraft revenue from '14 to '15 and then as Tim said because the business has grown, because people have gotten used to that information and made different decisions about how they want to run their lives. We picked back from '15 to '16. We're flat from '14 to '16.", "As we understand it, our peers adopted that similar customer friendly technology a year later and so the point of comparison that is available now is their year of adoption versus the period right afterward when customers can react to that information. So it's a little bit of apples and oranges. But our fee levels, our frequency of charging et cetera are right in the middle of the fairway compared to the competitive set, there's nothing different about Wells Fargo's approach to that activity.", "Tim Sloan", "And Nancy the more that we can provide information to our customers so that they can make good decisions about how to manage their money, the better. And we're going to continue to look at ways in which we can use technology particularly through mobile to provide that information, so it\u2019s much more customer friendly to them.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay, alright thank you.", "Operator", "And I'll now turn the conference back over to management for any concluding remarks.", "Tim Sloan", "Great, well again thank you all for spending time with us today, know it's been, it's been a very busy morning for all of you and we appreciate your interest in Wells Fargo and I also just want to reinforce to all of our team members who are listening out there, thank you very much for just a tremendous effort this quarter in the midst of a very challenging period for Wells Fargo, I couldn't be more proud of everything that you've accomplished.", "So, thank you and have a good rest of your day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] ", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe ", "Thank you, Regina, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss second quarter result and answer your questions. This call will be recorded.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings; including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf ", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We earned $5.7 billion in the second quarter, as our diversified business model continued to generate strong loan and deposit growth. Our financial strength and competitive position have allowed us to capture opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisitions.", "In addition, our commitment to managing risk and a benefit of an improving housing market continue to improve our credit results. ", "Let me highlight our growth this quarter compared with one year ago. We earned $1.03 in earnings per share, up 2% from a year ago. We generated $21.3 billion of revenue, up 1% from a year ago with 4% growth in net interest income. We had broad based loan growth with total loans reaching a record $888.5 billion and our core loan portfolio increased by $68.5 billion or 9%.", "Our growth benefited from the $11.5 billion GE Capital loan purchasing and financing transaction in the second quarter. Our deposit franchise continue to generate strong customer and balance growth with average deposits up $83.8 billion or 8% while we reduced deposit costs. ", "We also grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.6%. Our credit performance continued to improve and our net charge-off rate declined to 30 basis points of average loans, the lowest level in 20 years. ", "Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation and returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority. We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 7% to 37.5 cents per common share and we repurchased 36 million shares of common stock.", "We\u2019ve reduced our common shares outstanding for five consecutive quarters with shares down 105 million from one year ago. While recent developments in Europe and Asia have implications for the US economy, the ongoing US economic expansion has remained on track and has entered its seventh year, a feat accomplished only four other times in the US history.", "The labor market continued to recover with a record 57 consecutive months of payroll gains and housing activity has been especially encouraging with second quarter position to be the best quarter performance sales since 2007. These factors, along with an increase in consumer confidence makes me optimistic that the economic expansion will sustain momentum into the second half of the year and Wells Fargo should benefit from the increase in economic activity as we remain focused on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs.", "John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer will now provide more details on our second quarter results. John?", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you, John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions.", "Our results this quarter is straightforward and demonstrate momentum across a variety of key business drivers. We continue to have strong loan and deposit growth across our diversified businesses. We grew net interest income with earning asset growth and our net interest margin improved. Many of our customer-facing businesses generated strong fee growth. Credit quality improved and we had lower net charge-offs and a higher reserve release and we continued to operate within our targeted ranges for ROA, ROE and efficiency.", "Let me now highlight these key drivers in more detail. On Page 3, we highlight the year-over-year growth John emphasized in his remarks including revenue, loans, deposits and EPS as well as improving credit.", "Turning to Page 4, we continued to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet which has positioned us well to take advantage of growth opportunities and to prudently deploy liquidity. Short-term investments and FED funds sold were down $59.1 billion from the first quarter reflecting loan growth, security purchases and lower deposit balances driven by seasonality in our consumer businesses and repricing in certain wholesale businesses. ", "Our securities portfolio grew $16 billion from the first quarter. We purchased approximately $36 billion in securities primarily agency MBS, US treasuries and municipal securities which were partially offset by maturities, amortization and sales.", "Turning to the income statement on Page 5, it\u2019s important to note that the linked quarter decline in earnings was driven by the $359 million discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. Our pre-tax earnings increased $386 million or 5% from the first quarter, demonstrating the underlying momentum we had across our businesses. ", "Revenue increased $40 million from first quarter with strong growth in net interest income, up $284 million reflecting growth in earning assets. We had linked quarter growth and fee income in most of our customer-facing businesses including deposit service charges, trust and investment fees, card fees, merchant processing, commercial real estate brokerage, mortgage and insurance. ", "However, non-interest income declined $244 million from first quarter due to lower market-sensitive revenue and lower other income driven by the accounting impact related to our debt hedges. ", "Expenses declined, despite an increase in operating losses related to litigation accruals and we generated positive operating leverage. As shown on Page 6, we continued to have strong loan growth in the second quarter, our 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core loan portfolio grew by $68.5 billion, or 9% from a year ago and was up $29.5 billion from first quarter.", "Our growth was broad based which I\u2019ll highlight on the next slide and included $11.5 billion from the GE Capital loan purchase and financing transaction. This transaction is an excellent example of how the combination of our balance sheet strengths, the expertise of our team members and our relationship focus positions us to capture opportunities for growth. 67% of this portfolio is US-based with the remainder of the portfolio predominantly in the United Kingdom and Canada, which are active lending markets for us.", "The loans we purchased were to over 145 different customers while we had existing relationships with many of these customers, the transaction has provided us with a meaningful number of new relationships which we believe will lead to additional opportunities for new business. It\u2019s also important to note that we didn\u2019t acquire these loans until late in the quarter, so while it increased ending loan balances, most of the benefit to average loans and to net interest income will be reflected in the third quarter.", "On Page 7, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $36.6 billion or 15% from a year ago, the GE Capital transaction drove $4.2 billion of this growth primarily from the financing to Blackstone Mortgage Trust. The rest of the growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double-digit year-over-year growth in asset-backed finance, equipment finance, corporate banking and government and institutional banking. ", "Commercial real estate loans grew $10.2 billion or 8% from a year ago and included $7.3 billion from the GE Capital transaction. Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $15 billion or 7% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high-quality non-conforming mortgages.", "Credit card balances were up $3.9 billion or 14% from a year ago, benefiting from strong new account growth and the Dillard\u2019s portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year. ", "Auto loans were up $3.7 billion or 7% from last year. New originations reflected the strong auto market and were up 5% from a year ago and up 15% from first quarter benefiting from seasonality. ", "As highlighted on Page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the second quarter, up $83.8 billion from a year ago and up $10.5 billion from first quarter. Our average deposit cost declined 8 basis points, down 2 basis points from a year ago. The decline in ending balances reflected the seasonal impact to consumer balances due to income tax payments and repricing in certain wholesale businesses primarily global financial institutions. ", "We continued to successfully grow our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5.6% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5.3%. Our primary customers have more products with us and are more than twice as profitable as non-primary customers. ", "Page 9 highlights our revenue diversification in the balance between spread and fee income which has shifted slightly to more net-interest income as we benefited from strong earning asset growth. Our earning asset mix results and diversified \u2013 results and diversified sources of interest income, the drivers of our fee generation are also diverse and vary based on interest rate and economic conditions, for example, market-sensitive revenue which includes trading gains from our \u2013 trading and gains from our debt and equity investments declined 21% from first quarter, market-sensitive revenue was 8% of our fee income in the second quarter, down from 11% in the first quarter, however, many of our other customer-facing businesses generated higher fee income. ", "We grew net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by %524 million or 5% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in average earning assets, up 11% from a year ago. The $312 million increase in net interest income from first quarter reflected growth in earning assets and one extra day in the quarter. ", "Net interest income also benefited from increased income from variable sources, lower deposit cost and higher income from interest rate swaps used to convert a portion of our floating rate commercial loans to fixed rate as we continue to add duration to our balance sheet. ", "The net interest margin increased 2 basis points from the first quarter. This is the first linked quarter increase in the NIM since the first quarter of 2012. The increase this quarter was driven by balance sheet repricing and growth including growth in investments and loans and lower deposit cost which benefited the margin by 4 basis points. ", "Higher variable income from increased loan fees, semi-annual preferred dividends and PCR recoveries contributed 1 basis point to the margin, customer-driven deposit growth reduced the margin by 3 basis points but had minimal impact to net interest income. Our balance sheet remains asset-sensitive and we are positioned to benefit from higher rates.", "However, we believe we can grow net interest income in 2015, compared with 2014 even if rates remain low. ", "Total non-interest income declined $244 million from first quarter, driven by lower market-sensitive revenue and lower other non-interest income. The other non-interest income category was down $426 million in the second quarter driven by the accounting impact of interest rate and currency hedges associated with our long-term debt. ", "We are required to measure the hedge effectiveness quarterly and while the net impact is expected to be zero over the term, quarterly interest rate and currency volatility can cause this line item to vary from quarter-to-quarter. It\u2019s important to note that while total non-interest income declined, if you exclude market-sensitive revenue and other income, we had strong diversified fee growth across our other fee categories demonstrating growth from doing more business with our customers. ", "In fact, second quarter was the strongest quarter over the past five quarters for brokerage, trust and investment management, card, merchant processing, insurance and mortgage origination. Mortgage banking revenue increased up $158 million from the first quarter on higher origination volume, up $13 billion or 27%. ", "Second quarter had the highest level of mortgage production since the third quarter of 2013, 54% of originations before purchases up 45% in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a $38 billion application pipeline, up $8 billion from a year ago and down $6 billion from first quarter. ", "Based on the current rate environment, the level of our pipeline and the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, we currently expect originations in the third quarter to be lower than the second quarter. Our gain on sale ratio was 188 basis points in the second quarter and we currently expect the third quarter ratio to remain within the range of the past five quarters between 140 and 210 basis points. ", "As shown on Page 12, expenses were down $38 million from the first quarter, the decline was primarily due to lower employee benefits expense which was seasonally elevated in the first quarter. Operating losses were $521 million in the second quarter, up $226 million from the first quarter reflecting higher litigation accruals for various legal matters.", "While we continue to invest in our businesses reflected in higher professional services and advertising expenses in the second quarter, we remained focused on operating efficiently as indicated by our efficiency ratio improving to 58.5%. We expect the efficiency ratio for the full year 2015 to remain within our targeted range of 55% to 59%.", "Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.4 billion in the second quarter, down 8% from first quarter which included the discrete tax benefit. One of the drivers of our long-term growth is our ability to grow retail bank households. Year-to-date through May, we\u2019ve had the strongest household growth in four years. This strong growth reflects our success in attracting new customers to Wells Fargo as well as the benefit of better retention of our existing households as we remain focused on meeting their financial needs.", "This focus has also resulted in an increase in total products held by our customers. For example, we\u2019ve been successfully growing the penetration rate of credit cards to our retail bank households which has grown to 42.6% in the second quarter, up from 39% a year ago and 34.9% two years ago.", "Credit card purchase volume was up 15% from a year ago reflecting an increase in new accounts; debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago benefiting from the strong growth in primary checking account customers and increased usage among existing customers. ", "Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter, up 3% from a year ago and 12% from first quarter. Wholesale banking continued to have strong loan and deposit growth. Average loans grew 12% from a year ago with broad based growth across most wholesale businesses. ", "This growth in average loans did not fully reflect the benefit of the GE Capital transaction reported late in the quarter. Average core deposits grew 14% from a year ago and flat linked quarter reflecting pricing actions we took in the second quarter to reduce deposit costs. ", "The strong loan and deposit growth helps grow revenue by 2% from a year ago. Treasury and management revenue grew 10% reflecting new product sales and repricing. Second quarter revenue also benefited from higher equity gains from the sale of certain equity fund investments driven by the Volcker Rule. ", "Wells Brokerage and Retirement had another record quarter earning $602 million in the second quarter, up 11% from a year ago and up 7% from first quarter. WBR\u2019s pre-tax margin was 26% in the second quarter exceeding its long-term target of 25%.", "Revenue grew 5% from a year ago, driven by higher recurring sources of revenue. Net interest income increased 12% and asset-based fees were up 7%. Brokerage advisory assets grew $434 billion, up $25 billion or 6% from a year ago, primarily driven by net flows. ", "WBR\u2019s strong loan growth continued with eight consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Loan growth accelerated this quarter up 16% from a year ago, the strongest growth rate in over six years. Growth was broad based with strong client demand across a number of product offerings. ", "Turning to Page 16, credit quality in the second quarter improved. Our net charge-off rate declined to 30 basis points of average loans. Non-performing assets have declined for 11 consecutive quarters and were down $438 million from first quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $67 million from first quarter as higher energy non-accrual loans were offset by improvement in residential real estate as well as other categories. ", "The reserve release was $350 million in the second quarter. The increase from first quarter was driven by continued credit quality improvement, most notably, significant improvement in residential real estate. Our credit losses in our residential real estate portfolios declined 22% and non-accrual loans declined $388 million or 4% from first quarter.", "It\u2019s important to note that even small changes in the performance of our residential real estate portfolios tend to out way changes in other portfolios, given the size of our residential real estate portfolio was 36% of total loans. ", "We had an increase in non-performing loans in our energy portfolio. Oil and gas loans are only 2% of our total loan portfolio and balances in this portfolio declined by approximately $700 million from first quarter reflecting pay downs. ", "Our energy team completed their spring re-determination process during the second quarter and as expected, the drop in energy prices did impact the cash flow and collateral values of a number of our borrowers leading to downward portfolio migration. The deterioration in this portfolio is reflected in our allowance for credit losses and we will continue to monitor the energy portfolio.", "Finally when considering our allowance, it\u2019s important to note that the loans we acquired from GE Capital were accounted for under purchase accounting under GAAP and reflected a lifetime credit loss adjustment and therefore did not require additional loan loss reserves typically associated with commercial loan growth. ", "Turning to Page 17, our capital levels remains strong with our estimated common equity tier-1 ratio under Basel-3 fully phased in at 10.5% in the second quarter. We returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and net share repurchases. Our common shares outstanding declined by 17.7 million shares in the second quarter reflecting 36.3 million shares repurchased and 18.6 million shares issued. ", "We expect to reduce our common shares outstanding through share repurchases throughout the remainder of the year. Our dividend payout ratio increased to 36% in the second quarter, as we increased the quarterly dividend rate on our common stock by 7%. ", "Our net payout ratio in the second quarter was 54%. The decline in our net payout ratio reflected our strong asset and RWA growth as our first call for capital is for providing credit to our customers. However we remained committed to returning capital to our shareholders and we expect our net payout ratio to be within our targeted range of 55% to 75% for the full year.", "In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong loan and deposit growth and momentum in non-interest income across many of our customer-facing businesses. Our strong liquidity position and capital levels position us well to serve our existing customers while growing our customer base organically and through acquisition. ", "The improvement in credit quality demonstrated our continued focus on risk management. While the current interest rate environment remains uncertain, we are actively managing our expenses while focusing on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs to generate growth. ", "We will now be happy to answer your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Ken Usdin ", "Thanks, good morning. ", "John Stumpf", "Good morning. ", "Ken Usdin ", "John, I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more on your confidence about the economic environment versus the commentary about the competition out there. So we know you guys are going to get a great benefit looking ahead from the averaging of the GE. So on one, could you just kind of flush out the pockets of loan growth that you continue to expect and then also, do you anticipate being able to at least be in a pole position to get some more of those GE assets? Thanks.", "John Stumpf", "So, there are variety of loan categories that deserves to be mentioned individually, but you know we are aggressively growing the card business with our existing deposit customers and percentage gains there will probably continue to be very strong. Autos in spite of the heat in that market and our public posture of wanting to maintain our credit discipline still are providing a big opportunity because so many cars are being sold. So and that\u2019s a continued opportunity. Still a lot going on in commercial real estate and as you mentioned the GE Capital loans helped us late in the third quarter there. Jumbo loans on the residential side have been growing on the balance sheet at the same strong pace for a long time and we continue to \u2013 we expect to see that there. Across the C&I range, we mentioned several of the businesses that have slightly independent but all attractive growth prospects. The utilization of lines across the variety of corporate and commercial loan categories is still in the, call it mid to low 30s. So there is room for that improvement and we keep gathering new customers in those businesses as well. So, it\u2019s really is coming from everywhere at attractive basis. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, Ken, there is a fair amount of capacity to carry more debt by medium size companies, small companies and consumers. Rates are very favorable and most Americans businesses and consumers have de-risked and deleveraged their balance sheet. So there are opportunities and we are very active on main street and on the back 40 working with the customers. So, we love this opportunity to do the GE thing, but organic relative still the main part the way we grow. ", "John Stumpf", "And with respect what there still might be to do with GE, there have been some portfolio sales that have been announced there since the one that we worked on. We are working as closely as we can with them. They are a great relationship of ours. There are our businesses that they are trying to dispose of that fit neatly with our expertise. Some things were going to be very competitive with and some because we are not expert in them will be less so. But we are working hard. We hope that that turns incremental opportunity to do more of what we\u2019ve done on the commercial real estate side and we\u2019ll be hearing about that in the coming months as their processes unfold. ", "Ken Usdin ", "Okay, great. And I have \u2013 just to follow-up on the energy portfolio shrinkage, you spoke about the $700 million decline, I am sure that we\u2019ll have the questions about the NPA growth. Could you talk about just what you are seeing in the energy side? Is that active? Like push outs by you guys, is it the equitization coming in and taking out credits? Can you just talk about like how that portfolio behavior is acting and how that influences your provisioning decisions? ", "John Stumpf", "Sure, so, I would describe the reduction in the principal balance as borrowers taking their balances down and just to conform with their borrowing base reductions and as I mentioned that was about $700 million of reduction in the second quarter. There was a lot of capital being raised in the first quarter; capital markets activity was very brisk in the first quarter. A little bit slower in the second quarter and a lot of that was equity coming in to stabilize balance sheets. It feels like that slow down just a little bit as people process what happened in the first quarter. So we don\u2019t anticipate loan balances or new loan activity to be terribly brisk in terms of leading to higher outstandings at Wells Fargo in the second half of the year. But the market is acting very rationally. The market is acting very quickly. The opportunists are arriving at the door and trying to work things out, create business combinations and take advantage of the situation to resolve it. So, things are happening frankly a little bit faster than we might have anticipated sitting here six or eight months ago. ", "Ken Usdin ", "Thanks, John. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joe Morford ", "Good morning everyone. ", "John Stumpf", "Hello, Joe. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Hey, Joe.", "Joe Morford ", "I guess just a follow-up on the credit trends within the energy portfolio. With the borrowing base re-determinations finalized, I mean, you touched on this, but how is performance tracked relative to initial expectations and how much of the increase in the related non-performing loans stems from that as opposed to the shared national credit exam? ", "John Stumpf", "Well, it\u2019s a combination of both and it\u2019s tough to call out specifically what the regulators might have independently wanted that we wouldn\u2019t have agreed to or gotten to on our own. I mean, the outcome is what it is and if we had about a $400 million increase to non-performing assets in energy for the quarter, which feels like it makes sense. And to the extent that some of those were very conservative estimations of NPA status I think and that will be recaptured in the back-end of the process when those loans get worked out which is fine. We had very nominal losses in the quarter and we\u2019ll go into a fall re-determination for E&P companies as well and we\u2019ll measure the performance of the midstream and services companies at the same time. We feel great about where our allowance is right now as you may recall they had an impact on our first quarter number even though that was pre re-determination and has an impact again on the second quarter number and who knows as the third and fourth quarter roll through, I am sure that there will be more loans that are at issue. The whole portfolio amounts to 2% of our loan portfolio, we feel very well reserved for where we are. We\u2019ve got the best team in energy banking and our credit folks working through the portfolio. So, it\u2019s - the impact here is relatively immaterial to Wells Fargo. And we as we called out in our comment, especially in a quarter like Q2, minor changes in our residential real estate portfolio have a tendency to dwarf whatever is going on in energy because 36% of the loan portfolio is in single-family real estate and 2% is in energy. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Joe, I would offer this, since I\u2019ve been on a long time, I think this is my third or fourth cycle I remember doing workouts in this business in the early 80s. This one is different in that \u2013 the energy participants whether they be on the E&P side or midstream, whatever it is, I am more conservative. They tend to be better capitalized, be rapid, more quickly through reducing their CapEx budgets, some case reducing dividends and some of the real stretchy stuff was done outside of our industry if you will. So, that mean that all situations are going to workout, but, they wouldn\u2019t \u2013 and reacted much more quickly than I have seen in the past cycles. ", "Joe Morford ", "That\u2019s very helpful. Big color. I guess, have you quantified what you have in terms of dedicated reserves against the energy portfolio and as you point out, given that, things like single-family is such a bigger part of the overall loan portfolio and what\u2019s your broader outlook for the provision and the possibility of any future reserve releases?", "John Stumpf", "So, we are bumping along here at 30 basis points of annualized net losses on the total loan portfolio and as we called out in the past, we shouldn\u2019t expect releases in any given quarter because it\u2019s going to \u2013 the calculation heats quarter of the allowance is going to include the observed portfolio of the portfolio is going to include general economic conditions is going to include where the growth is coming from in the mix in the portfolio. So, I would not model in release of this magnitude going forward and of course, as we\u2019ve said, we keep building our loan portfolio, you\u2019d expect to see builds often \u2013 things being equal. Separately, we also called out in the case of GE, if we are growing our loan portfolio by acquiring loans, and we invoke purchase accounting, then that\u2019s a complicating factor and whether the allowance is growing or not because the mark on the loans reflects the lifetime credit adjustment. So that\u2019s a little complicated. But \u2013 so, and for our own internal purposes, of course there is an allocable component of the allowance that reflects what we think a loss \u2013 the inherent loss content is in the energy portfolio and that will grow or shrink depending on how the portfolio performs. And as I said, I would assume that the next couple of quarters how much better than the last quarter in terms of we are still resolving these issues, some of them are just coming to life for certain borrowers but it\u2019s a very contained portion of our loan portfolio and the aggregate impact should not be material for Wells Fargo. ", "Joe Morford ", "Understand. Thanks so much. ", "John Stumpf", "You bet. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Erika Najarian ", "Hi, good morning. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Good morning, Erika.", "Erika Najarian ", "Just wanted to take a step back, as we enter potentially a rising rate environment in the second half of the year fingers crossed, one of your peers they meant, mentioned, anticipating a significantly more competitive environment for retail deposits given the regulators have essentially said, there are good deposits and bad deposits this time around. And secondarily, they also mentioned entering new markets for the first time and de novoing. I guess, the first question is, how should we expect Wells Fargo\u2019s repricing to progress actually rise on the short-end, secondarily, given the impressive footprint that you\u2019ve built, how would you defend that market sharing footprint against those that are aggressively trying to grow retail deposits, particularly for regulatory purposes? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Erika, let me start with that. It\u2019s a great question and not all retail deposits are credit equal. You know our focus here has been on relationships and we think relationships on the consumer side start with a consumer checking account. In fact, I don\u2019t have this exactly but I think it\u2019s 86% of our retail customers have a checking account with us it\u2019s their primary account they live out of that. And if you look at certificates and deposit, it\u2019s less than $35 billion here. So it\u2019s a couple percent of ours. So that\u2019s a very different deposit make up and like other companies in our industry, we had a lot of experience in rates backing up. And the speed of the backup matters where it starts from, a move from 300% to 400% is different from a move from nothing to 1%. And also where you employ those more expensive deposits, will you find offsetting earning assets to employ those. And, I recall the last time we went through this, we had very aggressive deposit competitors who are using those deposits to fund businesses acquired to sell models in the real estate business for example. So it was used. So, we\u2019ve been through a lot of different things. We\u2019ve modeled this. If I were a bettering person, I would bet that we\u2019ll probably be favorable to our model suggest early in the backup, but I think one of the great under valued parts of our business today is the quality of our deposit franchise and you\u2019ll see that in the backup. ", "John Stumpf", "And to the point of entering new markets, well, we adjust our store footprint meaningfully every year by opening and closing stores where we see fit, I think as Carrie Tolstedt has described in our last Investor Day, we believe that we need a certain amount of scale in any urban market before we can really make a difference and we are in most of the markets that we like to be in, and of course we are not going to get there through acquisitions. So, it would seem unusual for us to commit to building, for example, hundreds and hundreds of stores in a new major urban center that we are not already a part of. So, I wouldn\u2019t think about that as part of our next stage plan. ", "Erika Najarian ", "Got it and just a follow-up on some of the comments, John, thank you for telling us how you accounted for the GE purchase. How should we think about your capital progress relative to further, or incremental loan purchases? As I think about the past three quarters your CET1 ratio has been fairly stable at about 10.5%. If you are using purchase accounting for larger loan purchases, of course that would impact CET1 and I guess I'm wondering sort of what your thoughts on the \u2013 you know whether you may account for purchases differently going forward, as you consider the CET1 progress particularly in light - in terms of some commentary, you've heard from regulators recently about including CET1 surcharges in the CCAR test? ", "John Stumpf", "Sure, well, so the first call on our capital is for our customers, including prospective customers if we were going to add either an originator or acquirer portfolios of loans. I don\u2019t think there is any accounting theory out there that would allow us to add loans without impacting common equity tier-1. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s risk-weighted assets are what is for. So if we had a bigger opportunity to grow RWA faster and the way that we thought was very attractive for shareholders, then we would probably do that and if we need to do, for example, curtail distributions and for some period of time in order to retain the capital to create that outcome, then we would probably do that. As we\u2019ve told people in our capital planning process and describing it, we want to keep as much capital as it\u2019s appropriate and necessary to grow the business and that\u2019s primarily by growing RWA and we want to distribute everything beyond that and which is about where we\u2019ve been operating. So if there were a bigger RWA opportunity, we would measure where we were starting from, we would understand what sort of capital generation was going on at that time and it\u2019s possible, we would end up retaining a little bit more in order to maintain satisfactory levels while growing assets. ", "Erika Najarian ", "Got it. So I am clear on the takeaway. Any portfolio purchases from has to be life of loan accounting in terms of the losses?", "John Stumpf", "Yes.", "Erika Najarian ", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up to the GE portfolio, you did add this quarter you mentioned that we need to consider the average balance impact. Are there any considerations on the average yield impact, as we think about the third quarter?", "John Stumpf", "For average yield of the loan portfolio?", "Erika Najarian ", "Yes, in terms of\u2026 ", "John Stumpf", "Yes, the GE loans fit right into the averages that we already had. So it\u2019s really more balanced.", "Erika Najarian ", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead. ", "Bill Carcache ", "Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on margins. Part of the NIM compression that we have been seeing for so long has obviously been in part due to all the excess liquidity that's been getting parked at the FED as deposit growth has significantly outpaced loan growth really at a system-wide level. But today, we saw one of your competitors reported a decrease in deposits both sequentially and year-over-year while still putting up pretty solid loan growth, and you guys also saw your loan growth outpaced your deposit growth this quarter. So, I guess the question is, do you think we're at an inflection point where we'll no longer see deposit growth continue to exceed loan growth and if so, does that suggest that that we should begin to see some continued improvement in NIMs going forward?", "John Stumpf", "Let me take the deposit side first and then John can do that. If you \u2013 one quarter does not make summer as one sparrow if you will, if you look at the last year, we grew average deposits b y almost $84 billion and our core loan portfolio grew $60 some billion, if you take our overall loan portfolio, it was in the $40 billion to $50 billion. So we actually outgrew deposits by some $20 billion or $30 billion on an annual basis. The first quarter is always kind of a funny quarter when you compare to the second quarter or second quarter to the first quarter because of the tax impact, because we have such a large retail deposit base. So, we look back, I think to 1945, I think all but one year, we grew deposit. So, whether we can outgrow or not outgrow, we sure like our opportunities continuing on the deposit side, because after all we are growing net new consumer checking accounts primary by 5.6% and on small business we are growing by 5.3% or 4%. These are the strongest numbers I\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years in my history at the company. So these are very, very strong acquisition numbers.", "John Shrewsberry", "So, one thing I have to mention about the industry and I am sure you are thinking about this. But, we are in a slightly different position but there are some other larger banks that are discouraging deposits because of the adverse impact on leverage ratio, the adverse impact on the GSIB buffer calculations, et cetera and people have been vocal about getting out there and trying to move those deposits out of their banks to take their numbers down and those are in the same deposit numbers that you are referring to. So, it\u2019s a little bit complicated I think, bank-by-bank as you are looking at it. Ours is as John described. And we are also not shrinking our store count and we have found that, in our omni channel distribution, where you have stores or locations ATMs, phones, online and mobile, it\u2019s the magic of all those working together. And that\u2019s a very strong compelling value proposition for our customers. ", "John Stumpf", "At both attracting retaining deposits and then back to Erika\u2019s question about what happens in a backup, people who want to move away from Wells Fargo are moving away from that value proposition that\u2019s provided to them basically for free in exchange for having their relationship at Wells Fargo.", "Bill Carcache ", "Thank you. If I may, as a follow-up, the amount of liquidity that you are holding at the said FED, you mentioned fell this quarter from an all-time high of $291 billion, I believe last quarter. Is it reasonable to expect that to continue to fall from here as you redeploy more of that into higher-yielding loans and securities? And taking LCR into consideration and the constraints there, can you give us a sense for where we could see those balances go?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, it depends on what\u2019s happening on other fronts including ongoing deposit growth. But, I wouldn\u2019t forecast it as coming down, but as we\u2019ve described before, there is probably tens of billions of dollars of room from where we are today to where that balance might go before we started to having any difficult discussions about LCR. So there is plenty of room from where we are today.", "Bill Carcache ", "Okay, thank you for taking my questions. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Paul Miller ", "Yes, thank you very much. Talking a bit about the mortgage side, when we saw rates go up, but I think a lot of \u2013 when the volumes have held in very strong, some of that I think is the \u2013 as the refi pipeline coming out of first quarter, but - can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the purchase market world? Is it really starting to make a comeback?", "John Shrewsberry", "So, yes, it was a strong quarter and I mean, strongest in a while, it doesn\u2019t reflect the pre-crisis types of activity at this point. It\u2019s strong in a handful of individual markets, California, New York, Southern Florida, Denver or particular markets where we\u2019ve seen a lot of strength. First time home buyers are a little bit stronger at about 30% of home purchases. We saw that our purchases as a percentage of originations were 54% this quarter versus 45 the prior quarter as you mentioned, the second quarter had a lot of refis closing in it that were locked in the first quarter when rates were very low. So, when we think about new application volume in the second quarter, my guess is, as that flows through in Q3 that number will be even higher. All things being equal, because rates did backup meaningfully in the quarter. So, the business is good. There is plenty of credit available. We are obviously as enthusiastic and committed to it as we\u2019ve ever been. Margins have been holding in there nicely and the pipeline looks quite good actually.", "Paul Miller ", "And then, go ahead.", "John Shrewsberry", "One last thing I\u2019d add is that, all of that is a reflection of continued affordability while home prices have moved, there is still affordable, while rates have moved they are still affordable. So, that\u2019s helping a lot and we\u2019ve had an improving jobs market which brings more people into eligibility for a purchase or a refinancing.", "Paul Miller ", "And then you saw the \u2013 I mean, everybody saw the [Indiscernible] has been pushed back another three months. Do you see any impact on the mortgage market or on how you view the mortgage market with the new regulations with [Indiscernible]", "John Shrewsberry", "No, except - one thing I would say is we were ready to go with the original deadline. But, no impact.", "Paul Miller ", "Okay. Thank you very much gentlemen. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "John McDonald ", "Hi, thank you. Just a question, John, on the efficiency ratio. You\u2019re at the high end of your range last couple of quarters. Do you see opportunities to drive down the efficiency ratio prior to rates going up or is it more likely to stay still at the upper-end of the range until we see interest rates move higher?", "John Shrewsberry", "I think it's going to stay in the upper part of the range until revenue moves higher, which will probably happen as a result of - or at least most meaningfully over a short period of time because of rates moving higher. We are spending the money that we think we need to spend to run a great business today and manage risk, as well as invest in the future around things that customers want, things that we need to be a well run, resilient, compliant, risk managed, technologically savvy firm, and that gets us to 58 plus or minus percent, which I would remind you is a very good number for a bank of our size. But, yes, there is no near-term path or project to try and drive ourselves down in the range. We are trying to operate where we have been, accomplish all the things that we need to accomplish and deal with the reality that we are in a below 3% GDP growth environment, in a zero rate environment, neither of which is as hospitable as some other environments might be for revenue growth in banking.", "John Stumpf ", "And, John the \u2013 but we're always, as you know us and you know us well, we continue to look for opportunities to simplify the business, streamline the work we do so we can repurpose those dollars into things that are important to customers, important to risk management, other things here. So the development that we are doing and image capture in our branches or our stores, the different things that we invest in payments, cyber and all the other things that we do, we are self-funding through being very thoughtful about where we spend our money.", "John McDonald ", "Thank you. And one other question, guys, could you comment on the market and what it's like for additional portfolio purchases? I assume it's very competitive, obviously, GE has got some other assets out for sale. And just in general, nothing specific but more general, what are the pros and cons when you look at portfolios to purchase and kind of how do you feel like the markets like for that?", "John Shrewsberry", "So, it's very competitive, and I think that this current set of assets that's being offered for sale is being viewed by some people as the biggest opportunity in a long time. Some of the assets or platforms are suitable for non-depository institutions and I would say that non-banks interested in creating a lending platform would appear to be willing to pay a bigger premium than people who have an existing platform and are looking to add customers and assets to it. All of these do require financing in one form or another. So that can be either a limiting factor or for the easier to finance assets, I guess, that can be a benefit for people who don't have deposit bases in order to bid. But very competitive, it\u2019s how I would describe it.", "John McDonald ", "Okay. Thank you.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ", "Betsy Graseck ", "Questions, one on other income and one on the wealth business. You called out on other income that you had a $426 million impact from the debt hedges. I just wanted to make sure I understood what that was driven by - I know you indicated rate moves. Just want to make sure I understand is that the long-end of the curve. And does it have any relation to the fair value hedges that you put in the 10-Q, the $173 million. So, wanted to make sure understand how that works.", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure, so for some of the debt that we issue, we swap it back to dollars and swap it back to LIBOR and so we've got perfect cash flow hedges on where we choose to do that. The accounting for that requires the liability on the one hand and the hedge on the other to be discounted using different discount rates and so over the life of both instruments, there can be some noise in the P&L. We've had a benefit in the past and this time we had a negative and it was driven by a few things, but mostly by the major movements in longer-term swap rates in dollar, Sterling and LIBOR during the quarter. And the net impact from the quarter is, as it was described in the materials. So I\u2019d just point out, this is sort of a \u2013 call that\u2019s a timing difference, an accounting difference, it nets back to zero over the life of the liability. So we don't think of it as a real economic issue, but it creates noise in the other non-interest income line item. ", "Betsy Graseck ", "Okay. So the net was $426 million, not the $426 million plus the $173 million from the fair value hedges in the 10-Q?", "John Shrewsberry", "Correct.", "Betsy Graseck ", "Okay. Okay, separately on wealth. I've been just reading some articles recently that talked about how - and you can tell me this is correct or not, but how the focus is not really on increasing the number of FAs and obviously we see flat FAs in the release you put out today, but more on the technology and the investment spend there. Is that accurate, number one and number two, could you explain how you are looking to advance the technology platforms that you got in this business?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. So, I wouldn't say that it's an express strategy to not increase the number of FAs. I don't think that that's necessarily the primary driver of value creation in the long-term for David Carroll's business. You may see that differently, John. The point on technology is a good one. There are a number of initiatives underway in that business to modernize and to create service capability to attract new investors and to better serve the investors that we have. And that turns up in the \u2013 sort of primary systems that our financial advisors use to interact with our customers. It will turn up in our mobile and online offerings that allow people to do more for themselves and at some point, it could even include service or capability that competes with some of the sort of the robo advisory people out there today who rely primarily on technology to construct portfolios and make offerings to customers. All of those things are opportunities for us to make the business even stronger and more relevant going forward on top of what we feel is very good performance over the last few years.", "John Stumpf", "Yes, and Betsy we see this really is one of the most attractive growth opportunities in the company. If you think of how we are positioned as a broadly diversified company serving customers, one in three Americans, one way or another, Americans are living longer. They are probably convinced you have to be more reliant on their own resources for the retirement. And we have 10% to 11% of the deposits in the country and yet, only a fraction of that as far as where we manage well. So this is a big opportunity and investments in people and systems and capabilities, but that should in no way, the growth -- we've already done great work. David Carroll and his team have done incredible. I mean, think how many companies out there would love to have the way we monetize and the way everybody else does $602 million of after-tax earnings for a quarter, 26% margins, these are very, very good numbers.", "Betsy Graseck ", "Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mike Mayo ", "Hi, a factual question. What was the amount of your debt hedge loss in the second quarter? You mentioned that other income is down $426 million, was that the amount of the debt hedge loss or is it different?", "John Shrewsberry", "It was - we had a $127 million gain in the first quarter and $193 million loss in the second quarter. And again, I just want to describe that as the accounting treatment for the hedging program that we have there. But, so, think of this \u2013 that the delta between Q1 and Q2 as what creates the more outsized numbers.", "Mike Mayo ", "So normal would just be zero?", "John Stumpf ", "No, normal would be around zero. You\u2019d expect it to be zero over its life. Sometimes it's a little positive sometimes it's a little negative. And it's driven by swap rates and currency movements in the currencies where we issue.", "Mike Mayo ", "All right. The more important question from me, you mentioned repricing in wholesale businesses and at \u2013 what are you doing there as it relates to your market-sensitive revenues?", "John Stumpf ", "What we repriced in wholesale is deposits and for a variety of customers, the ones who seem to have acted most strongly in the deposit area were FIs, which for all the reasons you could imagine how relatively low value liquidity deposits and so, we have \u2013 we\u2019ve been paying less for those deposits or in some cases, and in some jurisdictions, have been charging a little bit for those deposits and that's what we were referring to.", "Mike Mayo ", "What are you seeing in pricing in your market-sensitive businesses more generally? And is that one reason why your \u2013 this is the lowest trading quarter you've had since the third quarter of 2011 and we'll certainly take the other revenues in lieu of trading. But, are you pricing some of those activities away? Is it simply the markets weaker? What's going on there? But especially as it relates to potential repricing or the competitive environment?", "John Stumpf ", "Yes, you know, it's not as a result of Wells Fargo specific pricing strategies. It's just the chips falling where they did in terms of flows, volumes and other activity in the business. And as you know, in our trading business, we have what you are thinking of which is market-making and customer accommodation activity but we also have the impact of our own deferred comp program, et cetera, which makes that line a little bit noisy. But it's not as a result of any conscious business decision to price things differently to do any more of this or less of that it's just where the quarter fell.", "Mike Mayo ", "And then lastly, and so is pricing getting better, worse and if so, what areas within the market-sensitive areas?", "John Shrewsberry", "I wouldn't say that pricing is getting any better. You would think that pricing might be getting better in areas where other banks are pulling back from providing financing or liquidity to customers, which is part of the discussion around how some of the bigger trading-oriented banks have been providing repo, providing securities finance, et cetera, and have limited their appetites. But prices haven't gone up that much. I think capacity has come out and people have had to figure out how to deal with that. So, at the moment, it's still very - it's as competitive as it ever was and the pricing reflects that, but not because of conscious strategies.", "Mike Mayo ", "All right, thank you.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.", "Eric Wasserstrom ", "Thanks very much. I just had one question to clarify the loan growth expectations. And if I look at the core loan growth, it's growing about excluding the GE transaction and run-off, it's growing at about almost four times nominal GDP, which would be at the higher end of the historical norm. So, I just want to make sure I understand, John, your comments about expectations of maybe some incremental leverage across both commercial and consumer. But I wonder to what extent it may in fact that may already be occurring and the GDP number will move to reflect that rather than an acceleration in loan growth?", "John Shrewsberry", "That's good question. We don't model loan growth necessarily as a reflection of prior quarter GDP. But it's an interesting relationship. I think our point is that the areas where we've been experiencing organic loan growth all are still very active. We are still very competitive. We are getting more than our fair share in most of those categories. We've got further to run in car and I\u2019d say than other people because we are starting from a smaller base. And then in some of our material businesses, we've got customers who have been holding back on their borrowing capacity. So in the corporate - but in the commercial space in particular where we are a very big player, our customers are still very cash-heavy, which is reflected in our deposits and have maintained very low leverage profile. So that if they got a little bit more enthusiasm around M&A, around organic growth or building a new plant, et cetera, expanding their businesses, they have lots of debt capacity to do that, and we\u2019d expect to see some of that in line utilization or demand for funded assets. But, the real takeaway is that we're very well positioned in all of our key lending markets and competing well today. And in those areas where there might be incremental drivers of demand and we hope to benefit from it when it happens. And then, of course, we are working on a few strategic or inorganic activities as well.", "Eric Wasserstrom ", "Sure. Thank you for that, and just one clarification question. Did you indicate how much your legal accrual was for the period?", "John Shrewsberry", "We didn't. We\u2019ve indicated the size of operating losses in total. The amount of the change and the amount of the changes reflected \u2013 reflects increased litigation accruals, but we don't split that out from our other operating losses.", "Eric Wasserstrom ", "And are those legal accruals for issues related disclosed in the 10-K or for new ones?", "John Shrewsberry", "It's for a variety of matters, most of which you would already be familiar with.", "Eric Wasserstrom ", "Okay, all right. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Matt O'Connor ", "Good morning. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Hey, Matt. Good morning..", "Matt O'Connor ", "I know there's been some talk about working on becoming more efficient, just kind of continuous improvement. But do you have some formal initiative underway? I guess there was an article in a regional paper a couple months ago and it mentioned something called E&E, or something along the lines of that?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, that's \u2013 as John was mentioning earlier, we are trying to repurpose our expense dollars to their highest value area. And so there is a collection of programs and ways of doing business, of thinking about how we spend our resources that are designed to do just that. So it's an internal, it's a relatively formal program. It's around some operational improvements. It's around some of our staff functional alignment. Some of our technology spend, et cetera, and it really is designed to make sure that where we are spending money and of course we spend a lot of it that we are putting it in the most impactful places.", "Matt O'Connor ", "Is it the kind of program where, if we don't get rates increasing and a stronger economy, then you can kind of redirect some of the savings more to the bottom-line versus investing in other areas?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, dollars are fungible, but as the way we are thinking about it is, we are directing those dollars toward places they are going to make a difference for customers which would drive revenue. And they could see bottom-line improvement as a result of that. But as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, it's not really designed to drive us down in the efficiency ratio or to drive total dollars of expense down. All things being equal, it's designed to make sure that we are spending the money that we are spending in the most impactful place.", "Matt O'Connor ", "Okay. And then just separately on the net interest margin, as we think about the trajectory from here, assuming rates don't increase, what should the path of the NIM be?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, it's going to depend on what happens with deposits versus loan and other earning asset growth primarily. So, if we continue along the path that we are on right now, then you would think that it would probably stay in or about this range. There is not much else, deposit pricing is quite efficient here at 8 basis points. So, as we get more invested, as we add more loans and if we convert cash to higher yielding assets then that should be an improvement. Over the course, if you fast forward it to few years, we'll probably be layering in more senior unsecured in connection with TLAC. That will probably have a negative impact, although relatively modest in the overall scheme of things. We still expect net interest income in 2015 to be higher than 2014, which is frankly, the most important thing, all things being equal and that's what we are driving toward.", "John Stumpf", "Let me just go back to the expensing just one more time so we are all on the same page. There is talk on this call, and of course, we listen to what the Chairwoman of the FED has to say about rates. But when we plan internally here, we don't consider rate increases as part of the ongoing justification for an investment in anything. So in other words, we don't \u2013 you would not hear a language like, I want to make this investment because when rates turnaround and go back up, then this justifies, this investment will be justified. We don't know what's going to happen to rates and if rates do increase, either long-term or the short-end or both that's a benefit to us. But, for the last five six years, you could have said the same thing and it didn't happen. So that's why there is a continual consideration here and pushing ourselves and our thinking to eliminate work that's no longer beneficial, taking out processes that don't add values and investing in places and things that do add value and make us more competitive, more nimble, more relative to the constituents that we serve.", "Matt O'Connor ", "Great. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari ", "Good morning. ", "John Stumpf", "Good morning.", "John Pancari ", "Just a couple quick areas I want to ask about. On the commercial loan yields, it looks like they were up pretty solidly 7% to 8%, or 7 to 8 bps or so for the quarter. Just want to see if we can get a little bit of color on what drove that?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure, so there is a handful of things. I mean it's the mix of the assets that we are adding to that portfolio from one period to the next, which reflects customer activity, customer demand, both in terms of what's rolling on and what's rolling off. Also, you are seeing in that calculation, the impact of having swapped portions of that portfolio from floating to fixed, because that impacts the yield. We've done that partially as the recognition that we think we are going to be in a lower long-term rate environment for a longer period of time than we might have previously thought. So, that impact is \u2013 runs through there as well, still asset-sensitive, but not waiting forever for rates to begin to move in that portfolio.", "John Pancari ", "Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then on the credit front, back to the energy thing, just real quick, any clarity on how much of that increase in the energy-related non-accruals were E&P versus oil service, and then separately, it sounds like some of this movement may have been related to the shared national credit exam. Was there anything non-energy that may have been - any takeaways out of the shared national credit exam that may have impacted your non-energy portfolio?", "John Shrewsberry", "So on the first question, like - remind me the first question again.", "John Pancari ", "Yes, just of the\u2026 ", "John Shrewsberry", "E&P, it was predominantly all E&P. The services credits have \u2013 first of all, they don't go through the exact same, there is no borrowing base re-determination to occur in services companies; it's more like any other corporate in terms of how they are reviewed. But the impact has not been felt there in quite the same way as it has with E&P companies. And then back to the shared national credit review, in terms of the negative outcomes or the suggested downgrades, it really was primarily an energy set of conclusions this time around.", "John Pancari ", "Okay, all right. And then lastly, the home equity portfolio, just one of you can give us an update there. As you are seeing some of the lines exit their draw periods, want to see how those credits have been performing and you're seeing any migration there.", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, we've been \u2013 as we've talked about, ahead of this end of draw expectation for sometime now, because it was pretty easy to schedule and we are going into a couple of years when those 10-year draw periods will be coming to a close from the heaviest periods of issuance right at the \u2013 prior to the turn of the cycle and, frankly, I\u2019d say, we are experiencing a better outcome than we originally imagined in part because of our \u2013 because of our - the focus that we've had, the team that we've had facing, the proactive work that we're emphasizing trying to get people refied into something that is suitable or more tolerable for them to repay. So, things are going well.", "John Stumpf", "And losses in that portfolio this quarter are in the 56 or 57 basis point range. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, very tolerable.", "John Stumpf", "Very tolerable.", "John Pancari ", "Okay, on that front, I mean, do you know how much \u2013 what percentage of your 2005 originations may have been refied already or worked down?", "John Shrewsberry", "I don't \u2013 right I don\u2019t at the - on this call, our real estate group certainly knows, because that's how that's been managed. So they'll know what they have left and what is gone already. But, when I'm focusing on when I say that there is a plan underway that's being executed that's working, of course for the ones that are still there and then have it refied out.", "John Pancari ", "Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my questions.", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.", "Marty Mosby ", "Thanks. I had a question on \u2013 you talked about the duration of the balance sheet and you are doing that through swaps and through investment portfolio purchases. Can you give us a feel for, half-a-year, six months, is it nine months and how far do you want to go in the duration of the portfolio or the overall balance sheet? So, how far are we along that process?", "John Shrewsberry", "So, when we use the term duration, we are using it in that context, but not to define a duration of the balance sheet, but really to think about using those tools, the investment portfolio and loan portfolios to impact our overall asset or liability sensitivity. And so the net conclusion of that is that, not terribly unlike where we were at our last Investor Day. We find ourselves still asset-sensitive. We mentioned a year ago, May that we thought that we were \u2013 we had probably 10 to 30 basis points worth of net sensitivity \u2013 net benefit from a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel movement in rates. Very stylized example. And we are less asset-sensitive. If we were at the mean then, we're at the lower-end of that range today we believe. It's probably a conservative estimate. We - that's how we generally calculate things. But by adding securities, by swapping floating rates to fixed, and other actions that have occurred in the growth of the business, we've made ourselves a little bit less asset-sensitive because of the belief that we could be in a lower rate environment for a longer period of time and we are earning today rather than maintaining all of that sensitivity for the future. We still have plenty of it and we'll develop more of it as time passes, but that's how I would answer that question.", "Marty Mosby ", "And would you see any more lengthening in the near-term, given the steepness of the yield curve now gives you an opportunity to kind of productively use that to your advantage?", "John Shrewsberry", "I would expect that we\u2019d continue to be adding securities to our securities portfolio, for sure.", "Marty Mosby ", "And then lastly, the mortgage banking pipeline was very strong going into the second quarter. It looks like the pull through was about as low as we've seen in the last year. I was just curious if there was any operational issue or anything that happened during the quarter? Was it just refis that never got closed? What was kind of the difference in the pull through for this particular quarter?", "John Shrewsberry", "There is nothing that I would point to. We -- the production occurred the way we would have expected it to. We ended with a relatively long \u2013 relatively large pipeline as well. So, nothing different there.", "Marty Mosby ", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Please go ahead. ", "Kevin Barker ", "Just a quick follow-up on the some of the mortgage banking results, you saw margins remain pretty strong compared to what you've had over historical basis and they were strong in the first quarter despite the decline in the primary/secondary spread. Now the front-half of the quarter looked a lot stronger than the second half of the quarter. Could you just give us some detail between the differences what you saw in maybe April and early May versus what you saw in the back half of the quarter?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, it's tough to be that precise about it although I'm sure there are people in Wells Fargo Home Mortgage who are thinking about it as granularly as the question that you are asking. Certainly, in the first quarter as rates rallied hard and that pipeline really, really grew, applications came in at an increased pace. The capacity constraints to deal with that both at Wells Fargo and in the industry are supportive of higher margins as people use their scarce capacity as beneficially as they can. So you'd expect, if that's a high point for things to slip a little bit from there. In terms of where they've gotten to and where they are now, we expect them to continue to be in that range. The full range, frankly is a pretty attractive place to be operating. And as long as we can stay higher in the range like we have, we\u2019ll be thrilled to that to happen. There is also, from one quarter to the next, the mix between what's happening in retail versus what's happening through others is going to influence our gain on sale and that might look different from one originator to another. I think that's an important consideration. But, I mean, frankly, I would look at it quarter-to-quarter and then seasonally adjust it to think about what the steady-state is. But the last thing I'd say is that we are - again, we're pretty happy with where things have remained, given how competitive that market is, given how much capacity there is and we're happy to be operating here.", "John Stumpf", "Yes, I think, just to support John's comment, I remember when gain on sales - years ago were 40, 50, 60 basis points. So the pricing discipline, even with the capacity and the size of the market is a \u2013 I think a good thing for Americans, good thing for borrowers, good thing for the originators, because we are getting paid for the work that we're doing, the value-add.", "Kevin Barker ", "Okay and then just to mention - follow-up on some of the comments on the extension of the duration of the balance sheet this quarter with the use of interest rate swaps. Could you provide some more details on why you are increasing your duration at this point in the cycle? Is it a change in your view on, whether you want to be patient for higher rates or is there some other reason why you would extend the duration now?", "John Shrewsberry", "So, what's been happening for a while, we are talking about it a little bit more now and maybe it was a little bit starker in this quarter because deposit growth slowed also, so you saw cash balances go down while both securities and loans went up. But as you suggest, it\u2019s regardless of what's happening with short-term rates and over what period of time that normalization of policy occurs, it's our expectation that the longer-end of the curve, that we are going to be lower for longer than we would have thought six months ago, a year ago, or a couple of years ago and how we are managing the balance sheet is a reflection of that.", "Kevin Barker ", "Is there anything specific that you are seeing that would change your view that has changed your view in the last six months?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, in the last 6 to 12 months, I would say, what's happened with rates around the world has been a big reminder that a 2.5% US tenure is a really attractive asset and could be for a really long time. So that's why I say regardless of what's happening with Fed funds, we are preparing ourselves for a long march on - at the longer end of the curve. And if we are wrong, we have to be prepared for that in terms of what it means to capital et cetera, and we certainly are and we - that drastically to make sure that we've protected our balance sheet. But in the mean time, we are getting our assets more productively deployed. I would point out, there is still $250 billion worth of cash in the bank. So there is plenty of short-term liquidity and dry powder for what happens if we are wrong and there are more attractive entry points on the way back up, if that were to occur, but it's a good question.", "Kevin Barker ", "Thank you for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your last question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Bush ", "The best for last.", "John Stumpf", "Always. Hi, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush ", "Hi, couple questions on the mortgage front. JPMorgan Chase reported a very strong production quarter in jumbo mortgages this morning. How are you guys positioned in that market and what percentage or rough percentage of your production are jumbos?", "John Shrewsberry", "About 25% of our production are jumbos and that includes, of course, many of our most valuable customers in terms of the breadth of the total relationship. We carry them on our balance sheet as you know. ", "Nancy Bush ", "Right.", "John Shrewsberry", "And, I think the total category right now for jumbos on our books is about $120 billion, $125 billion of the - call it $1.7 trillion overall.", "Nancy Bush ", "Okay. And just a question on the mortgage business as a whole, I mean, do you consider at this point, given all the gyrations we've had in the mortgage business in the past ten years, are we at what you consider to be, a normal mortgage market right now and are you staffed appropriately for that market or where does sort of the mechanics of the mortgage business stand for you right now?", "John Shrewsberry", "So, in terms of staffing, I am sure it's true that we are probably a little bit heavy in some areas around loss mitigation and working NPA's and foreclosed assets through the system versus where we might be in a completely normalized point in the cycle just because they are still elevated. So there is probably opportunity there over some period of time.", "From a policy normalcy point of view, there is still other things happening, whether it's agency reform, the relationship between the FHA and the industry is still not completely settled and that has to happen for people to feel good about things. We are still in those second - no meaningful secondary market for non-conforming loans and there was a good one for prime, jumbo loans that existed pre-crisis and so at some point that probably has to re-emerge and that hasn't happened yet. But, we are just as committed to the business. It's a very important part of the relationship between us and our customers, because buying and financing a home is one of the most significant things our customers will ever do. We enjoy our status as the largest mortgage servicer in the land and our status as the largest mortgage originator as well. So, we are working hard to try and shape good outcomes in those areas that are still unsettled and we are making the most of it during the period that we are in.", "John Stumpf", "And, Nancy, it's an insightful question because I think part of the distinguishing features of big scale players in this business where you are successful or not is how quickly you can scale up when business opportunities present themselves and how quickly you can scale down. And, we think we are pretty good at that among other things. And some are surprised that mortgage market has not come back stronger, but we went through a pretty deep downturn. This was the asset class that had the problem in 2008 and 2009 and it steadily \u2013 and it's improving and healing. But it's going to take time. And so, like John said, we really like this business for a whole host of reasons. ", "Nancy Bush ", "I would just ask as an add-on question, Bank of America talks about their legacy asset servicing, et cetera, which is mostly mortgages that were still on the books that they are working out. Where are you guys in - working out any problems you got through the Wachovia deal, et cetera? I mean, are you pretty much through the workout period now with most of that stuff?", "John Stumpf", "Well, the pick-a-pay was probably the most problematic of that portfolio and that came over - let's say in the $120 billion range - $120 billion or so; and it\u2019s $54 billion give or take now. And the average loan to value in that is in the 60s.", "Nancy Bush ", "All right.", "John Stumpf", "So, and if you look at -- if you look at the overall servicing portfolio we have, it's 94%, 95% current and so it\u2019s - we've -- still issues going through there, there is some judicial foreclosure states that we are still having to work through. But for the most part, it's performed above our expectations, especially with respect to the Wachovia part and I think we are in the later innings of working on this and as John mentioned, there is some opportunity to take some cost out. The cost of servicing a current loan versus one that's delinquent is such a big difference. So, when people look at these portfolios you like to look at the past dues, because it really \u2013 and the ones in the foreclosures because that really skews the costs on those.", "John Shrewsberry", "I know that this is clear in the materials, Nancy, but we are \u2013 where our non-strategic or wind down portfolio is picking down at $2 billion to $3 billion per quarter and there is $50 billion odd of it left. So, the tail of it will be here for a while.", "Nancy Bush ", "Okay. All right, thank you very much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you. Well, this concludes our call. Thank you again for spending time with us. It's always enjoyable for us to represent our 265,000 team members and the work that they do every quarter and John and I and Jim will see you on next quarter.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and CFO, Tim Sloan will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. Wells Fargo had a terrific quarter and has now generated 14 consecutive quarters of earnings per share growth, with record earnings in the second quarter. This consistent strong performance during our dynamic economic and interest rate environment again demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model.", "We are not dependent on any one business to generate growth. We have over 90 businesses that are all focused on just one thing, meeting our customer\u2019s financial needs. Our results this quarter demonstrate the momentum we have throughout for all of our businesses.", "Our strong performance is broad based compared to a year-ago we earned a record $5.5 billion, up 19% and grew earnings per share of 20%. We grew pre-tax pre-provision profit by 3%. We reduced our expenses and improved our efficiency ratio by 90 basis points to 57.3%. Our core loan portfolio grew by $42.3 billion, up 6%. Our credit performance was outstanding, benefiting from our conservative underwriting in improving economic conditions, especially of housing with net charge-offs down to 58 basis points and our total net charge-off down 48% from just a year-ago.", "Our strong deposit franchise, which becomes even more valuable in a rising great environment continue to grow, with total deposits up 10% from a year-ago, while we reduced total deposit cost by 5 basis points to 14 basis points.", "We achieved record retail cross-sell of 6.14 products per household. Wholesale Banking grew their cross-sell to 6.9 products and Wealth Brokerage Retirement cross-sell increased to over 10 products \u2013 10.35 to be exact. We grew return on assets by 14 basis points to 1.55% and return on equity increased by 116 basis points to 14.02%.", "Our capital levels continue to grow with our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III increasing to 8.54% and based on our initial review of the leverage ratio proposed \u2013 proposal issued this week; we believe our current leverage levels would exceed the well capitalized requirements at both the bank and the holding company.", "Our strong earnings growth has enabled us to grow our capital levels, while returning more capital to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we increased our dividends to $0.30 a share, up 36% from a year-ago and we continue to buyback stock.", "Before turning the call over to Tim, let me conclude with some comments about my views on how the current economic and rate environment impacts Wells Fargo. We continue to be optimistic about the improvements we\u2019re seeing throughout the economy. While commercial loan demand is still modest, jobs are been created, consumer confidence is increasing and the housing market continue to demonstrate strong momentum.", "In fact, in the second quarter, the housing market improvement was stronger and more broad-based than it has been since before 2008. Sales were up and residential property prices increased in by 13% across the country. Yet, affordability still remains attractive, even with the increased prices and higher interest rates. The strength in the housing market was a positive catalyst to our results in the second quarter in a number of ways including higher originations performed purchases, lower environmental costs, reduced repurchase reserves and improved credit quality.", "Assuming the housing market state remains strong, and we currently believe it will, our overall results will continue to reflect these benefits. While the economy continues it\u2019s slow, but steady improvement, the current rate environment is obviously very different than it was just 90 days ago when we last announced our earnings.", "We knew rates would eventually rise as we\u2019ve been planning for a rising rate environment for sometime. The benefit of our diversified business models is that it provides opportunities to generate earnings growth over a variety of rate environment. Some of our businesses can actually do better in a lower rate environment and others benefit from the rising rates.", "Tim will highlight the growth we\u2019ve achieved across a number of our businesses on our call today. We do not manage Wells Fargo based on a specific rate environment. We manage Wells Fargo as we have for decades to satisfy our customer\u2019s financial needs. Rates rising for the right reason and improving economy is beneficial for our customers, which then in turn benefits Wells Fargo.", "Tim will now provide more details on our second quarter results. Tim?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments would follow the presentation included in the first half of our quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then take your questions.", "As John mentioned, Wells Fargo had another outstanding quarter with record earnings of $5.5 billion, up 19% from a year-ago and up 7% from the first quarter. Earnings per share grew to $0.98, up 20% from last year and up 7% from the first quarter. We\u2019ve now achieved 14 consecutive quarters of EPS and nine consecutive quarters of record earnings per share.", "As John just mentioned, the rate environment this quarter was very different from last quarter. In fact, the economic housing rate environment has differed significantly over the past 14 quarters of our earnings growth. While the drivers of our growth have varied, our consistent risk discipline and diversified business model have remained the same.", "Our results this quarter compared to the first quarter, clearly show the advantage of our diversity with our bottom line results benefiting from strong broad based trends including net interest income growth as we drew loans and invested in securities, fee growth across a variety of our businesses, reduced expenses generating positive operating leverage and improved credit and capital levels.", "As you can see on page 3, our year-over-year results were also strong with growth in pre-tax, pre-provision profit, net income, EPS, both total and core loans, core deposits, ROA and ROE.", "Our revenue diversification is highlighted on slide 4. A 50-50 split between spread revenue and fee revenue from our diversified businesses and cross-sell activities. Trust and investment fees were once again our largest fee category and it has been for the past five quarters. We achieved positive momentum across many of our businesses which I'll highlight throughout the call.", "Let me start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our second quarter results from the balance sheet and income statement perspective. On page 5, you can see we had good balance sheet growth this quarter growing loans, deposits and securities. I'll provide more detail on the securities we purchased later on the call. The decline in our provision expense this quarter reflected improvement in home prices and our overall credit performance.", "Turning to the income statement on page 6, mortgage revenue was stable in the quarter and revenue growth was driven by stronger trust and investment fees and higher net interest income. Our expenses declined as we expected primarily reflecting seasonally lower employee benefit costs.", "Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page 7, we continued to have solid loan growth with period end loans up $26.8 billion or 3% from the year ago and up $2 billion from the first quarter. Loans grew even after the continued run off of our liquidating portfolio. This portfolio has declined by over 50% since 2008 and the headwind to overall loan growth caused by this run-off has continued to slow. ", "In the second quarter, the liquidating portfolio declined $15.5 billion from a year ago and $3.2 billion from the first quarter. Excluding these liquidating loans, our core loan portfolio grew by $42.3 billion or 6% from a year ago and was up $5.2 billion from the first quarter.", "Commercial loans grew $1.8 billion in the quarter with board-based growth in C&I and foreign loans. Consumer loans grew $250 million with growth in nonconforming first mortgage loans, auto and credit card, partially offset by the expected run-off from liquidating and core home equity portfolios.", "Deposit growth remained strong with period end deposits up $10.9 billion from the first quarter. Average deposits were up $23.6 billion from the first quarter and up $85.8 billion or 9% from the year ago. Average core checking and savings deposits were up 8% from a year ago. We grew our primary consumer checking customers by a net 3.5% from a year ago, up 2.1% from last quarter. These are active checking account customers who transact with Wells Fargo regularly.", "The growth we've achieved with these relationship-based customers demonstrate the strength of our deposit franchise and should generate future growth as we focus on remaining their primary bank and meeting more of their financial needs. We continued to lower our deposit costs with average deposit costs of 14 basis points in the second quarter, down 1 basis point from the first quarter and down 5 basis points from the year ago. We've successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit costs for 10 consecutive quarters.", "As shown on page 9, we grew tax-equivalent net interest income by 3% from the first quarter. The growth in NII was driven by securities purchases, lower funding costs, loan growth, higher variable income as well as the benefit from an extra day in the quarter. Average earning assets grew $31.1 billion from the first quarter, reflecting increases in short-term investments, loans and AFS securities. We purchased $21 billion of AFS securities during the second quarter, primarily agency MBS, and we purchased an additional $6 billion of securities in the first two weeks of the third quarter.", "We remained disciplined during periods of lower rates and we were prepared to deploy liquidity as rates rose. We benefitted from this disciplined approach in the second quarter by investing in higher yield and securities. While higher rates driven by an improving economy will be positive to our results over the long term, including higher yielding earning asset growth and improving credit quality, there are also some short-term effects such as lower mortgage refi volume and reduced OCI that I'll highlight throughout the call.", "Higher rates impact our businesses in different ways and in different times, which reinforces the benefit of our diversified model. Our net interest margin declined by 2 basis points from the first quarter to 3.46%. This decline was driven by three primary factors. First, our continued deposit growth caused cash and short-term investments to increase reducing the margin by 6 basis points.", "As I've highlighted in the past our deposit growth has little impact on net interest income but it is dilutive to the net interest margin. Offsetting this decline by 2 basis points was higher variable income including higher PCI loan resolutions and periodic dividends. This variable income is obviously lumpy and can increase or decrease in any quarter.", "Finally, the net impact of re-pricing and balance sheet growth improved the margin by 2 basis points largely due to the benefit of the growth in the AFS portfolio and reduced funding costs. While margin was relatively stable this quarter, it is still reasonable to expect continued net interest margin pressure.", "Despite a decline in total fee income in the quarter, many of our businesses demonstrated strong momentum including deposit service charges up $34 million from the first quarter benefitting from seasonality and account growth. Trust and investment fees up $292 million on strong investment banking fees and higher retail brokerage asset based fees. Card fees grew 75 million on credit and debit card account growth and higher purchase volume. Commercial real estate brokerage commissions grew $28 million with strong activity for both private and public deals.", "Overall, noninterest income was down slightly from the first quarter on lower gains from deferred compensation plan investment income which is P&L neutral, weaker customer accommodation trading and lower fees including the lower gain on the sale of the PCI loans.", "Our mortgage business continued to generate strong results in the second quarter with revenue up modestly from the first quarter as highlighted on page 11. Mortgage originations were $112 billion, our seventh consecutive quarter of more than a $100 billion in originations reflecting the benefit of the housing market improvement and low interest rates. As rates rose late in the quarter, applications for home purchases remained strong but refi application volumes declined as expected.", "We still had a relatively large unclosed pipeline at the end of the quarter but refi volume is obviously very sensitive to rates. Refis were 56% of originations in the second quarter, down from 69% in the first quarter. We managed through many refi cycles in the past and we will adjust the size of our business based on production volumes through this cycle. Gain on sales margins declined to 2.21% and with the increase in mortgage rates, we would expect further declines in our margins and originations.", "Expenses declined from seasonally high first quarter levels as shown on page 12. This decline was driven by a 4% reduction in personnel expenses reflecting lower employee benefit expenses due to the first quarter seasonally high payroll taxes and 401(k) matching. These declines were partially offset by higher salaries reflecting annual merit increases and higher revenue-based incentive compensation expense from strong results in capital markets, WBR and mortgage.", "We also had increases in other expense categories primarily driven by our continued investment in our business to drive future growth, including project spending for product improvement and system enhancements, higher advertising and promotion expense driven by seasonality and a new campaign launched in the second quarter.", "Operating losses increased $131 million in the second quarter, primarily from litigation accruals related to various legal matters and we also experienced increased costs associated with regulatory and compliance requirements. Our focus on reducing expenses while investing in our businesses to generate revenue growth is reflected in our efficiency ratio declining to 57.3% in the second quarter. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain within our target range of 55% to 59%.", "As John mentioned at the start of the call, the recovery in the housing market is driving significant improvement in a number of areas, including some of our environmentally elevated costs. As highlighted on page 13, in the second quarter, most of these costs were significantly below what they had been over the past few years.", "We got a nominal amount of cost associated with the independent foreclosure review this quarter of customer call volumes following the distribution of remediation checks. The improvement in real estate values helped to reduce foreclosed asset expenses by $49 million compared to the first quarter and by $143 million from a year ago. Mortgage revenue this quarter was reduced by $25 million for additions to our repurchase reserve not related to card originations which is the lowest build we\u2019ve had since prior to 2008.", "Outstanding and purchase demands were relatively stable compared with the first quarter and new demands emerged consistent with our expectations. However not all elevated costs are behind us. Mortgage revenue is reduced by $82 million to reflect higher servicing and foreclosure costs as foreclosure timelines continue to extend especially in judicial foreclosure states.", "Turning to our segment results starting at page 14, community banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter up 28% from a year ago and up 11% from the first quarter. Retail banking achieved a record cross-sell of 6.14 products per household up from 6 products a year ago. To support sales and household growth we grew platform bank or FTE by approximately 1,900 from a year ago.", "Our credit card business continued to have strong account growth with the record 594,000 new accounts in the second quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Our household penetration increased to 35%, up from 31% a year ago. Credit card balances were up 3% from the first quarter and up 9% from a year ago due to strong transaction volumes and account growth.", "We also had momentum in our auto business with record originations in the second quarter of $7.1 billion up 4% from the first quarter and up 9% from a year ago. Our continued focus on serving our small business customers generated a 2.7% growth in business checking accounts from a year ago and we extended $9.3 billion of new loan commitments to small business customers during the first half of the year up 25% from a year ago.", "Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter up 7% from a year ago and down $41 million from the first quarter. Wholesale banking generated record revenue of $6.1 billion. Investment banking fee growth was strong driven by higher equity underwriting, credit originations and loan syndication fees. Investment banking results included a 34% increase in the year-to-date revenue from commercial and corporate customers. This relationship focus also benefited treasury management as revenue grew 12% from a year ago benefiting from better penetration of our existing customers.", "Wholesale banking\u2019s cross-sell reached 6.9 products per relationship up from 6.8 a year ago. Wholesale banking results continue to benefit from steady loan growth with loans having grown for a 11 consecutive quarters. The average loans increased 6% from a year ago with growth nearly all portfolios including asset back finance, capital finance, commercial banking, commercial real estate, corporate banking and government and institutional banking. Credit quality remained strong with net recoveries in the second quarter reflecting the improvement in our economy and our risk in underwriting discipline.", "Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned a record $434 million, up 27% from a year ago and up 29% from the first quarter reflecting the success of our core business strategy of growing asset based relationships and the benefit from the improvement in the markets. Revenue grew 10% from a year ago reflecting strong growth in asset based fees and higher brokerage transaction revenue.", "Retail, brokerage, managed account assets reached the record $331 billion, up 19% from a year ago driven by strong net flows and market performance. WBR had strong loan growth with average loans up 4% from the first quarter driven by non-conforming mortgages. WBR continued to effectively partner with retail banking to meet the financial needs of our customers, increasing cross-sell to 10.3 products per household. Assets referred from community banking to WBR grew over 25% from a year ago based on first quarter results. This partnership is a great example of how our businesses work together to meet the financial needs of our customers.", "Turning to credit quality on Page 17, we had continued improvement across our commercial and consumer portfolios. Second quarter net charge-offs declined to 58 basis points of average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only $44 million or 5 basis points of average loans. Consumer losses declined to 101 basis points. We had especially strong improvement in our commercial and residential real estate portfolios. These portfolios are now providing a tailwind for our credit performance compared to the headwind they provided when the real estate market was weaker.", "Reflecting these improvements our provision expense declined $567 million from the first quarter and included $500 million in reserve releases, compared with the release of $200 million in the first quarter and $400 million from a year ago. We continue to expect further reserve releases absent a significant deterioration in the economic environment and while we don\u2019t know what our release will be in the third quarter the favorable condition to grow this release for this quarter have not dissipated.", "The recovery in the housing market also benefited our expected losses in the PCI portfolio. This quarter the accretable yield balance increased by a net $2.1 billion which included $1.6 billion increase in expected cash flows and $876 million reclassification primarily from our pick-pay portfolio. This re-class did not impact second quarter results but will be accreted into income over the remaining life of these loans.", "In addition to lower charge-offs and provision expense non-performing asset also improved with MPAs down $1.8 million from the first quarter and down $3.8 billion or 15% from a year ago. Loans 90 days or more passed due decreased $206 million from the first quarter and were down 15% from a year ago with improvement in both commercial and consumer loans. Early stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also declined from the first quarter and from a year ago.", "Earnings are the primary driver of capital growth for Wells Fargo. As shown on Page 19, our Tier 1 common equity ratio included 10.73%, up 34 basis points from last quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel 3 which reflects our interpretation over Basel 3 capital rules adopted July 2, increased to 8.54% in the second quarter. OCI negatively impacted the ratio by 24 basis points in the quarter due to the increase in interest rates. Because of our strong earnings growth we grew capital even with the impact on the increasing rates. We expect reductions to unrealized securities gains when rates rise and this is one reason why as we discussed over a year-ago we're targeting a capital buffer of approximately 100 basis points.", "And just this week, as John mentioned the U.S. regulatory agencies issued a supplemental leverage ratio of proposal. Based on our initial review we believe our current levels -- leverage levels would exceed the well capitalized requirements at both the bank and holding company. We increased our second quarter dividend to $0.30 per share a 20% increase over the first quarter dividend and purchased 26.7 million shares in the second quarter and executed a $500 million forward contract that is expected to settle in the third quarter for approximately 13 million shares.", "Including the shares under the forward contract, our share count would have been relatively flat for the quarter offsetting 40 million shares issued during the quarter primarily related to profit sharing and match contributions to 401(NYSE:K) plans and team members exercising option. With many opportunities to generate growth at Wells Fargo on Slide 20 we summarized the demonstrative momentum we have throughout our businesses that I\u2019ve highlighted on the call. In each of our businesses we have opportunities for growth reflecting the expanding needs of our customers. This customer account and balance growth along with increased cross-sell with help drive our future results and reflects the benefits of our diversified model.", "In summary we had a very good quarter with strong broad based improvement and demonstrative momentum across many of our businesses. This included growth in loans, deposits, net interest income and fee growth across many of our businesses. We reduced expenses and benefited from a continued improvement in credit quality that reflected our conservative underwriting and the strengthening economy especially the rebound in housing. Our ROA and ROE continue to grow and we grew capital levels while returning more capital to shareholders.", "We will now open up the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions). Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, good morning.", "John G. Stumpf", "Good morning, John.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Morning.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Tim, just a question on liquidity. Could you tell us where you are on the liquidity coverage ratio relative to your understanding of what will be required of you in the new regulatory rules?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah. John, it's a good question. One of the challenges is that the rules haven't been finalized and similar to the Basel III capital rules from the point that which they were originally proposed to where they were finalized, there was a fair amount of discussion in change. I would tell you that we have adequate capital to operate Wells Fargo. Having said that, we are going to continue to work with the regulators in terms of those interpretations. There may be some incremental amount of liquidities that we need to raise, but we certainly \u2013 it's certainly that we are focused on because liquidity risk is a key risk for the company. But given over $1 trillion of deposits we have and given the experience we have in terms of operating in different environments, again we think we've got adequate liquidity. We may need to raise a little bit more but it shouldn't be material for the company.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. So it's a factor in \u2013 as you think about the pace at which you look for your cash, you mentioned buying some securities here today. Is that a factor in how you think about deploying your liquidity?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, it's not a big factor at all, John. Again, to me it's much more important to think about the liquidity needs for operating the business as it relates to how much we want to invest in securities because the first call for any of our liquidity has always got to be to our customers in terms of loan demand. But it's not a primary driver in terms of the pace of activity. The primary driver in terms of the pace of our investment activity has been there over the last year. We've been in this very low rate environment and turned the clock back a year ago, we had a lot of excess liquidity, there was a lot of concern that we were going to be in low rates for a while and there was a view that we weren't investing fast enough. We wanted to stay disciplined then. That was the primary driver. Just like today, one of the primary drivers for why we're investing more in our securities portfolio is because we think given the rate back up, the returns are much more attractive.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Yeah. And we did see a benefit there in the degree of net interest margin compression, but you still have an expectation for some continued margin compression. What are the drivers there, Tim? And then in terms of NII dollars, do you still expect to grow the NII dollars from the current level?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Okay. So on the net interest margin, I don't think the drivers have really changed that much. As you recall, if you look at our net interest margin decline, which we've had one over the last year 14 quarters, the primary driver for the decline has been the fact that we've been growing deposits which long-term \u2013 for the company, financing that. Within a quarter, we can have some variability based upon the variable income which was positive this quarter but last quarter was negative. The balance sheet continues to re-price a bit. So the factors really haven't changed because we haven't gotten to a point that the balance sheet has completely re-priced. So we could continue to see some continued compression in the net interest margin. The underlying factors really haven't changed. In terms of net interest income and our goal is to grow net interest income over time. What happens in a quarter-by-quarter basis I just don't know for sure because there's a lot of factors. We had a lot of positive factors that drove our net interest income this quarter which I think was absolutely terrific. Again, I don't know if that means we're going to grow net interest income in the third quarter, but over time I believe that we can grow net interest income and this quarter I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And switching gears over to the mortgage revenues, the gain on sale margin of the 221 you mentioned hold up better than expected. What were the factors there? And is there any framing you can do for us on how much pressure that market could experience as you move to the next several quarters?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, John, I think that's a very fair observation and candidly I think the mortgage sale margin has held up better not just for the last quarter but for the last year than I think anybody in the business or in industry would have expected. That said, it has come down and it came down over 30 basis points in the quarter. And our best guess is that we are seeing pressure in the gain on sale margin and the gain on sale margin has significantly declined. Recall that last quarter we framed the gain on sale margin variability over last few years if you annualize it, the low end was 160 and the high end again on an annualized basis was 220. We've been at the high end. We think we're going to start to move down from there. So I think there is going to be pressure. I do not believe you're going to see a 2.21% gain on sale margin, I think it's more likely to be lower. But again, it's really a function of the competitive environment which we think has been very rational as we've gone through this cycle as well as the rate environment. Recall that our best guess in the second quarter was that originations were going to be a little bit lower than the first quarter but in fact originations were up in the second quarter because rates stayed low for a longer period of time. Rates are now up and that's going to affect originations for sure. So there's a lot of variability but to put it very bluntly we think that the gain on sale margin is going to decline and it will decline somewhere in the range of what we've seen over the last few years, but it is going to decline.", "John G. Stumpf", "But John as you know and Tim's absolutely right, it will decline and margins will be under some pressure but we have this wonderfully balanced business within the business. In other words when rates increase, refis drop, margins come in because there's more competition but then you have a servicing portfolio and that does better. So there's balance within this business and there's also a flush down in the broad distribution and diversity within the company. So some businesses do better, some do not as well when rates rise.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Thanks, John. Tim, one follow-up on that. Could you remind us of the mechanics by which the higher servicing income can work its way through the income statement and why didn't \u2013 it didn't seem like we saw any of that start this quarter with the big move into 10-year. What will trigger kind of offsetting balance on the servicing side where the income then will see that start to rise?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, John points out over time I think that there is some balance in the business on the revenue side because of the fact that servicing income tends to be a little bit less volatile. We should see some benefit in terms of servicing income increasing as the housing industry continues to improve. As we pointed out, we did reduce the value of this servicing for some elongation of some foreclosure timelines. Over time that will dissipate. And then we'll continue to get the carry in the underlying servicing income. Our hedge ratio is pretty high, so it's not like we're vetting the farm on or the stagecoach on an increase in rates in the servicing portfolio. We'll see some benefit there, but I think it's also really important to remember that there will also be some expense trade-offs in the mortgage business itself. If it turns out that originations are down, then it's immediately in the quarter if you get a benefit from the revenue-based compensation, the commissions coming down and then to the extent that that volume continues, then you also make adjustments that tend to be on a lag basis, on a quarterly basis in terms of some of your other expenses.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Are you starting to make those adjustments based on what you're seeing in the pipeline and the outlook given rates?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "John, we're making adjustments all the time. The fact of the matter is we entered the quarter with actually a pretty strong pipeline of $63 billion which was only down 10%, 15% from the end of the quarter. But there's no question that to the extent that we continue to see a decline in the pipeline that we will make adjustments. And so you can assume that we will begin to make some of those adjustments this quarter.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Got it, okay. Thanks.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.", "Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning.", "John G. Stumpf", "Good morning, Erika.", "Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "My first question is a follow-up to John's last. We heard another mega bank today say that if loan rates stay where they are that the mortgage market could shrink to 30% or 40% in the second half of the year. Do you agree with that statement for your company, given what you\u2019re seeing in purchase trends? And additionally, could you quantify if that number is correct? How much of the expenses can come up proportionate to that 30% to 40% decline?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, it\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t think anybody really knows what the volumes in the mortgage business are going to be. I think one of the challenges for anybody in making that estimate today is that the complexion of the originations is really changing. When you look at the percentage of refi volume versus purchase money volume that we had in the first quarter of this year for example, it was about 1/3 purchase money and about 2/3s refi volume.", "As the housing industry continues to improve and as we\u2019ve got it \u2013 went into the spring selling season, you saw that mix shift in sales was more like 55, 44, 45 or whatever and what that means is that a larger portion of your originations are coming from the purchase portion of the business. So, I think it is a fact that refinance volume is certainly very much impacted by rates, but also we\u2019re seeing now rates at the long end start to come down 10 basis points just in the last few days and so we don\u2019t think \u2013 we don\u2019t know for sure where volume is going to be. We believe it's going to be lower in this quarter and one of the things that we\u2019ve learned in the mortgage business is, it's probably not a good thing to think, six months out or nine months out because there can be so much variability.", "We think volumes going to be down, but whether it\u2019s going to be 30% to 40%, I just don\u2019t know. As it relates to expenses, again, the timeline generally is that the revenue based compensation declined immediately and then to the extent we have a continued origination reduction, then you bring \u2013 you start to reduce some of your expenses that tends to occur on a lag quarter basis. But at the end of the day we still believe that we can continue to have good margins in the business and to keep the efficiency ratio above where it is, because also remember that one of the other important things that\u2019s going out into business, if you got an improvement in the underlying housing industry so that your environmental related costs hopefully will coming down including foreclosures at the same time.", "John G. Stumpf", "One of the thing that \u2013 I know that we should not forget now we went through this a lot \u2013 many times, but we have 6,200 stores, 30,000 or 40,000 personal bankers that refer business in, so when rates rise and its more of a purchase money business we have all folks on deck helping serve customers. And we still have tons of our customers who are interested in buying homes and moving and so forth who are our customers, but do their mortgage business in other places. So we have still lot of opportunity to capture purchase money business, which is still not at the levels it was, pre-prices. So, there is lots of activity going on there. Surely, the refinance volume is going to come down significantly, if rates continue to stay at high. But as Tim mentioned, I don\u2019t know what rates will be. 90 days ago we wouldn\u2019t have talked about what we\u2019re talking about today. Things change very quickly in this business.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, Erika, let me reinforce again. As you think about the third quarter, and you think about the volume that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been very fortunate to see quarters in which volume is been above the $100 billion. We just don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to see $100 billion in mortgage volume, given the current rates today in the third quarter.", "Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Speaking of how Wells benefit as housing recovers, I know that you\u2019re frustrated by the obsession on your margin. But as I think about slide 26 in your deck, it seems like you have $876 million of reclassification to accretable yield and $1.6 billion of additional expected cash flows that could be helpful to your margin over time. Should we think of the pick-a-pay portfolio similar to how we think about reserve relief for the entire company in that as housing gets better, you could release some of the markets into net interest income which would benefit or alleviate some of the concerns on margin.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "There is no question that, that the key drivers for the improvement in the \u2013 or the reclassification or housing prices as well as the underlying credit performance within that portfolio and those are very similar to the drivers for the improvement that we\u2019ve seen in our first mortgage portfolio and our home equity portfolios.", "In terms of the impact, I\u2019d love to tell you that when \u2013 if you re-class the 876, we get an immediate impact, that\u2019s not the way it works. It occurs over the life of the loan. There will be some positive impact and you\u2019ve seen that and I\u2019m hopeful if the current trends continue, and this isn\u2019t the last time that we seen a reclassification, I can\u2019t promise you that it's going to be the case. But it will provide some positive benefit over time. But again, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we put it in the right context because our best estimate is the weighted life of that portfolio is still about 14 years.", "Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Got it. And just, if I could sneak one more in, just a clarification follow-up to John\u2019s question on the LCR. Your cash balances keep growing, but in other calls you\u2019ve mentioned that you have \u2013 something like $50 billion of excess cash. Is that true still, relative to how we should think about Basel III LCR compliance? And I guess, if the main message is potentially the cash back until continue to build from here?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, I think that the challenge we all have including where we\u2019re in terms of the liquidity coverage ratio is the rules haven\u2019t been finalized. If you would tell me what the final rules are, then I could tell you whether or not we\u2019re too much or not enough for the write or whatever. What I do know is that we believe that we have additional ability based on how we\u2019re running Wells Fargo based on our interpretations of the LCR to invest some of our liquidity in securities, but more importantly we have it ready for our customers when they want to borrow money. That doesn\u2019t mean that we made \u2013 now that raise liquidity, when some of the rules are finalized. But we don\u2019t believe and we believe that, that\u2019s possible to do without a significant impact or material impact in terms of running the company. But again, I think it will be premature to conclude what the final rules like \u2013 look like because they haven\u2019t been finalized.", "Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "John G. Stumpf", "Good morning, Matt.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Hopefully just a couple of quick ones here. You mentioned the trust investment fees, good strength in both the brokerage and investment banking, which of course you now split out. On the broker side, is that just the higher market levels or are you seeing some inflows there as well? I did notice that the deposits in that segment were down a couple of billion, so I\u2019m just wondering if there is some flows coming into the brokerage area?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well I think it\u2019s all the above, Matt. There is no question that we\u2019ve been benefited as everybody in the industry has been benefited by the improving market, the improving equity markets and the fact that retail investors want to be part of that business. We did see some movement from deposits to investing in the market. We think that\u2019s a good thing. We\u2019ve been waiting for that for a while, but we also grew our customer levels too.", "John G. Stumpf", "And Matt the other thing, this is a big emphasis for the Company. David Carroll and his great team are working with Carrie Tolstedt and her team and Dave Hoyt and within the company this is a one Wells Fargo working together. So not only the markets help us, we\u2019re also putting a big emphasis on this. We think it\u2019s a big growth opportunity for this Company.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "And then, just separately on the mortgage servicing rights, I know you\u2019ve talked about potentially testing the waters to sell and sorry if I missed it, but did you sell any this quarter and thoughts going forward in terms of potentially selling them. I would think they\u2019re worth a little bit more now than two months ago?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "We hope that\u2019s the case Matt. I think that as you know we entered into a transaction to sell our \u2013 a portion of our reversed mortgage portfolio in the first quarter. We didn\u2019t have any sales of MSRs this quarter. But we will continue to look at selling MSRs, we think that\u2019s prudent risk management that the primary driver for doing that is not because we feel like there is pressure as it relates to capital. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we moved forward and executed a sale of MSRs this quarter and next.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of R. Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Scott.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Hi, Scott.", "R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill", "Good morning. John, I guess I was just hoping you could expand kind of generally on the comments you made in your prep remarks early on about the housing market. I guess what I'm thinking about is high rates impact affordability but you certainly seem pretty optimistic about the prospects for the housing market and continued improvement. So what trends are you seeing generally, particularly I guess most recently just since you guys see so much of the mortgage and customarily the housing market that makes you keep this sustained optimism?", "John G. Stumpf", "Sure. So first of all, I think I had mentioned before that we look at 400 or so MSAs, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and we have a unique and pretty grounded way of seeing real estate across the country. And the deal, it's better everywhere or going on \u2013 in some cases two years surely in the past year and it's been stronger in some places than even probably we had expected. Some of the states that were hardest hit, Nevada, Florida, Arizona, California, are showing huge or very large price appreciation kinds of numbers. Also if you look at \u2013 and yes, rates have gone up but if you were in the mortgage market before 2000, you know that these are unbelievably good rates. My first mortgage was at 8.5%, my second one was 11.5% and I thought those were great rates at the time. So affordability still is there, household formation continued to happen in the last four or five years where people weren't buying, so there's a lot of pent-up demand. The three important issues to a home purchase what you make, what the house costs and what's the financing costs? One of those is still close to 40, 50-year record lows compared to rental. Owning a home makes economic sense. It surely depends on where you want to live and how long you want to live there and so forth. So there is just strength there. And it improves customer confidence. The thing I hear most about when I'm out in the marketplace is the lack of inventory. So we are expecting that prices will continue to improve, probably not at the level they have in the past but housing sure has strength to it. So I don't know what's going to happen to rates all the time but when housing improves, it's good for Americans, it's good for competence and which in turn is good for the financial services industry and Wells Fargo.", "R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill", "All right, I appreciate the color. And then I guess, Tim, sort of along the same lines. You're consumer credit improvement, I guess we kind of knew would improve. I think the magnitude was probably a little better than I would have anticipated. If we were to say stay at this sort of level of housing, I mean is there a point where you need continued improvement to impact the sustainability of such strong consumer trends or are we there yet or how are you thinking about that dynamic?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, I think it's a fair question, Scott. The underlying trends that in fact John referred to are still improved. And so it's hard to imagine improvement not continuing. Whether it continues to improve at the same rate, I don't know. I think we've continued to be surprised by how housing has positively impacted our results. I think also it's important to remember that particularly when you think about the reserve release that there were some overwriting factors that impacted the reserve release over the last few quarters including the fact that we had the OCC guidance that impacted the third and fourth quarters of last year and also the potential for the impact from the damage of Hurricane Sandy that's been working its way through the system. But again, I think the fundamentals for housing are strong. We have a large first mortgage and second mortgage portfolio that tends to be the portfolio where we have the disproportionate share of our losses even though they improved, the consumer losses improved just a touch over 1% this quarter. So we're feeling pretty good about the improvement.", "John G. Stumpf", "Scott, I'll just add one more thing. Housing is uniquely different than any other consumer asset class. When housing improves, people feel better. I mean two-thirds of Americans or so own a home. When housing improves, it improves the confidence. People spend more. The multiplier effect on buying washers and dryers and other consumer goods is just \u2013 it's just very special around housing. So when housing gets better, it really lifts all [bolts] on the consumer side.", "R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay. Well, guys, I definitely appreciate the help. Thank you.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thank you, Scott.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi. Good morning.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "First question, Tim, that other income line that you talk about the equity method and less PCI loan sale gains, that lines up into 450 million to 500 million for the last several years. Is there anything particular that happened this quarter and is there anything that would prevent it from kind of going back to that more normal run rate?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, good question. It's really not what happened, it's what didn't happen this quarter. The comparison in the first quarter and the primary drivers for the decline were \u2013 we had an equity investment that we accounted for under the equity method and as you know, when those appreciate in value as opposed to the cost method you have to go ahead and write up the value, which we did in the first quarter. Just so you know, we actually sold that equity investment so we got the cash in the second quarter. Then secondarily we had $151 million gain which we had called out in the first quarter from the sale of some PCI loans that again were in the first quarter that we just didn't have in the second quarter. So I think it's more of what was missing in the second quarter than what occurred. So I don't know what's going to happen in the third quarter but I think if you look over a long period of time, the income from that line item being as low as it has been is not typical.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "Right, okay. And then secondly, the share count again was up and you guys had talked about that we might be getting towards the point where we finally start to see it reduce and I'm just wondering, are we at that point and what needs to happen just with the [mix] to finally start getting the share count down?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "We were almost at that point this quarter. That's one of the reasons why I called out the fact that the timing of the settlement from a structured sale had that occurred in the second quarter and it's going to occur relatively early in the third quarter, we would have been about flat. Notwithstanding the second quarter tends to be a quarter in which there's more share issuance as we called out. I don't know exactly what's going to happen but my guess is that we're very close to the point at which we will start to see share reductions.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "Okay. And then on the mortgage business, the pipeline was down but you guys had mentioned last quarter that your closing times had gone down from 90 to 60. I'm just wondering how much of a market share opportunity is this, because it doesn't sound like you've really cut capacity yet. So could you just walk us through originations versus pipeline and how much more you're actually just pumping through the channel regardless of what's happening with the overall origination volumes in the marketplace?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah. Well, one of the reasons why we haven't made a lot of changes in terms of underlying business is that the increase in the rates only happened a few weeks ago and we had a large pipeline that we were working through. As you saw originations in the second quarter were a lot stronger than I think anyone would have imagined. So I think that's going to naturally begin to change because even through $64 billion is a great place to start, it's definite $63 million, it's definitely less than $79 million. And so our guess is that volume and originations will be under the $100 billion mark and we\u2019ll need to go ahead and make some adjustments, but again I think the competitive atmosphere is really fierce, but it's very rational.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "Okay and my last question Tim, with regard to your favorite slide. Your big delta in provision this quarter and you\u2019re talking about the mortgage banking revenue now is starting to turn from here. So, I know it's hard to say in any given quarter if you could actually be able to grow EPS a quarter ahead, but can you just talk us through again it's hard to see the provision much more and we know that mortgage is kind of tailing. So what do you expect to be the biggest drivers out of the net maybe the other income reverting back up to kind of continue to get that net income moving the right way.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, it's a very fair quarter given the potential decline in mortgage revenues but again let\u2019s make sure we put that in perspective. Mortgage revenues are a little over 10% of our total revenues for the company, that\u2019s number one. Number two, when you look at the breadth of the growth in the company in terms of net interest income growth you saw loan growth, you saw us take advantage of the fact that given the right back up we will invest it more in securities. We haven't invested this much in securities in a long time right even when that we say the backup in the first quarter. When you look at the non-interest or the fee revenues really across the board we saw growth with the exception of some of those areas that were affected by the back up in rates so there\u2019s a good story there. I don\u2019t necessarily think this is the end of the improvement in credit because the factors continue to -- that are driving the improvement in credit haven't bottomed down. And then I think it's likely that we\u2019ll continue to see some improvement in expenses. So when you put it all together, I don\u2019t think it's just one time if it was I\u2019d tell you and you could decide whether or not it would make sense, but the good news for us because of our diversified model we don\u2019t have to rely upon one or two specific areas to be able to make up because make up or decline in any business we\u2019ve seen declines in some of our businesses each quarter now for the last 14 quarters and we still have been able to grow whether or not we can do it in the third quarter I can\u2019t promise you that, but I sure do like our chances to continue to grow earnings over time.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "Got it.", "John G. Stumpf", "Tim is absolutely right in that, I mean we are actually focused around here on growth, and it comes from our basic operating philosophy around helping customers succeed financially. And when you\u2019re in 90 different businesses as Tim mentioned not every quarter would be a complete offset to one other one, but over time we believe we have the right business model, the right leaders, the right markets to continue to grow this company and we sure like our chances on that.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "Thank you very much guys.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thank you.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Thank you very much. How you guys doing? Just one follow-up question on the MSRs, you talked about you could see some sales; would these be material sales in MSRs I mean what level of MSRs would you like to hold?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "We\u2019re very comfortable with the level of MSR that we have today. Having said that from a risk management standpoint it's prudent to investigate the sale of any of the assets that you have on the books, whether it's MSRs or otherwise. I think to the extent that we would move forward to sell MSRs we would focus on those MSRs that tend to be to a customer that only has one product that mortgage that we service with the company; that would be where the primary focus would be. I don\u2019t necessarily think it would material because we don\u2019t think we have to do it, but it sure does make sense given the volatility in interest rates to look at all your assets and make sure that you know how to and can execute on sales before you\u2019d ever get to a position that you would have to do it.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah Paul think of it this way, I wouldn\u2019t make more of this than it is, I mean we have a very large and important servicing business. We love that business from time-to-time opportunistically we\u2019ll sell something and reposition, but we like the bounce and we like that business a whole lot.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "And then on the credit side, I believe your reserve ratio is down around 2%. What do you think you can take that down to with your improvement in credit and improvement in HPI?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "We don\u2019t have a target, it's a fair question but we don\u2019t have a target, it was 2.01% at the end of the quarter. It's going to be what it's going to be based upon the improvement in the underlying credit trends. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was below 2% the next quarter I mean that\u2019s a possibility. It could be a little bit higher, it could be a little bit lower, but there\u2019s not a specific target that we have because it's really just the results of their underlying credit performance.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. Hey, guys thank you very much.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks, good morning guys and congrats on a solid quarter.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you, Joe.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, Joe.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "I guess as you mentioned that the economic data continues to improve with last weeks employment report and the strengthening housing recovery and while you talked about a multiplayer effect, are you seeing much of a pick-up in activity yet at the customer level as well and when might we see this translate into stronger loan growth particularly on the commercial side.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, the primary area\u2019s that we\u2019re seeing and take a hold is on the consumer side. You saw our consumer loans, again we need to back out the impact of the liquidating portfolio but we saw auto growth, we saw credit card growth which was very nice. We\u2019re continuing to see growth in terms of this household formation that\u2019s out there and that allows us to continue to grow deposits, so all those are good trends. There\u2019s no question there\u2019s going to be a bit of a lag effect as it relates to stronger commercial loan growth. Our commercial loan growth again has been pretty strong, which is now the I think the 10th consecutive quarter that we -- wholesale in total has grown and certainly in certain segments and industries within the wholesale portfolio we\u2019re seeing some good growth, but my guess again it will be a quarter or so before we start to see a big pick-up.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "So you\u2019re not really seeing customers draw down cash at or really make more investments.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No. I wish they were but unfortunately not. When you look at line usage in the commercial side it's been pretty stagnant for that.", "John G. Stumpf", "And you\u2019re right Joe, that happens first. Yes \u2013 that\u2019s typically the first thing that happens.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "And then just on investment banking revenue is up strong from the first quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more about the drivers there and maybe if you could just give an update on the business in general and how it's progressing in market share gains and things like that?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah overall the business is performing very well, the primary drivers for the growth wasn\u2019t necessarily in any one specific product type within the business and it was very, very much focused on our existing customer base. The fees were up 40% year-over-year, most of that again was with our existing commercial and corporate customers. I think our market share at the end of the quarter ended up at about 5.8% which was fine. We\u2019re not running that business for any sort of market share, we\u2019re running that business to be able to be there for our customers when they need us and when you look at the growth in the business and the fact that it's primarily focused on those customers it's performing quite well.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah, Joe to add something to that, I make a lot of calls in that area on behalf of our team, and these are existing customers for the most part. They appreciate the skill set and the abilities we have in that business especially if we partner with our retail distribution platform. So we make a compelling offer and our long-term customers appreciate that added service that we have for them.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, Joe.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "Hi.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Mike.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Good morning, Mike.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "I am trying to get just a real simple answer and that is, I heard what you said John about the improving housing market and that was helpful, but the question is; are the benefits in the improving housing market already in the numbers of Wells Fargo and my Column A based on what you said are some headwinds the origination pipeline down 10% to 15% repurchase reserves are all pretty low gain on sale going down and the Column B or perhaps in tailwinds, expenses perhaps going down from the workout costs, in the mortgage platform, the MSRs and the credit. So which is greater; Column A or Column B? And John, in your opening remarks, you said, well, benefits \u2013 your grammatical tense was the present tense and I think Tim at one point said Well Fargo benefitted the past tense. So does Wells Fargo still benefit in their bottom line results from the improving housing market or is it all in the numbers?", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah, here's the way I look at that, Mike. When housing gets better, it's better for Americans, it's better for the country and that accrues \u2013 we had a commitment to residential real estate and commercial real estate for that matter in those companies, because that's what our customers want us to buy. I can't tell you if it's \u2013 what's going to happen in the next quarter, but I can tell you this. An improving housing market will benefit customers and us because we're at the end of the day a reflection of our customers. So the benefits are yet to come. It might come in different line items. You're right, if rates rise there will be less refinances. We've been there before, but it also means improved credits, it means improved confidence. Customers start small businesses. We're a big/small business bank. Environmental costs go away. So I would take that trade all day long in improving housing market even if it means less refinances because rates are rising at the same time, that's fine.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Mike, the only other thing I would add is I don't think you have enough columns on your sheet of paper. We have 90 different businesses, right? We are not just a \u2013 if we were just a mortgage company, then I think the columns and the items that you pointed out would have been absolutely spot on, right? But this is a portion of our business, it's a great business, terrific people, we're helping customers succeed all the time in that business, but we have 90 other \u2013 or 89 other businesses in this company that are continuing to grow and you can see not only this quarter but over the last year that many of the businesses have been growing not only as it relates to net interest income but also to noninterest income. So, again, who knows what's going to happen in the third quarter but over time this diversified model is very helpful when you have one business where revenues might be coming down.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "And if I can speak to our language, so I guess you'd say there's 90 horses pulling the stagecoach and as the mortgage horse is slowing down, potentially slows down although it's certainly been stronger for longer, which of those other 89 businesses do you think are most able to pick up the slack?", "John G. Stumpf", "All of them. It's not just one, Mike.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "That's what exciting, right? If there was just one, actually we'd be worried about it. But whether \u2013 it's a nice analogy. That would be quite a stagecoach that we would have but the mortgage horse has been a big strong horse, right? We've got 89 other horses that are going to be to grow. And again, just look at the numbers this quarter to get a feeling for \u2013 we called 10 to 12, there's even more as you pour through the numbers in terms of performance.", "John G. Stumpf", "We talked in last couple of quarters about how we think we have an opportunity in credit card. I mean we are seeing great increases there. Look at the Wealth, Brokerage and retirement business, now these are not all one horse offset the other horse but when you have a whole team out there, the key is keep the coach running and we like that diversity.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "And last follow-up, just in case the other [NII] businesses don't pick up the slack right away as JPMorgan said on its call earlier that you can't slow down a mortgage but a lag in the expense takeout. Can you just remind us of the expense flexibility that you have outside of mortgage?", "John G. Stumpf", "We still think there is opportunity on expenses here and I think Tim mentioned that earlier in the call. So as you mentioned on the mortgage side, first of all there is the commission base, so that happens immediately. And then we are very good at sizing the business based on what's going on. We've done that many times. But in other businesses we \u2013 for example, we started something called the neighborhood store with 6,200 stores. We opened that first one in Washington D.C. and that operates at 40% less costs of the same functionality. There are tons of opportunities like that; paperless ATM receipts and nickels and dimes in the corners that all add up at the end of the day in addition to the environmental costs.", "Michael Mayo - CLSA", "All right. Thank you.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thank you, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Good morning, guys.", "John G. Stumpf", "Good morning, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "I promise I'm not going to ask mortgage banking questions. First, there's been a lot of press around this issue of the kiosk branch that you're introducing, I think, in New York City. Could you talk about that a little bit and whether this signals some sort of broader experimentation with branch types throughout the network or is this something specific to New York?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, eventually is Washington D.C. but \u2013 so let me tell you first of all, we have about 6,200 stores and the stores have been relatively flat in numbers. And there is a lot of discussion today about in our industry whether stores are still relevant. We think they're enormously relevant even to our millennial customers. And store usage and channel usage frankly is based on many times age, affluence and activity. And when we talk with our customers, even the millennial visit our stores once every year or six months or sometime and places where they go to open their first account, it's where people go. If they can't, they'll go probably any place else and it's a place they take good money in if they come into a trust fund that runs out of whatever the case may be. But here's the key. As long as our customers tell us that destination distribution like a store is important, we're going to built it for them and we're going to have stores. Will they need them? Will they want them? And that's important to growing deposits, to selling products and services to them. If we ever get a time where they say it's not important, then we'll jump that way also. So since stores are important, how do you make them more efficient and how do you build them in a way that allows for the convenience they want, the availability they want but also under the cost structure that makes sense. The neighborhood store we had, it's about 1,000 square feet. During the daytime, it's a full functioning store. It happens to be paperless, it happens to have the cash there is contained within machines that can check down to the dollar. And after hours the [walls] fold in and it's an ATM vestibule. So you can get the best of both. This is a test and learn. We've done a lot of testing and learning around here and in many of those densely populated marketplaces, you can't rent a facility of 5,000 square feet. A 1,000 all you can get, so that makes it available to you. So if this works, we'll do more. It doesn't work, we've got nothing. This is only one test. We have lots of tests going on.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "But at this point, it's an additive strategy. It wouldn't be where you would take existing branches that are sort of \"more normal branches\" and change them to traditional additive strategy at this point?", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah, it's additive but it might be a replacement strategy for certain stores. In fact, some of what we're doing today is taking two stores and building a new one and consolidating into two depending on customer flows, depending on customer needs. We are a retailer, so most retailers that I respect are always looking at their distribution footprint and model but the long and the short of it is we believe in the store concept but \u2013 I mean when I first got in the industry, we had the operations in the second floor and the boardroom on the bottom floor, in the basement. We had to change since that time and still continue to change.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Am I right in assuming that the breakeven on these things is like weeks or a few months?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well it depends on the activity in the store and the activity with customers. Five years ago the breaking was very different than it's today, customers borrowed more.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "All right.", "John G. Stumpf", "It's a different margin on borrowing versus depositing. But I wouldn\u2019t say in weeks or months but it's about 40% reduction in cost is the same functionality, that\u2019s a big deal.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "All right. Second question is this, your improvement in cross-sell from 6 to 6.14 and your ongoing improvements in cross-sell, is this primarily one product, two products, I mean is there sort of still a quote, lead product you guys have that sort of lead the cross-sell?", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes, it's checking accounts. That\u2019s why when I wake up in the morning I get here, the first thing I look at is the checking account report from the day before. I love checking accounts, I dream about them. I just -- because \u2026", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "John, you\u2019ve been in the business too long, I am sorry.", "John G. Stumpf", "It's because it's the formational account for a consumer. And the second probably most important is mortgage, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re almost -- we\u2019re obsessive about that, about serving customers.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Yeah, and just finally one quick thing and I probably already know what the answer is but I have got to ask it anyway, given that there has been yet one more attempt at Glass Steagall, break them up, you obviously big, you\u2019re bigger now than you were before the financial crisis blah, blah, blah I mean are you -- I would assume that you would be in this group of break them up banks, and I guess my question is, what could you be broken up into?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, Nancy this is America, people are free to express their opinion, and that\u2019s one of the beauties of this country. And yeah from my perspective we're thoroughly in the real economy. I mean what we do is to serve customers. Small business, large business, commercial real estate customers, consumers and virtually everything we do has a customer on the other side of it. We take a deposit in, we don\u2019t put it into a vault and (indiscernible) we put it to work. We make consumer loans, commercial loans, small business loans, loans to ranchers and farmers and energy companies and that\u2019s what we do, and that\u2019s proprietary. I mean that\u2019s putting, because we have to manage those kinds of risks, I understand that. I don\u2019t understand how serving customers broadly and deeply including helping them with a public offering whether it be debt or equity, somehow it makes us riskier or weaker or puts depositors at risk more so than making a loan. But I understand that the dialogue, you got to realize the capital that\u2019s been raised, the discipline around risk of all kind is far different than it was just a few years ago. I am proud of this company and proud of what we do and I know that we are helping this economy to recover, to heal and we\u2019ll do all we can do that.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Thank you.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Andrew.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Good morning, guys.", "John G. Stumpf", "Good morning.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Just a couple of [tiki-tak] questions, first on expenses, environmental costs have come down significantly the last couple of quarters. Is there a lot more room to go from there, I know you had mentioned that, they were not at all behind us, but I seem that we won't go to zero on a lot of these, some of this will be ongoing costs when I\u2019m looking at your Page 13 on your slide deck, how much room should we really think about is left to go?", "John G. Stumpf", "I don\u2019t know the exact answer to your question Andrew. I think it's a fair question because as you point out we\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of progress over the last few quarters. I don\u2019t think, so if you just pick two items for example, foreclosed asset expenses which were $146 million in the second quarter, that doesn\u2019t feel to me to be the run rate that we would settle in. Could it go up, it could go up or could go down, but I think over time there still is some room for that to decline. And then also I think the contra revenue item that we had which was the MSR servicing and foreclosure cost impact. Again the primary driver there is continued foreclosure timelines in certain judicial foreclosure states, primarily New York and New Jersey and over time that will I think begin \u2013 we will continue to moderate. So, I think those in particularly probably little bit more room to run. But you\u2019re correct, the rate of increase is going to slow down.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Okay, okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then secondly, back to liquidity, just want a clarification, because you had mentioned in an earlier comment about how you may need to raise some additional liquidity. Is that related to the LCR or is that related to the consideration of other things in terms of the OLA additional bailing debt considerations that are out there? Because when we look at LCR, we have you guys in a pretty healthy range of 120 to 140 depending on how you calculate it. So I was just a little surprised by that comment.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I think that\u2019s \u2013 you hit the nail on the head with your last comment and that it's hard to calculate the answer when you don\u2019t really know what \u2013 that all the variables are going to be. We think that we have more than sufficient amount of liquidity be able to operate Wells Fargo, we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate that through some pretty significant downturn. The rules might change a little bit. If that\u2019s the case we have to make some adjustments to the balance sheet, if we do that. That\u2019s fine. We will adjust to that. But it's not that the onset of finalizing the Basel III LCR and any of the interpretation that might occur from our domestic regulators is not impacting the way that we\u2019re running the business today. Meaning that we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t have some money to satisfy that we can\u2019t lend to our customers or we can\u2019t invest in securities because we\u2019re too concerned about that and there is a lot of moving parts. And again, we\u2019re going to we are \u2013 we will comply with whatever the final rules are, we will do that in an appropriate timeframe. But it\u2019s not a limiting factor for the Company today.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Got it. And what is the constraining factor when we should think about excess liquidity and the ability to deploy more into securities or loans or what have you? What is the sense that\u2019s \u2026?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "It is economic growth and the rate of loan growth and when we think about the recovery, as we talked about, we continue to be in a recovery that had to adjust to a tremendous amount of headwinds and it's been from our perspective remarkably resilient, but our loan growth would be a lot stronger as we were at 3% GDP level or 4% GDP level, which is about what I think everybody expected a few years ago when we started to come out of the downturn it\u2019s primarily loan growth, less today in terms of investment, less today rates. That was a big limiting factor for us a year-ago and nine months ago and three months ago for that matter, less today for sure rates, because rates are more attractive today.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.", "John G. Stumpf", "And the beauty of it, borrowing does start, I mean that \u2013 those costs are already embedded. We already have those approved. I mean that\u2019s just all revenue then.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "All right. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Hey, Betsy.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hey, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Hey, good morning. Couple of questions. One on page 26, you got the PCI accretable yield slide and you indicated the weighted average life is 14.5 years there. So that\u2019s up from last quarter where I think it was like 12.3 or something like that. And I am just wondering what is behind driving that up?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "A couple of things. One is just that we have a general improvement in the underlying portfolio and the delinquency in the portfolio has come down little bit. So the expectation according to the model is that customers are going to stay in their homes longer. We could be \u2013 I mean it could be though that you could reach a point whereas you continue to see home values increasing, that it could reach a point where those customers maybe more comfortable and able to sell their homes or even to refinance and that would begin to bring the average life down. But I wouldn\u2019t read into that change any big change in our assumption during \u2013 like that is very variable on a quarter-to-quarter basis.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. But you are basically saying credit quality is improving and that\u2019s why the weighted average life is extending? ", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Do you have anything at all in there for prepays, or it\u2019s not rate related at all?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, we definitely do. I mean that's part of the \u2013 it's one of the important variables within the model. But again, personally I think that prepaid are going to accelerate over time as values continue to go up, but we haven't seen that yet in the performance level but I think logically it could.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And which would shorten duration and pull in the PCI a little bit faster?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Correct.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then secondly, HPI going up significantly in the most recent quarter, it's this level of housing value hold for the rest of the year. How much is that going to be impacting your loan growth? And I know the question's been asked a couple of different times but I guess the real question is, do you feel that the current value of housing price is in Q2's numbers or is there more to come from the HPI improvements that we've seen this quarter?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "We tend to use a lagged function and we tend to be a little bit more conservative. I mean we're not going to take for example the housing price, the 13% that John mentioned what we've seen year-over-year and assume that's going to continue forever, right? And so you got to be very careful with that. I think we've been and I think the entire industry and the market's been positively surprised at the level at which housing prices have \u2013 how resilient they've been, how much they've grown and the percentage that they've grown. So again, I think that we've seen some nice improvement and our expectation is that we're very positively leveraged to home prices. And so we could see some improvement from the results that you see here in the second quarter.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "I'm just thinking in particular about home equity, because that to me seems like the area where you should have some of the sharpest swings as HPI has gone up so much recently over the next couple of quarters. But I don't know if that's a fair assessment given\u2026?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Betsy, I think you're absolutely right and maybe using the word leverage is maybe even more appropriate there when you think about the impact to a home equity portfolio which the majority of our home equity portfolios are junior leans. To the extent that you got a portion of that that's above 100% home \u2013 increasing home values really, really impacts that portfolio.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "So are you seeing much in the demand and the origination pipeline for that product yet, or is it too early?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I think our home equity originations were up year-over-year but I don't think they were necessarily up significantly from the first quarter. It's a good product. It's underwritten very well today. It's one of the many products we provide. It's a slight uptick but it wasn't one of the drivers for the home equity \u2013 or our loan growth we would have called it out.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Chris.", "Chris Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Good morning, John. How are you?", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Chris.", "Chris Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Tim, I had a quick question for you. I'm going to go all the way back to the first question today and I can't promise what Nancy promised. It will be a mortgage question. When you look at the servicing side of the business and how it flows through the income statement, the servicing asset has \u2013 the MSR has been written up about $3 billion in the last couple quarters and yet the servicing income is still kind of stuck in that $300 million to $400 million range per quarter. So in order for that natural hedge to fully take hold, if indeed we see a material, and that's my assumption, but a material decrease in refinance activity, do you have to start lessening up on the hedge on the MSR for that to flow through to the income statement and more so than it has?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "If you wanted to create a natural hedge, you would have to reduce your hedge percentages and then when you're doing that, you would potentially create a lot more interest rate risks \u2013 not potentially, you would create a lot more interest rate risks for the company. And we just don't think that that's a prudent thing to do. So I think historically when the business was smaller than it is today, it might have been a little bit more \u2013 we might have more flexibility to do that. That doesn't really make sense to us today. So, our hedge ratios are relatively high, which is one of the reasons why you're not seeing one-for-one offset. There will be some benefit there's no question about that. And I think one of the key benefits of the servicing portfolio over time is that the quality of what you're servicing continues to increase because you continue to originate better quality mortgages that are going to pay for a longer period of time and you don't have as much foreclosure impact. I think that in terms of comparing our servicing results over the next few quarters with what we've experienced in the last few quarters, most of the reduction that you've seen has been related to foreclosure elongation and things like that and we're hopeful that that's going to dissipate. But I would not look for the MSR dollar-for-dollar offset and any reduction in revenues from the origination side of the business. There's some natural relation but it's not one-for-one.", "Chris Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "And just one quick follow-up. I think John had mentioned or I think both of you mentioned potential MSR sales going forward. And I think, John, you had mentioned \u2013 I don't want to put words in your mouth, but maybe there would be kind of one-off type portfolio similar to the reverse mortgage sale recently. Would the pickup paid portfolio be included as a one-off potential sale, in terms of MSRs?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, that one we own. I mean we own the asset there. So I wouldn't look for that area per se. I don' want to give guidance here, but I think what you should take away from this is that we like the MSR business. We think it's critical to \u2013 well, we not only like it because of the business itself but because of the cross-sell we do out of it. And that we will sell from time to time opportunistically. I think Tim mentioned that we might look at something that has a single product household kind of dynamic here, but we're always looking in all of our businesses is an opportunity here to monetize something that might be more valuable someone else to us, sure, we'll look at that. I won't go for a big change here.", "Chris Mutascio - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Right, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.", "Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer", "My question was asked. Thanks.", "John G. Stumpf", "Okay, thank you. Thank you much and I know we've run over time a little bit but thank you all for joining our call and we appreciate your interest and your coverage in Wells Fargo. See you next quarter.

In this call we will make forward-looking statements about specific income statement and balance sheet items and other measures of our future financial results and condition, including statements about future loss content of and cash flows from the legacy Wachovia impaired loan portfolios, expected credit losses and credit performance generally and in specific loan portfolios, the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, future levels of non-performing assets, future levels of capital, the timing and amount of expected cost savings related to the Wachovia merger and other initiatives, and our ability to generate revenue growth and earnings.", "Forward-looking statements give our expectations and they are not guarantees of future performance. They speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date.", "Actual results may differ significantly from expectations due to a number of factors, including the continued accuracy of our estimates used to determine purchase accounting adjustments on Wachovia\u2019s loan portfolio and other assets.", "There is no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover future credit losses especially if credit markets and unemployment do not stabilize. For discussion of factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today which includes the press release announcing our first quarter results and our 2008 annual report on Form 10-K both available on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov.", "In this call, we will also discuss our tangible comment equity and tangible comment equity ratio. For more information about these measures including a reconciliation of tangible comment equity to total equity, refer to the tangible comment equity table in our first quarter earnings press release which is accessible on our website, wellsfargo.com, by clicking on About Us, then Investor Relations, then Quarterly Earnings. We have also posted on our website a first quarter 2009 credit supplement that provides performance information for specific loan portfolios.", "I will now turn the call over to CFO, Howard Atkins.", "Howard Atkins", "Thanks Bob. I would like to focus my remarks on how Wells Fargo delivered such exceptional performance in our first full quarter as a New Wells Fargo despite the challenging environment.", "First, let us start with all the important record results we achieved in the quarter. We earned record net income of $3.05 billion in the quarter. Profits were $767 million higher after tax than any previous quarter in our Company\u2019s history. Profits of the quarter were a record even after $661 million in preferred dividends with net income available to common shareholders of $2.38 billion.", "We earned $21 billion in combined revenue driven by 16% year-over-year growth at legacy Wells Fargo to record quarterly revenue of $12.3 billion. Our organic revenue growth this quarter was driven by the same Wells Fargo business model that has consistently produced near double digit revenue growth for at least the last decade.", "The consistency of our revenue growth is also due to the fact that we did not participate in most of the problematic businesses and activities that have reduced the level and stability of revenue at many of our peers. As our peers are busy dealing with the problems from these activities and with replacing the loss revenue, we have been successfully gaining customers and market share that will add to revenue and earnings well into the future.", "Pretax pre-provision profit of $9.2 billion was a record and exceeded net charge offs by nearly $6 billion, demonstrating Wells Fargo\u2019s capacity to produce revenue net of expenses that provide a substantial earnings and capital cushion even if credit costs remain cyclically high.", "Our Company continued to benefit from the very strong mortgage environment. We originated $101 billion of mortgage loans, our highest level since 2003, including a record application month of $83 billion in March. While low interest rates are stimulating mortgage demand, we are picking up mortgage market share. Our mortgage originations doubled in the first quarter from the prior quarter compared with an average increase of about half that among our large peers.", "We generated record sales at legacy Wells Fargo, including record regional banking core product sales of $6.7 million up 17% and growth in consumer checking accounts up a net 6.8%. This sales performance helped produce record retail cross-sell of 5.8 products and wholesale cross-sell in 6.4 products in the first quarter at legacy Wells Fargo.", "One of the reasons for acquiring Wachovia was to apply this cross-sell competency to Wachovia\u2019s customer base in Wachovia\u2019s footprint. Overall, we estimate that Wachovia\u2019s cross-sell is currently roughly three quarters that of Wells Fargo.", "The revenue synergies from increasing Wachovia\u2019s cross-sell offered huge opportunities for future revenue and profit growth. Wachovia continued to lead the industry and service quality in the first quarter. In February, Wachovia was once again recognized by the American customer satisfaction index for being number one in customer service among large peers for the eighth-year in a row.", "As we have said since the time of the merger announcement, this is an area where there is a great opportunity for Wells Fargo to leverage Wachovia\u2019s proven expertise to better serve our customers throughout our franchise.", "We posted a net interest margin of 4.16%, the best among large bank peers which averaged 3.1%. Wells Fargo has always had among the highest net interest margins whereas Wachovia was generally closely to the industry average. Despite the expected net interest margin reduction mathematically caused by the combination of our two companies, the fact that we are still best in class is a testament to our business model and the strength of legacy Wells Fargo\u2019s net interest margin level.", "Our higher margin reflects many factors but most notably is due to the sizable base of non-interest bearing and low cost checking and savings accounts in our overall deposit mix. We now have a much broader geographic footprint with the ability to attract deposits not only through our traditional banking and mortgage businesses but now through a nationwide retail brokerage platform.", "We aligned deposit pricing across Wells Fargo and Wachovia at the beginning of this year and we are seeing better deposit performance at Wells Fargo interest rates that we had originally assumed. During the quarter $34 billion of high rate CDs from Wachovia matured and we retained over $19 billion of these deposits in lower cost checking and savings accounts in addition to lower rate CDs.", "Of the Wachovia CD customers we did not retain, over half were non-relationship CD-only customers from whom we were less likely to generate future cross-sell opportunities. While we will continue to see the Wachovia high rate CDs mature, this early experience gives us greater confidence in our ability to retain balances and lower rates as well as build business with customers interested in long term relationships.", "We continue to manage expenses in a disciplined fashion. Our combined first quarter efficiency ratio of 56% was roughly in line with legacy Wells Fargo\u2019s prior ratios even though the legacy Wachovia had a higher cost structure given its business mix and the effect of higher payout businesses like retail brokerage and asset management.", "This cost management success helps demonstrate our commitment to tight expense discipline even as we incur merger related expenses. As previously indicated, we expect to achieve $5 billion on annual run rate savings from consolidation and additional savings from expense initiatives during the remainder of 2009.", "The record earnings in the quarter were driven by the same factors that have consistently produced profit at Wells Fargo, a track record of profitable sales growth and industry leading operating margins. The first quarter results were great example of the power of operating a diversified business model as Wells Fargo has successfully done for many years.", "We have over 80 businesses pulling the stagecoach as we say. In the financial services sector, money never declines. It just moves based on customer and economic lifecycles. By successfully operating a diversified business model, we make sure that we are there to meet all of our customers\u2019 needs as money moves through those cycles.", "Some examples of this in the first quarter include the following. We helped 450,000 customers to finance the mortgage. This is almost doubled the number of customers who did so with us only a quarter ago. While lower interest rates helped increase demand, a near record increase in mortgage originations was produced by thousands of Wells Fargo mortgage specialists working with homeowners across the United States, including over 5,000 operations team members hired to process the volume increase.", "For those customers who refinanced, they will have more money in their pocket each month which will benefit them and the overall economy. In that case, we are there to help them with transaction oriented products like credit and debit cards. While first quarter results reflected the strength in the origination side of the mortgage business in a low rate environment. The value and earnings from our $2.1 trillion servicing portfolio would normally be expected to increase if originations were to slow down in a higher rate environment.", "That balance is by design, not by accident. Our origination and servicing businesses tend to be natural offsets and our origination revenues and mortgage servicing rights value move accordingly as they did this quarter.", "During the first quarter, mortgage interest rates declined. Prepayment speeds went up and refinancing increased. As a result, we wrote down our MSR servicing asset, the ratio of loan service for others during the first quarter to 74 basis points the lowest level of capitalized servicing since the last refinancing boom in 2003.", "The MSR asset write down accurately reflects the market conditions and future prepayment expectations and as previously mentioned, is countercyclical to our origination business.", "Given the uncertainty in this economy, some consumers are spending less and saving more. Our diversified model, with its expanded national banking and retail brokerage platform helped us benefit from this shift as we increased deposits from our existing customers at legacy Wells Fargo and through new customer growth throughout our franchise, both contributing to our increase and total core deposits of $10.8 billion in the quarter.", "Also consumer checking accounts were up a net 6.2% for the overall Company and up a net 6.8% at legacy Wells Fargo. California continued to be the fastest growing state for legacy Wells Fargo deposits with record consumer checking accounts up a net 8.9% over 40% above the rate of which accounts grew on average across Wells Fargo\u2019s coast-to-coast markets. Again, this demonstrates the benefit of our powerful presence in this important market and the benefit of our geographic diversification.", "Trading revenues this quarter were $787 million. Wells Fargo has always managed the customer centric capital markets and foreign exchange business, a business where volumes actually expand during periods of market turmoil especially for highly rated counterparties like Wells Fargo.", "This platform was managed very differently than larger investment banks and large commercial banks with international investment banking in capital market platform. We are not dependent on proprietary trading type activities but instead our focus on providing solutions to customers that enables us to earn fees while limiting our risk taking activities. We offer products like interest rate protection, foreign exchange services and access for capital markets all with our relationship perspective.", "Demand for these types of services increased during periods of market volatility as it did in the first quarter. Meeting this need has always been a core profitable activity at Wells Fargo and the addition of the capabilities in Wachovia team members and customer base only expanded this revenue opportunity, roughly two thirds of the $787 million trading revenue this quarter was for meeting those customer needs.", "The remaining one third related largely to position design to hedge portfolio risks and other proprietary positions many of which were unwound during the quarter. There are obviously many other examples, but the point is that our diversified model is designed to produce revenue and earnings in all economic environments as it did this quarter.", "The power of this diversified business model is even greater now after the Wachovia merger. With Wachovia we have doubled the customer base where we can apply the Wells Fargo model. We now serve one in three US households and we began cross-selling to Wachovia customers including mortgages in the first quarter.", "Wachovia\u2019s product set also creates new opportunities for us and helps to diversify further our revenue and earnings sources. For example, trust and investment management fees in the first quarter were approximately 11% of combined total revenues compared with 5% at legacy Wells Fargo. During the first quarter as a combined Company, Wachovia has exceeded our expectations, contributing 41% of our combined revenues.", "Let me now turn to credit. In connection with the Wachovia merger at year end, we were required on the GAAP to identify and write down Wachovia\u2019s high risk loan portfolios. We identified various loan portfolios that we considered impaired which initially totaled approximately $94 billion or roughly 20% of Wachovia\u2019s loans. We initially wrote them down by $37.2 billion through purchase accounting adjustments directly to equity representing our best estimate of the losses in these portfolios over their remaining estimated lives.", "In general, those pools have lost probabilities of at least 70%. In the future, unless there is a future deterioration that might cause our estimates of the lost content to change, this should not be a P&L charge for credit losses on this entire portfolio since all of the estimated charge offs over the estimated life of those loans were already taken at the December 31st, 2008 close.", "In the first quarter of 2009 as required in the purchase accounting, we refined our preliminary purchase accounting adjustments based on additional information regarding the portfolios and their environment at year end.", "This review resulted in $2.8 billion increase in the estimated life of loan credit losses on the impaired portfolio due to an increase in the sizes of the pool of loans subject to purchase accounting write downs and some deterioration in the impaired portfolio. This was largely offset by $1.8 billion increase in expected cash flows on the impaired portfolio due to the increase and size of the portfolio combined with higher expected payments and earlier expected resolutions.", "As a result of writing down Wachovia\u2019s higher risk portfolios and assuming no further deterioration, we believe that the remaining balance of the impaired portfolio with $58 billion in total had virtually no remaining loss content at year end. To repeat, the estimated life of loan loss content related to the designated impaired portfolio was removed from our balance sheet at year end and we are confident that as long as there is no additional deterioration, future losses have been eliminated.", "Lastly, by definition, the non-impaired portfolio of Wachovia loans about $375 billion in balances, represent loans with an average probability of default substantially lower than the loans that were written down at close.", "Any provision for charge offs in this portfolio will be expensed to the income statement as usual. While the non-impaired Wachovia loan portfolios have lower risk. They do not have zero risk of course. We expect losses in the non-impaired portfolios to increase over a period of time as new losses emerge before recoveries occur.", "Overall, the remainder of these non-impaired Wachovia loans should experience lower loss rates over the cycle than most broadly mixed loan portfolios because the rest of Wachovia\u2019s loan portfolios, they were not already written down, by definition, have much lower loss content.", "Nonperforming loans increased $3.7 billion from year end, about half of the increase in nonperforming loans at Wells Fargo and Wachovia in the fourth quarter. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans increased 46 basis points from year end, about a third less than the average NPL increase of 63 basis points among our large peers.", "The increase from the year end was not a surprise to us and in part reflects the fact that as a result of purchase accounting write downs Wachovia\u2019s nonperforming loans were only $97 million at year end. At March 31st, 2009, the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 1.25%, the lowest ratio among our large peers.", "It is important to remember that not all nonperforming loans or nonperforming assets result in a loss. More than 90% of first quarter\u2019s $12.6 billion of nonperforming assets is secured. We also create nonperforming assets when we take actions to keep people in their homes, a process ultimately beneficial to the residential real estate market.", "We have been at work for sometime reducing higher risk loans of both companies; approximately $119 billion of consumer loans within the combined loan portfolio represent loans where we have exited the business or are running off old portfolios. These would include legacy Wells Fargo indirect auto, a portfolio we began reducing nearly two years ago, indirect home equity which we also exited almost two years ago. Pick-a-Pay option loans which Wachovia stopped originating early last year, and which was subject to purchase accounting write downs and has benefited from our success in modifying loans.", "Additionally, we have focused on further reducing certain higher risk portions of Wachovia\u2019s commercial real estate division\u2019s portfolio. In total, these portfolios have been reduced $45 billion or about 21% since June 30th, 2008 through write downs, runoff, or modification including a $4.5 billion reduction in the first quarter.", "Because we have been reducing credit exposure for some of these higher risk portfolios, growth in loan losses will be more moderate and would otherwise be the case and the peak in our credit losses would be expected to occur earlier. In addition to the reduction in these higher risk non-strategic loan portfolios, trading assets were also reduced by $8.4 billion in the first quarter.", "The first quarter allowance for credit losses totaled $23 billion including a $1.3 billion credit reserve bill. Our $23 billion credit reserve was 2.9% of total non-impaired loans and over two times non-accrual loans. Our allowance is $10 billion higher than our first quarter charge offs annualized. The allowance covers 12 months of estimated losses for all consumer portfolios and at least 24 months of estimated losses were all commercial and commercial real state portfolios.", "The allowance coverage considers the current economic environment, the impact of our de-risking and the performance of the non-impaired loan balances. It also incorporates expectations on both nonperforming assets and charge offs over the coverage period being measured.", "So, there are two key takeaways from a credit perspective. First, the actions we took at the close of the Wachovia acquisition to write down all higher risk assets significantly improved the risk profile of the Company\u2019s loan and securities portfolios relative to what it would have been and relative to our large bank peers as we entered 2009.", "Second, a $23 billion credit reserve fully took into account expected economic deterioration through March 31st, 2009 and as just stated, fully covered 12 months of projected losses on all consumer portfolios and at least 24 months on all commercial and commercial real estate portfolios for both banks. Our reserve adequacy analysis reflects estimated losses that will emerge on both performing and nonperforming loans.", "Let me conclude with a few important remarks about capital. Our total common equity ratio or TCE ratio at March 31st was 3.28% up from 2.86% a quarter ago. During the quarter, tangible common equity reached $41 billion up $4.5 billion from December 31st, 2008. About $1 billion of the increase was from retained earnings and $3.3 billion was from improvement in other comprehensive income, including improvements in markets as well as a $2.8 billion after tax improvement in other comprehensive income related to FSP FAS157-4.", "As described in our press release, FSP FAS157-4 had no material impact on earnings in the quarter. Our reported TCE of 3.28% as well as TCE to risk weighted assets of 3.83% also includes the upfront write downs charge to equity related to Wachovia\u2019s impaired loan portfolio. The $40 billion of SOP03-3 non-accretable difference from the Wachovia merger is the equivalent of approximately 190 basis points of additional tangible common equity. It is important to recognize that purchase accounting write downs do not permanently reduced capital ratios. While capital is initially reduced, TCE will eventually rise to exactly where it would have been had the charge offs been accounted for over time instead of all upfront.", "Stated differently, by taking the write downs right away, earnings going forward will be higher than would have been the case if the charge offs we have provided out of earnings each quarter. The negative of purchase accounting write downs is that it reduces capital right away. The benefit is that future earnings may be higher, more reliable, and less volatile.", "More importantly comparing point in time capital ratios among companies is not taking to accounts the rate at which a company may be organically building capital. Stated differently, we believe the company that is building capital to retain earnings at a high and consistent rate like Wells Fargo is a more strongly capitalized bank and a bank with the same point in time capital ratios that is losing money or has volatile earnings.", "There are at least three significant and unique factors that drive Wells Fargo\u2019s internal capital generation. First and foremost, our diversified business model and better operating margins have produced above-peer revenue growth. As indicated earlier, pretax pre-provision profit in the first quarter was $9.2 billion, almost $6 billion higher than quarterly charge offs.", "Second, the Wachovia acquisition will produce meaningful synergies that will further enhance internal capital generation. While our eyes are clearly wide open about taking on more assets at a time when the economic environment is weak. Revenue synergies are already emerging and could be substantial, just as they were up on the combination of Wells Fargo and Norwest, and we expect $5 billion of annual expense savings from the completion of the integration which will begin to emerge starting in the second quarter of this year.", "And finally, as previously indicated, we have already taken significant risk out of the companies combined loan portfolio and balance sheet which should moderate credit losses going forward and lead to an earlier peak than would otherwise be the case.", "While it is too early to call a turn in credit and indeed credit could worsen before it eventually improves. Once credit does clearly turn, the potential return of capital embedded in the allowance for credit losses could be substantial.", "As we have said, the best way to grow capital is to earn it and that is what we are focused on throughout the Company. With the recently announced, 85% reduction in our common stock dividend even more of our earnings will be retained starting in the second quarter. The dividend reduction itself is the equivalent of adding about $5 billion in capital each year to earnings.", "In summary, it has truly been a remarkable quarter for our Company. Our diversified business model drove a record $3 billion in profit for shareholders and demonstrated once again an ability to create sustainable growth through all cycles, a very much what we have been telling you throughout this credit crisis. While of course we still operate in a challenging economic environment, it is worth repeating some of our accomplishments this quarter.", "Record legacy Wells Fargo revenue up 16%, record pretax pre-provision profit of $9.2 billion, our best mortgage origination quarter since 2003, industry-leading net interest margin of 4.16%, 31% growth annualized in consumer checking and savings deposits, higher capital ratios and strengthened reserves and significant credit extended to US taxpayers. The New Wells Fargo is off to a very powerful start. Thank you for your interest in our Company.

Thank you for calling into the Wells Fargo Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Review Prerecorded Call. Before we talk about our second-quarter results, we need to make the standard securities law disclosure.", "In today's call we will make forward-looking statements about specific income statement and balance sheet items and other measures of future results of operations and financial condition, such as statements about credit quality and future credit losses generally.", "Examples of forward-looking statements made in today's call include the expectation that earnings asset growth in second quarter 2007 will increase net interest income and reduce net interest margin; the expectation that losses in the home equity portfolio will be higher but manageable throughout 2007; the expectation that actions taken with respect to the bond portfolio late in second quarter 2007 will add to third quarter 2007 earnings but reduce the leverage ratio; and the belief that recent regulatory guidelines issued for sub prime lending will not have a significant impact on Wells Fargo Financial's operation or on our credit losses or earnings.", "Forward-looking statements give our expectations about the future, they are not guarantees, and results may differ from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date.", "For a discussion of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to our SEC filings including the 8-K filed today, which includes the press release announcing our second quarter results, and to our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and to the information incorporated into those documents.", "Now I will turn the review over to our Chief Financial Officer, Howard Atkins.", "Howard Atkins", "Thanks, Bob. Wells Fargo produced another very strong quarter despite the challenges the industry has been facing this year. Once again, earnings per share grew 10% to a record $0.67 per share from $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2006. This is the 17th quarter out of the past 20 that we have grown earnings per share at a double-digit rate.", "Achieving double-digit growth in the current environment is difficult in any industry, not just banking, but the diversity of our revenue sources once again differentiated us from the rest of the industry. Results were driven by an ideal combination of double-digit revenue growth, positive operating leverage and relatively stable credit quality. Business performance was strong and well balanced across our broadly diverse business segments with most of our 80 plus consumer and commercial businesses producing double-digit earnings or revenue growth, or both.", "Total revenue in the second quarter increased 13% from a year ago, the largest quarterly revenue increase in the last two years. Businesses that generated double-digit year-over-year revenue growth included asset management, business direct, capital markets, corporate trust, credit and debit cards, global remittance services, home equity, consumer finance, insurance, international, personal credit management, real estate brokerage and wealth management.", "Operating leverage, once again, was positive with expenses increasing 11%, 2 percentage points below our 13% revenue growth. Virtually all of the year-over-year expense growth was directly or indirectly related to stronger sales in revenue. During the past year we have opened 99 new regional banking stores and 20 new offices within and outside our traditional footprint to serve existing and new commercial relationships.", "In the process we've added over 4,000 new team members, up 3% from a year ago, largely sales and service professionals. Sales commissions and related compensation increased in many of our fee-based businesses such as insurance, wealth management and real estate brokerage, all of which had particularly strong revenue growth year-over-year.", "Non-personnel expenses were relatively flat and declined in some categories, reflecting our ongoing discipline in containing expenses that don't directly add to revenue growth. Operating margins remained strong. We continue to have the highest net interest margin among our peers at 4.89%, up 13 basis points from a year ago.", "After having sold all of our lower yielding ARMs and securities over a year ago, when long-term interest rates were substantially lower than today, we began to invest again in longer-term securities late in the second quarter of 2007 as long-term interest rates rose substantially, adding approximately $30 billion in securities at attractive yields, substantially higher than the yields at which we sold our lowest yielding ARMs and long-term securities between mid 2004 and mid 2006.", "About half of the recently added securities were in the mortgage company, which periodically uses mortgage-backed securities to hedge the interest rate risk in the mortgage servicing portfolio. The additional assets are expected to increase net interest income growth, but the higher average earning asset growth is likely to reduce net interest margin in the third quarter.", "At 1.82% our return on assets after all expenses and credit costs remained one of the highest among large banks and improved 11 basis points from the second quarter of 2006 despite the increase in charge-offs from a year ago. At 19.6% our return on equity remained one of the highest in the industry reflecting our double-digit earnings growth and our focus on achieving high risk-adjusted returns in all of our business activities.", "Reflecting the breadth and balance of our business model both our commercial and consumer businesses contributed to these consistently strong results. Let me give you some key details.", "First, our wholesale banking. Our wholesale and commercial banking group, which serves primarily middle market customers and select niches in the large corporate market, had another record quarter. Net income grew 13% from a year ago, driven by 20% revenue growth. Growth in commercial loans and business deposits was strong as was growth in fee-based businesses such as insurance, capital markets, real estate brokerage and asset management.", "Wholesale banking group's average loans grew by 16% year-over-year and 18% annualized linked quarter. Asset-based lending, real estate, international and specialized financial-services, which include our capital markets activities and relationships with Fortune 500 companies, all experienced double-digit alone growth.", "Average commercial and commercial real estate loans, which included commercial loans in our wholesale segment as well as commercial loans in other segments such as small-business, increased 12% from the second quarter of 2006 and 15% annualized on a linked quarter basis.", "Commercial and commercial real estate loans have increased for 15 consecutive quarters and have grown at a double-digit rate for 11 consecutive quarters. Wholesale banking group's average core deposits were up $18 billion from the second quarter of 2006, which included certain funds that were previously swept into non-deposit products.", "Including only the growth in these funds post conversion to deposits, wholesale's average core deposits were up 32%. This growth was the result of higher balance growth from existing customers and new relationships, primarily in corporate banking, and deposits from international customers doing business in the United States.", "Eastdil Secured, our real estate brokerage and investment banking company, had a record quarter with revenue and income more than doubling from the first quarter of 2007. During the quarter, Eastdil advised on over $65 billion of real estate debt and equity transactions and continued to earn fees as the advisor to Blackstone Group in its $39 billion acquisition of Equity Office Properties Trust.", "The international group had double-digit revenue and earnings growth compared to the second quarter of 2006. Despite historically low volatility, the foreign exchange group arranged almost $13 billion in transactions per day in the second quarter up 10%. We have one of the largest foreign exchange sales operations in the country with centers in San Francisco, New York, Minneapolis and 11 other markets, offering pricing to our commercial, wealth management and retail customers in over 100 currencies.", "The wholesale services group continue to be a leader in technology by becoming the first major US financial services company to offer mobile service for medium and large businesses, providing access to information about their accounts and transaction activities on mobile devices. By making it easier for our customers to do business with us we continue to earn more of their business.", "Through the first half of 2007, we have already received over 20% more checks through our Check 21 solutions, including our award-winning Desktop Deposit service, than we did the entire year of 2006 and active Commercial Electronic Office portal users were up 29% from 2006, and customers now initiate and receive more payments electronically than through checks.", "The Asset Management Group, which is responsible for managing and administering a total of $606 billion in client assets, had record results with double-digit growth in revenue, earnings and assets under management. Assets under management were up 17% from second quarter of 2006. Wells Fargo Advantage Funds, our mutual fund business, grew assets by 20% from a year ago and ended the quarter with $134 billion in fund balances.", "This growth was driven by strong fund performance and new balances. Over half of the Wells family of mutual funds were in the top two Lipper Performance quintiles. Total Wells Fargo trust and investment management fees grew 24% from the second quarter of 2006.", "Let me now turn to community banking. Our Community Banking Group, comprised of regional banking, wealth management, mortgage banking and retail internet, had another strong quarter with 11% revenue growth and net income up 14%. Regional banking had a great quarter with record cross sell and improving customer experience scores.", "The average retail bank household had 5.4 products with Wells Fargo, a new record, up from five products a year ago and up from three products in 1998. 21% of our retail customers had over eight products with us, our long-term goal, up from 12% five years ago and in our top region 30% of our customers had over eight products with us.", "During the second quarter core product sales increased 9% from the prior year on a comparable basis to a total of $4.79 million sales. Platform banker FTEs increased 7% during the same time period.", "California continues to be one of our fastest growing states with a 14% increase in core product sales from the second quarter of 2006 on a comparable basis. Sales of Wells Fargo Packages, which include a checking account and at least three other products such as a debit card, credit card, savings account or home equity loan, were up 21% from the second quarter of 2006 and purchased by 66% of new checking account customers.", "Our success in selling and increasing usage of our credit and debit cards among our customers increased card fees by almost $100 million or 24% from the second quarter of 2006. At quarter end 36% of our retail bank customer consumer households had a Wells Fargo credit card, up from 34% a year ago and up from 24% five years ago.", "Purchase volume on these cards was up 18% from a year ago and average balances were up 21%. 91% of our consumer checking account customers had a debit card, up from 85% five years ago, and purchase volume increased by 13% from a year ago.", "Average core deposits of $301 billion included certain funds that were previously swept into non-deposit products. Including only the growth in these funds from the date of their conversion to deposits, or only deposits that were new to Wells Fargo, average core deposits grew 11% from a year ago and 14% annualized on a linked quarter basis.", "Average mortgage escrow deposits were up $5.8 billion from the second quarter of 2006 and up $2.8 billion from the first quarter of 2007. Excluding mortgage escrow balances, total average core deposits grew 12% from the second quarter of 2006 and 11% annualized on a linked quarter basis.", "Average retail core deposits, which exclude wholesale banking and mortgage escrow deposits, were up 6% from a year ago and 8% annualized on a linked quarter basis. Consumer checking accounts were up a net 4.9% from last year and small-business checking accounts were up a net 4.4% from last year.", "California continued to be our fastest growing market with checking accounts up a net 6%. This is the eighth consecutive quarter where net new accounts in California exceeded the average across our footprint.", "While we maintained one of the highest ratios of non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits among large banks in the United States, growth in interest-bearing checking and savings accounts and consumer CDs continue to exceed the growth in non-interest-bearing accounts, a trend that is consistent with the national monetary aggregates.", "Small business continues to be one of our best opportunities for growth. Sales of store-based business solutions were up 17% from last year on a comparable basis and sales of Wells Fargo Business Services Packages, which include a business checking account and at least three other business products such as a business debit card, business credit card, business savings account or business loan or line of credit, were up 41%. These strong sales results increased our cross sell to our business banking households to 3.4, up from 3.1 a year ago.", "Bank loans to small businesses, loans less than $100,000 on our business direct platform, grew 18% from the second quarter of 2006. We continue to focus on delivering a great experience for our customers and measuring our progress through 50,000 store-based customer surveys a month, over 1.8 million surveys to date. For customers transacting at the teller line, welcoming and wait time scores improved 22% and customer loyalty scores have improved 11% from the second quarter of 2006.", "Our Wealth Management Group once again had a strong quarter with 17% revenue growth and 23% earnings growth from a year ago. Revenue from brokerage increased 31% and earnings were up 91% from a year ago, driven by an increase in productivity from our financial consultants.", "This productivity lift helped brokerage assets under administration reach record levels, up 19% from the second quarter of 2006. WellsTrade, our online brokerage service, introduced new pricing during the first quarter which offers 100 commission free online trades per year for Wells Fargo PMA customers. Since the new pricing in February, new account openings have increased almost 100% over the same period last year.", "Wells Fargo continues to be a leader in online banking. At quarter end we had 9.3 million active online customers, up 17% from a year ago. 63% of all Wells Fargo consumer checking account customers are now active online customers. We had 5.3 million bill pay customers, up 32% from a year ago. We had 907,000 active online small-business customers, up 19% from a year ago.", "Internet sales continue to be an important channel for overall sales growth with consumer product sales up 36%, consumer checking accounts up 30%, consumer savings accounts up 40%, and consumer credit products up 16% from the second quarter of 2006.", "Mortgage applications in the second quarter were running at relatively high levels, up 6% from a year ago. Despite the increase in mortgage rates from last year, mortgage refi applications were up 24% from a year ago. At $68 billion purchase mortgage applications were close to the $71 billion in purchase applications taken during the home buying season last spring.", "Mortgage applications in the second quarter were about the same as the high volume of applications taken in the first quarter of 2007 and the application pipeline at the end of the second quarter of $56 billion was also roughly the same as the unclosed pipeline at the end of the first quarter.", "Mortgage originations were up 18% from the first quarter with most of the growth in the retail channel. The mortgage servicing portfolio continued to grow as it has for 46 consecutive quarters, despite ups and downs in interest rates and origination activity. Our owned servicing portfolio was $1.4 trillion at quarter end, up 30% from a year ago, about 11% due to the servicing portfolio acquired from Washington Mutual last year. Gross servicing fees of $1 billion were up 23% from a year ago, but were down 4% on a linked quarter basis primarily because of the sale of $1.4 billion in excess servicing rights.", "Excess servicing essentially represents an interest-only strip above the normal amount of the traditional servicing fee. The sale was undertaken at about breakeven to further reduce the interest rate risk in the servicing portfolio.", "Mortgage banking non-interest income was $689 million, down $101 million from first quarter. The impact of higher interest rates on the value of MSRs, net of hedging costs, was a $225 million net loss. The net gain on mortgage loan origination and sale activities was positively impacted by higher gain on sale margins during the quarter and also included a $135 million increase in the fair value of servicing associated with mortgage loans held for sale at quarter end.", "The anticipatory actions we took in February to further strengthen our residential real estate underwriting standards, and some pricing improvements on these loans in the second quarter, resulted in only a $35 million of revenue reduction on non-prime loans reflected in net gains on mortgage loan origination sales activities, compared to $90 million in revenue reduction taken in the first quarter. Total non-prime residential real estate secured originations were down $2.7 billion from the second quarter of 2006.", "Revenue at our consumer finance company, Wells Fargo Financial, increased 10% from a year ago driven by a 14% increase in loans. Growth in revenue and loans was somewhat more moderate than in prior periods as we began shifting several quarters ago toward the lower risk end of the spectrum on credit products we offer in our auto segment.", "Let me now shift to credit quality. Overall credit quality was in line with our expectations. Total credit losses were stable in the quarter at $720 million compared with $715 million in the first quarter and $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Loss rates declined slightly from 0.90% of average loans in the first quarter to 0.87% in the second quarter.", "Total non-performing assets were also relatively flat at $2.71 billion or 0.79% of loans in the second quarter compared with $2.67 billion or 0.82% of loans in the first quarter. Our non-performing loan portfolio continued to have relatively low loss potential, based on the high percentage of consumer real estate and auto secured loans, where we take an initial write down to estimated net realizable value as the loan is transferred to non-performing status.", "Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, excluding insured and guaranteed Ginnie Mae balances, declined by $43 million or 4% from first quarter and were down 6% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2006. As I've done in prior quarters, I will provide additional credit metrics on our major loan portfolios, but first, I want to highlight some areas where we have minimal exposure and have proactively taken steps to reduce our risk and enhance our credit performance.", "We do not retain any credit residuals on any of the prime or non-prime mortgage loans we sell or securitize. A small portion of mortgage loans sold is subject to early payment default risk. In the second quarter, we added $35 million to our repurchase reserve for estimated early payment default on all previously sold mortgages.", "While we do not retain the credit risk on the majority of our $1.4 trillion residential mortgage-servicing portfolio serving $10 million loans, we closely monitor the credit performance of the entire portfolio. Almost 90% of the mortgage loans we service are for prime customers. We value and price our prime and sub prime servicing based on expected repayment performance so that we are properly compensated for the added work related to potentially higher delinquency in the sub prime portfolios.", "We also price servicing based on the origination channel with better credit performance in our retail originations versus correspondent wholesale channels. While delinquencies and foreclosures are increasing, only 0.56% of our servicing portfolio -- in other words less than 1% is in foreclosure, which is below the industry average. We work closely with our servicing customers to try and keep them in their homes and work with national industry groups to promote and encourage customers to contact their lenders with possible problems.", "We have very little ARM reset risk across our loan and servicing portfolios. The bulk of the first mortgages, we originate are sold to investors. The bulk of any mortgages we retain are either relationship ARMs where the customer typically has substantial deposit balances and/or multiple products with us, or in our consumer finance business debt consolidation mortgages where the borrower's debt service is not increased by the mortgage loan. In both cases our ARM reset risk and credit exposure generally is minimal and much less than the industry overall.", "Less than 15% of our total ARM loans held on our balance sheet are scheduled to reset in the next 18 months. We have never offered or retained negative am or option ARMs with lower initial teaser rates, which is where the greatest risk exists for other providers in the industry.", "In our home equity and home mortgage businesses, we have further tightened correspondent and broker underwriting requirements, primarily reducing stated income and reduced documentation programs. We also discontinued purchasing sub prime loans from correspondents at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage during the quarter.", "We have negligible direct exposure to hedge funds. Lending directly to private equity sponsors is immaterial and not a strategic focus of our business. Borrowers owned by private equity firms are primarily financed through our asset-based or specialized lending units. These loans constitute less than 2% of our total loans. We have consciously avoided participating in high profile or controversial financings of this type.", "Most of our non-prime loans are originated and held at Wells Fargo Financial. Financial has two principal consumer credit portfolios -- auto and real estate. We continue to see an improvement in the credit performance of our $28 billion auto portfolio with net charge-offs down $42 million from the first quarter and down $88 million from the third quarter 2006 peak. 90 days past due continue to improve and were down 25% from the first quarter and are down 37% from the fourth-quarter peak.", "While the actions we have taken to improve collections capacity and efficiency drove this improved performance, the auto industry typically experiences seasonal declines in credit performance in the second half of the year. And we will carefully monitor our delinquency and loss performance and continue to adjust our auto loan origination and collection process as necessary.", "Over 70% of the auto portfolio had a FICO score above 620. The size of our auto portfolio was essentially unchanged from last quarter reflecting tightening of account acquisition strategies to reduce loan volume in the higher risk tiers. Nearly 80% of new originations in the second quarter had FICO scores above 620.", "At quarter end, Wells Fargo Financial had $22 billion in US-based real estate secured debt consolidation loans. This portfolio has performed better than the rest of the industry's non-prime mortgage portfolios because of the nature of the product, the type of customers who buy this product as well as the long-standing discipline with which these loans have always been underwritten and managed at Wells Fargo.", "These loans are for debt consolidation purposes, not for the purchase of a home. This means our customers are not incurring significant new financial obligations and in fact their monthly payments are typically lower than they were prior to taking out the debt consolidation loan. 96% of this portfolio is in a first-lien position.", "Wells Fargo Financial does not do any interest only, stated income, option ARMs or negative amortizing loans. All loans are originated by Wells Fargo financial team members we do not use any brokers or correspondents in this business. Wells Fargo Financial does not offer teaser rates and does not do any national advertising campaigns. New real estate customers primarily come from outbound calling to customers with an existing Wells Fargo relationships and where we can clearly demonstrate a tangible benefit for our customers by improving their financial situations.", "We conservatively underwrite these loans with full documentation and require income verification. The average FICO score on this portfolio was 642 and 65% of the portfolio had a FICO score above 620. The average loan-to-value was 76%; the average loan size was $124,000. Approximately, 45% of the portfolio was fixed rate loans. The remaining loans are 3/27 adjustable-rate mortgages with a fixed payment for the first three years of the loan. We underwrite these adjustable-rate loans to the fully indexed rate to ensure the customer's ability to afford their payments.", "In the second quarter, 60% of new originations were fixed rate loans. This prudent product strategy combined with cautious underwriting has resulted in stable and predictable credit performance. Our delinquency and foreclosure rates for this portfolio remained significantly better than published industry rates.", "Annualized net charge-offs at quarter end in this portfolio were below 20 basis points with second quarter losses of only $10 million. We have been proactive in mitigating the credit risk in this portfolio by obtaining private mortgage insurance on a significant portion of our higher loan-to-value loans.", "The recent regulatory guidelines issued for sub-prime lending will not have a significant impact on Wells Fargo Financial's operations since many of those guidelines have always been part of our normal business practices. This portfolio is 6% of our total loan portfolio and will not materially impact our credit losses or earnings.", "The $61 billion of first mortgages that were on our balance sheet at June 30th, 2007 consisted of $22 billion of debt consolidation loans at Wells Fargo Financial; $12 billion of home equity loans in the first mortgage position and $27 billion of largely prime, relationship-based first mortgages held at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, regional banking and our wealth management group.", "We do not offer or portfolio any negative amortizing or option ARMs. We obtain mortgage insurance on higher loan-to-value loans at Wells Fargo Financial and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and we continue to monitor regional economic and real estate trends and modify underwriting standards as needed.", "The credit performance of our real estate secured portfolio also benefits because Wells Fargo continues to be among the most experienced, most customer focused and highest rated loan servicers for both prime and non-prime loans. High-quality servicing improves customer service and has been demonstrated to result in lower foreclosures and losses.", "Charge-offs in our $61 billion one to four family first mortgage portfolio improved slightly from the first quarter to 13 basis points, only $19 million in second quarter net losses on the entire first mortgage portfolio.", "At quarter end 15% of our $81 billion National Home Equity Group portfolio was in the first lien position and approximately, 58% of the portfolio in a second lien position was behind a Wells Fargo first mortgage. The average FICO score was 748. The average combined LTV was 60% based on outstanding balances and 72% including unused commitments. 59% of the portfolio was fixed rate and 74% of new production during the quarter was fixed rate.", "Home equity losses have increased in response to current soft real estate market conditions in some markets while the frequency of losses was as expected, the severity has increased due to declining home values in some of the markets we serve.", "Over two years ago, we tightened underwriting standards in about 20 standard metropolitan areas that we felt had the greatest risk of home price declines. While that has mitigated our exposure, we are seeing some deterioration in other markets, primarily in the Midwest and California's Central Valley.", "Weakness in the home equity portfolio is particularly apparent in the 2006 vintage sourced through third party channels where current combined loan to values have risen above 90% in part due to the decline in local home values.", "This particular segment represents only 3% of the total home equity portfolio. In response we have tightened underwriting standards and increased focus on collections for our third party loans. We have benefited from our geographically diverse portfolio and we believe our underwriting practices are sound and collection resources adequate and well managed for the current environment.", "While charge-offs have increased from the historically low and unsustainable rates at year-end in this portfolio, non-performing loans and 90 days past due remained flat in the second quarter. Given current trends in many residential housing markets, we expect higher but manageable losses throughout 2007 in the home equity portfolio.", "Two other retail portfolios that are important to our credit performance are credit card and business direct. The $10 billion community banking credit card portfolio was primarily issued to our banking customers within our banking states. Our $11 billion business direct portfolio consists of small loans and lines of credit originated to small-business owners nationwide.", "These businesses continue to execute underwriting, account management and collection practices that have produced healthy loan growth and predictable results, typically better than industry norms, over an extended period of time.", "Our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios continue to benefit from exceptional credit results, healthy loan growth and wide geographic diversity. We finance a modest level of residential one to four family construction and land development, less than 2% of total loans, with minimal exposure to stressed property types, such as condo conversions and we have no exposure to large sub prime mortgage originators.", "Our risk profile in the wholesale businesses continue to benefit from low exposure to the airline and automobile industries. We have not significantly participated in the recently publicized large leveraged buyouts to private equity firms and in the sub prime CDO market our lending exposure related to collateralized debt obligations is minimal.", "The $57 million increase in commercial and commercial real estate non-accrual loans reflected $26 million of normal level of activity for the wholesale businesses and $31 million from a portfolio purchased by our equipment finance business. We consider the $634 million of total commercial and commercial real estate non-accrual loans at quarter end a reasonable and manageable level for a $132 billion loan portfolio.", "May, I shift to capital. On June 30th shareholders equity was $47 billion, up $5 billion from $42 billion a year ago. Our leveraged Tier I capital and total capital ratios were 7.9%, 8.57%, and 11.72% respectively. We expect the bond portfolio actions we took late in the second quarter will add to third quarter earnings and average assets, but will modestly reduce the leverage ratio. Our capital ratios remain very strong reflecting our ongoing focus on producing high risk adjusted returns in all of our activities, and in turn gives us capacity to continue to take advantage of attractive opportunities to produce strong returns for our shareholders.", "So, far this year we have opportunistically stepped up our share repurchase activity. In the second quarter we repurchased 30 million shares of Wells Fargo common stock. Year-to-date we have repurchased 77 million shares compared with 59 million shares repurchased in all of 2006. At June 30th approximately 60 million shares remained available for repurchase under Board authority. During the quarter we also issued $1 billion of attractively priced retail preferred securities, a low-cost way to add to permanent capital.", "Our M&A strategy remains focused on niche opportunities that add to value and we will not do any acquisitions unless they meet our long-standing financial criteria for accretion and returns. In the second quarter we acquired Placer Sierra Bancshares, a Northern California based bank holding company with $2.6 billion in assets and more than 650 team members serving consumer and small and medium size businesses from 50 locations throughout California.", "We acquired CIT Construction adding capability to provide commercial financing to the infrastructure construction industry. And we also announced the acquisition of Greater Bay Bancorp with $7.4 billion in assets, our third largest bank acquisition in our company's history. Greater Bay will enable us to better serve our community banking, commercial insurance brokerage and specialty finance and trust customers.", "Our preferred use of capital is to invest in our businesses, particularly to build and strengthen our distribution. In the second quarter of 2007, we opened 21 regional banking centers. We continue to add to our ATM network adding 41 new Web-enabled ATMs and converting 330 envelope-free ATMs during the quarter. We added almost 1000 platform banker FTEs from the second quarter of 2006.", "As I highlighted last quarter, the adoption of FIN 48 will cause more volatility in our effective tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. Our effective tax rate was 34% this quarter compared with 30% last quarter and 34% a year ago.", "In conclusion, we once again achieved double-digit earnings per share and double-digit revenue growth while achieving positive operating leverage. These outstanding results were driven by strong and well-balanced growth across our broadly diversified business segments.

(NYSE:WFC)  Q2 2007 Earnings Call July 17, 2007  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Bob Strickland - SVP & IR", " Howard Atkins - Sr. EVP & CFO", "Bob Strickland", "Hello, this is Bob Strickland. Thank you for calling into the Wells Fargo Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Review Prerecorded Call. Before we talk about our second quarter results, we need to make the standard securities law disclosure.", "In today's call, we will make forward-looking statements about specific income statement and balance sheet items and other measures of future results of operations and financial condition, such as statements about credit quality and future credit losses generally.", "Examples of forward-looking statements made in today's call include the expectation that earnings asset growth in second quarter 2007 will increase net interest income and reduce net interest margin; the expectation that losses in the home equity portfolio will be higher but manageable throughout 2007; the expectation that actions taken with respect to the bond portfolio late in second quarter 2007 will add to third quarter 2007 earnings but reduce the leverage ratio; and the belief that recent regulatory guidelines issued for subprime lending will not have a significant impact on Wells Fargo financials operation or on our credit losses or earnings.", "Forward-looking statements give our expectations about the future, they are not guarantees, and results may differ from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date.", "For a discussion of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to our SEC filings including the 8-K filed today, which includes the press release announcing our second quarter results, and to our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and to the information incorporated into those documents.", "Now, I will turn the review over to our Chief Financial Officer, Howard Atkins.", "Howard Atkins", "Thanks, Bob. Wells Fargo produced another very strong quarter, despite the challenges the industry has been facing this year. Once again, earnings per share grew 10% to a record $0.67 per share from $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2006. This is the 17th quarter out of the past 20 that we have grown earnings per share at a double-digit rate.", "Achieving double-digit growth in the current environment is difficult in any industry, not just banking, but the diversity of our revenue sources once again differentiated us from the rest of the industry. Results were driven by an ideal combination of double-digit revenue growth, positive operating leverage and relatively stable credit quality.", "Business performance was strong and well balanced across our broadly diverse business segments with most of our 80 plus consumer and commercial businesses producing double-digit earnings or revenue growth or both.", "Total revenue in the second quarter increased 13% from a year ago, the largest quarterly revenue increase in the last two years. Businesses that generated double-digit year-over-year revenue growth included asset management, business direct, capital markets, corporate trust, credit and debit cards, global remittance services, home equity, consumer finance, insurance, international, personal credit management, real estate brokerage and wealth management.", "Operating leverage, once again was positive with expenses increasing 11%, two percentage points below our 13% revenue growth. Virtually all of the year-over-year expense growth was directly or indirectly related to stronger sales and revenue. During the past year, we have opened 99 new regional banking stores and 20 new offices within and outside our traditional footprint to serve existing and new commercial relationships.", "In the process, we've added over 4,000 new team members, up 3% from a year ago, largely sales and service professionals. Sales commissions and related compensation increased in many of our fee-based businesses such as insurance, wealth management and real estate brokerage, all of which had particularly strong revenue growth year-over-year.", "Non-personnel expenses were relatively flat and declined in some categories, reflecting our ongoing discipline in containing expenses that don't directly add to revenue growth. Operating margins remain strong. We continue to have the highest net interest margin among our peers at 4.89%, up 13 basis points from a year ago.", "After having sold all of our lower yielding ARMs and securities over a year ago, when long-term interest rates were substantially lower than today, we began to invest again in longer-term securities late in the second quarter of 2007, as long-term interest rates rose substantially, adding approximately $30 billion in securities at attractive yields, substantially higher than the yields at which we sold our lowest yielding ARMs and long-term securities between mid 2004 and mid 2006.", "About half of the recently added securities were in the mortgage company, which periodically uses mortgage-backed securities to hedge the interest rate risk in the mortgage-servicing portfolio. The additional assets are expected to increase net interest income growth, but the higher average earning asset growth is likely to reduce net interest margin in the third quarter.", "At 1.82% our return on assets after all expenses and credit costs remained one of the highest among large banks and improved 11 basis points from the second quarter of 2006 despite the increase in charge-offs from a year ago. At 19.6% our return on equity remained one of the highest in the industry reflecting our double-digit earnings growth and our focus on achieving high risk-adjusted returns in all of our business activities.", "Reflecting the breadth and balance of our business model both our commercial and consumer businesses contributed to these consistently strong results.", "Let me give you some key details. First, our wholesale banking, our wholesale and commercial banking group, which serves primarily middle market customers and select niches in the large corporate market, had another record quarter. Net income grew 13% from a year ago, driven by 20% revenue growth.", "Growth in commercial loans and business deposits was strong as was growth in fee-based businesses such as insurance, capital markets, real estate brokerage and asset management. Wholesale banking group's average loans grew by 16% year-over-year and 18% annualized linked quarter.", "Asset-based lending, real estate, international and specialized financial-services, which include our capital markets activities and relationships with Fortune 500 companies, all experienced double-digit loan growth.", "Average commercial and commercial real estate loans, which included commercial loans in our wholesale segment, as well as, commercial loans in other segments such as small business increased 12% from the second quarter of 2006 and 15% annualized on a linked quarter basis.", "Commercial and commercial real estate loans have increased for 15 consecutive quarters and have grown at a double-digit rate for 11 consecutive quarters. Wholesale banking group's average core deposits were up $18 billion from the second quarter of 2006, which included certain funds that were previously swept into non-deposit products. Including only the growth in these funds post conversion to deposits, wholesale's average core deposits were up 32%.", "This growth was the result of higher balance growth from existing customers and new relationships, primarily in corporate banking and deposits from international customers doing business in the United States. Eastdil Secured, our real estate brokerage and investment banking company had a record quarter with revenue and income more than doubling from the first quarter of 2007.", "During the quarter, Eastdil advised on over $65 billion of real estate debt and equity transactions and continued to earn fees as the advisor to Blackstone Group in its $39 billion acquisition of Equity Office Properties Trust. The international group had double-digit revenue and earnings growth compared to the second quarter of 2006.", "Despite historically low volatility, the foreign exchange group arranged almost $13 billion in transactions per day in the second quarter, up 10%. We have one of the largest foreign exchange sales operations in the country with centers in San Francisco, New York, Minneapolis and 11 other markets offering pricing to our commercial, wealth management and retail customers in over 100 currencies.", "The wholesale services group continued to be a leader in technology by becoming the first major U.S. financial services company to offer mobile service for medium and large businesses, providing access to information about their accounts and transaction activities on mobile devices.", "By making it easier for our customers to do business with us, we continue to earn more of their business, through the first half of 2007; we have already received over 20% more checks through our Check21 solutions.", "Including our award winning Desktop Deposit service. Than we did the entire year of 2006, and active Commercial Electronic Office portal users were up 29% from 2006, and customers now initiate and receive more payments electronically than through checks. The Asset Management Group, which is responsible for managing and administering a total of $606 billion in client assets. Had record results with double-digit growth in revenue, earnings and assets under management.", "Assets under management were up 17% from second quarter of 2006, Wells Fargo Advantage Funds; our mutual fund business grew assets by 20% from a year ago. And ended the quarter with $134 billion in fund balances, this growth was driven by strong fund performance and new balances; over half of the Wells family of mutual funds we're in the top two Lipper Performance quintiles. Total Wells Fargo trust and investment management fees grew 24% from the second quarter of 2006. Let me now turn to community banking.", "Our Community Banking Group, comprised of regional banking, wealth management, mortgage banking and retail Internet had another strong quarter with 11% revenue growth and net income up 14%. Regional banking had a great quarter with record cross sell and improving customer experience scores.", "The average retail bank household had 5.4 products with Wells Fargo, a new record, up from five products a year ago and up from three products in 1998. 21% of our retail customers had over eight products with us our long-term goal.", "Up from 12% five years ago and in our top region 30% of our customers had over eight products with us. During the second quarter core product sales increased 9% from the prior year on a comparable basis to a total of $4.79 million sales.", "Platform banker FTEs increased 7% during the same time period; California continued to be one of our fastest growing states with a 14% increase in core product sales from the second quarter of 2006 on a comparable basis; sales of Wells Fargo Packages, which include a checking account and at least three other products such as a debit card, credit card, savings account or home equity loan were up 21% from the second quarter of 2006, and purchased by 66% of new checking account customers; our success in selling and increasing usage of our credit and debit cards among our customers increased card fees by almost $100 million, or 24% from the second quarter of 2006.", "At quarter end 36% of our retail bank customer, consumer households had a Wells Fargo credit card, up from 34% a year ago, and up from 24% five years ago; purchase volume on these cards was up 18% from a year ago, and average balances were up 21%. 91% of our consumer checking account customers had a debit card up from 85% five years ago. And purchase volume increased by 13% from a year ago. Average core deposits of $301 billion included certain funds that were previously swept into non-deposit products.", "Including only the growth in these funds from the date of their conversion to deposits or only deposits that were new to Wells Fargo. Average core deposits grew 11% from a year ago, and 14% annualized on a linked quarter basis; average mortgage escrow deposits were up $5.8 billion from the second quarter of 2006, and up $2.8 billion from the first quarter of 2007. Excluding mortgage escrow balances, total average core deposits grew 12% from the second quarter of 2006 and 11% annualized on a linked quarter basis.", "Average retail core deposits, which exclude wholesale banking and mortgage escrow deposits were up 6% from a year ago, and 8% annualized on a linked quarter basis; consumer checking accounts were up a net 4.9% from last year. And small business checking accounts were up a net 4.4% from last year.", "California continued to be our fastest growing market with checking accounts up a net 6%; this is the eighth consecutive quarter where net new accounts in California exceeded the average across our footprint. While we maintained one of the highest ratios of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits among large banks in the United States.", "Growth in interest-bearing checking and savings accounts and consumer CDs, continue to exceed the growth in non-interest bearing accounts. A trend that is consistent with the national monetary aggregates. Small business continues to be one of our best opportunities for growth sales of store-based business solutions were up 17% from last year on a comparable basis.", "And sales of Wells Fargo Business Services Packages, which include a business checking account, and at least three other business products such as a business debit card, business credit card, business savings account or business loan or line of credit were up 41%; these strong sales results increased our cross sell to our business banking households to 3.4 up from 3.1 a year ago. Bank loans to small businesses loans less than $100,000 on our business direct platform. Grew 18% from the second quarter of 2006.", "We continue to focus on delivering a great experience for our customers, and measuring our progress through 50,000 store-based customer surveys a month over 1.8 million surveys to date; for customers transacting at the teller line welcoming and wait time scores improved 22%, and customer loyalty scores have improved 11% from the second quarter of 2006. Our Wealth Management Group once again had a strong quarter with 17% revenue growth, and 23% earnings growth from a year ago.", "Revenue from brokerage increased 31%, and earnings were up 91% from a year ago driven by an increase in productivity from our financial consultants; this productivity lift helped brokerage assets under administration reach record levels, up 19% from the second quarter of 2006.", "WellsTrade, our online brokerage service introduced new pricing during the first quarter, which offers 100 commission free online trades per year for Wells Fargo PMA customers, since the new pricing in February new account openings have increased almost 100% over the same period last year. Wells Fargo continues to be a leader in online banking. At quarter end we had 9.3 million active online consumers up 17% from a year ago.", "63% of all Wells Fargo consumer checking account customers are now active online customers, we had 5.3 million bill pay customers up 32% from a year ago; we had 907,000 active online small-business customers, up 19% from a year ago.", "Internet sales continue to be an important channel for overall sales growth with consumer product sales up 36%. Consumer checking accounts up 30%, consumer savings accounts up 40%, and consumer credit products up 16% from the second quarter of 2006. Mortgage applications in the second quarter were running at relatively high levels up 6% from a year ago.", "Despite the increase in mortgage rates from last year, mortgage refi applications were up 24% from a year ago; at $68 billion purchase mortgage applications were close to the $71 billion in purchase applications taken during the home buying season last spring, mortgage applications in the second quarter were about the same as the high volume of applications taken in the first quarter of 2007. And the application pipeline at the end of the second quarter of $56 billion was also roughly the same as the unclosed pipeline at the end of the first quarter.", "Mortgage originations were up 18% from the first quarter, with most of the growth in the retail channel, the mortgage-servicing portfolio continued to grow as it has for 46 consecutive quarters. Despite ups and downs in interest rates and origination activity, our owned servicing portfolio was $1.4 trillion at quarter end, up 30% from a year ago, about 11% due to the servicing portfolio acquired from Washington Mutual last year.", "Gross servicing fees of $1 billion were up 23% from a year ago, but were down 4% on a linked quarter basis primarily because of the sale of $1.4 billion in excess servicing rights.", "Excess servicing essentially represents an interest only strip above the normal amount of the traditional servicing fee. The sale was undertaken at about breakeven to further reduce the interest rate risk in the servicing portfolio.", "Mortgage banking non-interest income was $689 million, down $101 million from first quarter. The impact of higher interest rates on the value of MSRs, net of hedging costs was a $225 million net loss.", "The net gain on mortgage loan origination and sale activities was positively impacted by higher gain on sale margins during the quarter, and also included a $135 million increase in the fair value of servicing associated with mortgage loans held for sale at quarter end.", "The anticipatory actions we took in February to further strengthen our residential real estate underwriting standards and some pricing improvements on these loans in the second quarter resulted in only a $35 million of revenue reduction on non-prime loans reflected in net gains on mortgage loan origination sales activities compared to $90 million in revenue reduction taken in the first quarter.", "Total non-prime residential real estate secured originations were down $2.7 billion from the second quarter of 2006. Revenue at our consumer finance company Wells Fargo financial, increased 10% from a year ago driven by a 14% increase in loans.", "Growth in revenue and loans was somewhat more moderate than in prior periods as we began shifting several quarters ago toward the lower risk end of the spectrum on credit products we offer in our auto segment.", "Let me now shift to credit quality. Overall, credit quality was in line with our expectations. Total credit losses were stable in the quarter at $720 million compared with $715 million in the first quarter, and $726 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.", "Loss rates declined slightly from 0.90% of average loans in the first quarter to 0.87% in the second quarter. Total non-performing assets were also relatively flat at $2.71 billion or 0.79% of loans in the second quarter, compared with $2.67 billion or 0.82% of loans in the first quarter.", "Our non-performing loan portfolio continued to have relatively low loss potential based on the high percentage of consumer real estate and auto secured loans where we take an initial write down to estimated net realizable value as the loan is transferred to non-performing status.", "Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, excluding insured and guaranteed Ginny Mae balances, declined by $43 million or 4% from first quarter and were down 6% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2006.", "As I've done in prior quarters I will provide additional credit metrics on our major loan portfolios. But, first I want to highlight some areas, where we have minimal exposure, and have proactively taken steps to reduce our risk and enhance our credit performance.", "We do not retain any credit residuals on any of the prime or non-prime mortgage loans we sell or securitize. A small portion of mortgage loans sold is subject to early payment default risk. In the second quarter we added $35 million to our repurchase reserve for estimated early payment default on all previously sold mortgages.", "While we do not retain the credit risk on the majority of our $1.4 trillion residential mortgage servicing portfolio serving 10 million loans, we closely monitor the credit performance of the entire portfolio. Almost 90% of the mortgage loans we service are for prime customers.", "We value and price our prime and subprime servicing based on expected repayment performance so that we are properly compensated for the added work related to potentially higher delinquency in the subprime portfolios.", "We also price servicing based on the origination channel with better credit performance in our retail originations versus correspondent wholesale channels. While delinquencies and foreclosures are increasing, only 0.56% of our servicing portfolio, in other words less than 1% is in foreclosure, which is below the industry average.", "We work closely with our servicing customers to try and keep them in their homes and work with national industry groups to promote and encourage customers to contact their lenders with possible problems.", "We have very little ARM reset risk across our loan and servicing portfolios. The bulk of the first mortgages we originate are sold to investors; the bulk of any mortgages we retain are either relationship ARMs, where the customer typically has substantial deposit balances and or multiple products with us, or in our consumer finance business debt consolidation mortgages where the borrower's debt service is not increased by the mortgage loan.", "In both cases our ARM reset risk and credit exposure generally is minimal and much less than the industry overall. Less than 15% of our total ARM loans held on our balance sheet are scheduled to reset in the next 18 months.", "We have never offered or retained negative am or option ARMs with lower initial teaser rates, which is where the greatest risk exists for other providers in the industry.", "In our home equity and home mortgage businesses, we have further tightened correspondent and broker underwriting requirements, primarily reducing stated income and reduced documentation programs. We also discontinued purchasing subprime loans from correspondents at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage during the quarter.", "We have negligible direct exposure to hedge funds. Lending directly to private equity sponsors is immaterial and not a strategic focus of our business. Borrowers owned by private equity firms are primarily financed through our asset-based or specialized lending units. These loans constitute less than 2% of our total loans.", "We have consciously avoided participating in high profile or controversial financings of this type. Most of our nonprime loans are originated and held at Wells Fargo Financial. Financial has two principal consumer credit portfolios, auto and real estate.", "We continue to see an improvement in the credit performance of our $28 billion auto portfolio with net charge-offs down $42 million from the first quarter and down $88 million from the third quarter 2006 peak. 90 days past due continued to improve and were down 25% from the first quarter and are down 37% from the fourth-quarter peak.", "While the actions we have taken to improve collections capacity and efficiency drove this improved performance, the auto industry typically experiences seasonal declines in credit performance in the second half of the year and we will carefully monitor our delinquency and loss performance and continue to adjust our auto loan origination and collection process as necessary.", "Over 70% of the auto portfolio had a FICO score above 620. The size of our auto portfolio was essentially unchanged from last quarter reflecting tightening of account acquisition strategies to reduce loan volume in the higher risk tiers. Nearly 80% of new originations in the second quarter had FICO scores above 620.", "At quarter end, Wells Fargo Financial had $22 billion in U.S.-based real estate secured debt consolidation loans. This portfolio has performed better than the rest of the industry's nonprime mortgage portfolios, because of the nature of the product, the type of customers who buy this product as well as the long-standing discipline with which these loans have always been underwritten and managed at Wells Fargo.", "These loans are for debt consolidation purposes, not for the purchase of a home. This means our customers are not incurring significant new financial obligations and in fact their monthly payments are typically lower than they were prior to taking out the debt consolidation loan. 96% of this portfolio is in a first lien position.", "Wells Fargo Financial, does not do any interest only, stated income, option ARMs, or negative amortizing loans. All loans are originated by Wells Fargo financial team members we do not use any brokers or correspondents in this business.", "Wells Fargo Financial does not offer teaser rates and does not do any national advertising campaigns. New real estate customers primarily come from outbound calling to customers, with an existing Wells Fargo relationship. And, where we can clearly demonstrate a tangible benefit for our customers by improving their financial situations.", "We conservatively underwrite these loans with full documentation and require income verification. The average FICO score on this portfolio was 642. And 65% of the portfolio had a FICO score above 620. The average loan to value was 76% the average loan size was $124,000.", "Approximately 45% of the portfolio was fixed rate loans. The remaining loans are 327 adjustable-rate mortgages with a fixed payment for the first three years of the loan. We underwrite these adjustable-rate loans to the fully indexed rate to ensure the customer's ability to afford their payments.", "In the second quarter, 60% of new originations were fixed rate loans. This prudent product strategy combined with cautious underwriting has resulted in stable and predictable credit performance.", "Our delinquency and foreclosure rates for this portfolio remained significantly better than published industry rates. Annualized net charge-offs at quarter end in this portfolio were below 20-basis points, with second-quarter losses of only $10 million.", "We have been proactive in mitigating the credit risk in this portfolio by obtaining private mortgage insurance on a significant portion of our higher loan to value loans. The recent regulatory guidelines issued for subprime lending will not have a significant impact on Wells Fargo Financial's operations.", "Since many of those guidelines have always been part of our normal business practices. This portfolio is 6% of our total loan portfolio, and will not materially impact our credit losses or earnings.", "The $61 billion of first mortgages that were on our balance sheet at June 30, 2007 consisted of $22 billion of debt consolidation loans at Wells Fargo Financial, $12 billion of home equity loans in the first mortgage position, and $27 billion of largely prime, relationship-based first mortgages held at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage regional banking and our wealth management group.", "We do not offer or portfolio any negative amortizing or option ARMs. We obtain mortgage insurance on higher loan to value loans at Wells Fargo Financial and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and we continue to monitor regional economic and real estate trends and modify underwriting standards as needed.", "The credit performance of our real estate secured portfolio also benefits, because Wells Fargo continues to be among the most experienced, most customer focused and highest rated loan servicers for both prime and nonprime loans.", "High-quality servicing improves customer service and has been demonstrated to result in lower foreclosures and losses. Charge-offs in our $61 billion one-to-four family first mortgage portfolio improved slightly from the first quarter to 13 basis points, only $19 million in second-quarter net losses on the entire first mortgage portfolio.", "At quarter end 15% of our $81 billion National Home Equity Group portfolio was in the first lien position and approximately 58% of the portfolio in a second lien position was behind a Wells Fargo first mortgage.", "The average FICO score was 748. The average combined LTV was 60% based on outstanding balances and 72% including unused commitments. 59% of the portfolio was fixed rate and 74% of new production during the quarter was fixed rate.", "Home equity losses have increased in response to current soft real estate market conditions in some markets. While the frequency of losses was as expected, the severity has increased due to declining home values in some of the markets we serve.", "Over two years ago we tightened underwriting standards in about 20 standard metropolitan areas that we felt had the greatest risk of home price declines. While that has mitigated our exposure, we are seeing some deterioration in other markets primarily in the Midwest and California's Central Valley.", "Weakness in the home equity portfolio is particularly apparent in the 2006 vintage sourced through third party channels, where current combined loan to values have risen above 90% in part due to the decline in local home values.", "This particular segment represents only 3% of the total home equity portfolio. In response we have tightened underwriting standards and increased focus on collections for our third party loans. We have benefited from our geographically diverse portfolio and we believe our underwriting practices are sound and collection resources adequate and well managed for the current environment.", "While charge-offs have increased from the historically low and unsustainable rates at year-end in this portfolio, non-performing loans and 90 days past due remained flat in the second quarter.", "Given current trends in many residential housing markets, we expect higher but manageable losses throughout 2007 in the home equity portfolio. Two other retail portfolios that are important to our credit performance are credit card and business direct.", "The $10 billion community banking credit card portfolio was primarily issued to our banking customers within our banking states. Our $11 billion business direct portfolio consists of small loans and lines of credit originated to small-business owners nationwide.", "These businesses continue to execute underwriting, account management and collection practices that have produced healthy loan growth and predictable results, typically better than industry norms, over an extended period of time.", "Our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios continue to benefit from exceptional credit results, healthy loan growth and wide geographic diversity. We finance a modest level of residential one to four family construction and land development, less than 2% of total loans, with minimal exposure to stressed property types, such as condo conversions, and we have no exposure to large sub prime mortgage originators.", "Our risk profile in the wholesale businesses, continue to benefit from low exposure to the airline and automobile industries. We have not significantly participated in the recently publicized large leveraged buyouts to private equity firms.", "And in the sub prime CDO market our lending exposure related to collateralized debt obligations is minimal.", "The $57 million increase in commercial and commercial real estate non-accrual loans reflected $26 million of normal level of activity for the wholesale businesses and $31 million from a portfolio purchased by our equipment finance business.", "We consider the $634 million of total commercial and commercial real estate non-accrual loans at quarter end a reasonable and manageable level for a $132 billion loan portfolio.", "Let me now shift to capital. On June 30th shareholders equity was $47 billion, up $5 billion from $42 billion a year ago. Our leveraged Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 7.9%, 8.57%, and 11.72% respectively.", "We expect the bond portfolio actions we took late in the second quarter will add to third-quarter earnings and average assets, but will modestly reduce the leverage ratio. Our capital ratios remain very strong reflecting our ongoing focus on producing high risk-adjusted returns in all of our activities. And in turn gives us capacity to continue to take advantage of attractive opportunities to produce strong returns for our shareholders.", "So far this year we have opportunistically stepped up our share repurchase activity. In the second quarter we repurchased 30 million shares of Wells Fargo common stock. Year-to-date we have repurchased 77 million shares compared with 59 million shares repurchased in all of 2006.", "At June 30th approximately 60 million shares remained available for repurchase under Board authority. During the quarter we also issued $1 billion of attractively priced retail preferred securities, a low-cost way to add to permanent capital.", "Our M&A strategy remains focused on niche opportunities that add to value and we will not do any acquisitions unless they meet our long-standing financial criteria for accretion and returns.", "In the second quarter we acquired Placer Sierra Bancshares, a Northern California based bank holding company with $2.6 billion in assets and more than 650 team members serving consumer and small and medium-size businesses from 50 locations throughout California.", "We acquired CIT Construction adding capability to provide commercial financing to the infrastructure construction industry. And we also announced the acquisition of Greater Bay Bancorp with $7.4 billion in assets, our third-largest bank acquisition in our company's history. Greater Bay will enable us to better serve our community banking, commercial insurance brokerage and specialty finance and trust customers.", "Our preferred use of capital is to invest in our businesses, particularly to build and strengthen our distribution. In the second quarter of 2007, we opened 21 regional banking centers.", "We continue to add to our ATM network adding 41 new Web enabled ATMs and converting 330 envelope-free ATMs during the quarter. We added almost 1000 platform banker FTEs from the second quarter of 2006.", "As I highlighted last quarter, the adoption of FIN 48 will cause more volatility in our effective tax rate from quarter to quarter. Our effective tax rate was 34% this quarter compared with 30% last quarter and 34% a year ago.", "In conclusion, we once again achieved double-digit earnings per share and double-digit revenue growth, while achieving positive operating leverage. These outstanding results were driven by strong and well-balanced growth across our broadly diversified business segments. Our long-standing discipline managing risk was reflected in our relatively stable credit quality.", "Thank you for listening.

Bush - NAB Research LLC ", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Luwen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wachovia Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. ", "I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Alice Lehman, Head of Wachovia Investor Relations. Ma'am you may begin your conference. ", "Alice Lehman - Head of Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator. And thanks for everyone for joining the call this morning. We hope you've received our earnings release by now as well as the supplemental quarterly earnings report. If you haven't, both are available on our Investor Relations website at wachovia.com/investor. ", "In this call, we'll review the first 14 pages of the quarterly earnings report. In addition to this teleconference, this call is available through a listen-only live audio webcast. Replays of the teleconference will be available by about 2:30 today and will continue through 5:00 p.m. Friday, August 31st. The replay phone number is 706-645-9291, and the access code is 3661619. ", "Our CEO Ken Thompson will kick things off. He'll be followed by our CFO, Tom Wurtz, and our Chief Credit Officer, Don Truslow. Also with us are other members of our executive management team. We'll be happy to take your questions at the end. Of course, before we begin, I have a few reminders. ", "First, any forward-looking statements made during this call are subjects to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause Wachovia's results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements are set forward in Wachovia's public report filed with the SEC including Wachovia's current report on Form 8-K filed today. ", "Second, some of the discussion about our company's performance today will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information that reconciles those measures to GAAP measures can be found in our filings with the SEC and in the news release and the supplemental material located at wachovia.com/investor. ", "Third, Wachovia's proposed merger with A. G. Edwards will be addressed in a definitive proxy statement prospectus to be filed with the SEC. We urge you to read that document because it will contain important information. ", "Information regarding the participants in the proxy solicitation is contained in our annual proxy materials filed with the SEC and will also be contained in the definitive proxy statement prospectus. That document and other SEC filings can be obtained for free at the SEC's website and from Wachovia and A.G. Edwards. ", "Finally, when you ask questions please give your name and your firm's name. Now let me turn things over to Ken. ", "G. Kennedy Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Alice and good morning to everyone. We really thank you for joining us at the end of what's been for you I know a very busy week. I am going to start off by making some brief opening comments, and then I am going to turn the mic over to Tom Wurtz and Don Truslow for more specific follow-up. ", "We're pleased... we are very pleased with our second quarter results. Earnings per share of $1.23 in what we consider to be quarter with very little no exits [ph]. We are experiencing customer growth in all of our four business lines. And customer service scores are the best that they've ever been and they are continuing to improve. And the result of these two facts is that we are adding new customers at a significantly higher rate than we are at attriting customers. ", "We experienced really good balance sheet growth in the quarter. Both loans and core deposits are up nicely, and fee income was outstanding across almost every category in each of our four business lines. ", "On the expense side, our efficiency ratio has improved over the last twelve months by 270 basis points, and that's in spite of significant investment of expense dollars and capital in new business initiatives which will pay off for us in the future. And in risk management, I am particularly happy with their position in a very difficult environment. ", "Net charge-offs continue to be very low 14 basis points. NPAs increased for us slightly in this quarter; that was primarily in mortgage. But if you compare our mortgage company to almost any other in the industry, our NPAs are outstanding, and our NPAs at a company level would have to be considered outstanding in comparison to our peer group. ", "Lastly, we are very comfortable with where we sit today in a conservative position in virtually all asset classes as markets re-price risks and Don Truslow will talk more about that with you later. ", "So with those opening comments, let me now turn it over Thom Wurtz to walk you through our guidance. ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Ken and I would add my thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I believe we are delivering a solid quarter very much in line with our April guidance. There is strong revenue growth, appropriate expense management and stable credit quality, and personally, it's gratifying to produce solid bottom-line results. We're continuing to invest in our core businesses and maintaining appropriate risk profile in spite of some fairly croppy credit market. While volatility in money markets has been higher than recent quarters, it's overall suitable backdrop for us to continue to meet our goals for the year. ", "As we go through the quarterly earnings report that I hope all of you have available to you. Just a reminder, since Golden West was not part of Wachovia until the fourth quarter of 2006 we have introduced the concept of a combined 2006 results which attempts to portray how our results would have looked if in fact we had been consolidated for each quarter of 2006. ", "So, with that if we can turn to page 2. As Ken noted GAAP earnings totaled $2.3 billion which translates to $1.22 a share or $1.23 on an operating basis. On a linked basis, the corporate investment bank produced bottom-line results which were up 58% on broad strength across all major business lines. Wealth Management grew 11%. The General Bank grew 1% despite some headwinds. Capital Management was essentially flat compared to record first quarter results, and it continues to execute extraordinary well, up 30% from the second quarter of last year. ", "Overall, revenue was a record $8.7 billion. While net interest income was down about 1%, fee income was up 13%, producing overall revenue growth of 6%. It was particularly noteworthy of the strength across all major fee categories in addition to viewing it from a business segment standpoint as well. Expenses were up 6%, primarily a result of higher revenue-based incentives and investment spending, which I'll get to you later. ", "Commercial loans grew at 5% while organic growth and consumer loans came in at 2%. While reported consumer loan balances declined modestly as a result of sale and securitization activity, consumer loan originations were up 8% to $28 billion in the quarter. ", "Average core deposits grew at an annualized rate of about 10% with notable strength in foreign deposits and checking balances. ", "And finally, non-performing assets picked up to 47 basis points while charge-offs decreased slightly to 14 basis points. The provision of $179 million reflects the addition of reserves for solid growth that we witnessed in our loan portfolio and stable trends within those portfolios and capital ratios remain on target. ", "Page 3 simply reconciles GAAP with operating results and it really requires no further explanations, so we'll turn to page 4. Page 4 shows income statement on a consolidated basis. It's worth noting here that net interest income declined less than a percent from Q1 as we continued to experience some margin compression which exceeded the near-term impact of balance sheet growth. We believe that a variety of modest, favorable factors will likely produce modestly higher net interest income in the second half of the year compared to the first half, resulting in flattish year-over-year net interest income growth. ", "Turing to page 5, you can see the overhead efficiency ratio generally consistent with Q1 and down 270 basis points from the second quarter of 2006. If you look down to the next line on the page, you see that the improvement is closure to 300 basis points including brokerage. Obviously the strong growth we have experienced in brokerage which is a narrow margin business has matched some of the fundamental improvements in the rest of the company. ", "The net interest margin dipped by 9 basis points, which is a combination of core compression and a few basis points of timing that will likely reverse itself over the next couple of quarters. This compression is largely associated with continued expansion of our structured products business we're carrying abroad. We have seen some continued mix shift in the loan portfolio and within deposit products based on customer preferences. But we believe we are taking appropriate actions to focus our sales force and growing core deposits and taking care of customers. Charge-offs of 14 basis points are well in check, and we don't see any new pressures there on the credit front. ", "Capital ratios are right in line where we want them, and you can see the fully diluted share count down by about 6 million shares with period-end shares down about 10 million. We purchased about 13 million shares during the quarter. The employee count is flat despite some robust growth in the General Bank, you'll hear about later. ", "Page 6 details the major balance sheet trends which I spoke too earlier. I would like to point out a few items of note. First is the 18% growth in average trading assets, which is one of the factors that pressured the net interest margin in the quarter. Second is that loan originations were very strong for the quarter as loans held for sale grew almost $1 billion, in spite of the securitization sale of $21 billion of loans in the quarter. ", "And finally, it's also worth noting that low cost core deposits grew approximately 7% compared to a combined second quarter of 2006 reflecting nice growth in money market products and interest checking. ", "Looking to page 7, very nice growth in fee income from both traditional banking fees and market-related businesses in aggregate up 13% linked quarter, a nice uptick in service charges, up 9%. Other banking fees were up quite nicely compared to Q1 and adjusted for MSR gain, which is offset entirely in other income line, they are up a very solid 7%. ", "Commissions remain very solid, down about a percent from Q1 despite lower contribution from record equity syndicate activity in Q1. Fiduciary and asset management fees up 7% linked quarter, 21% year-over-year is simply a great story. ", "I'll cover the fee income line exclusive to the corporate investment bank when I speak to the results for CIB and then also we're going to...business unit leaders to speak about the results for a moment as well. ", "Finally, other income down 5% including the hedging losses I just referenced and associated with mortgage servicing rights which drove lower securitization gains. ", "On page 8, we detail expenses, up 6% on a linked quarter basis right in line with the guidance that we provided in April. Overall expenses up $268 million, but what we need to keep in mind is that first quarter expenses included $93 million of additional stock compensation expense. So, really we are dealing with an increase of about $350 million quarter-over-quarter. Of that amount, about 60% is from higher revenue-based incentives based on the high revenue growth for the quarter and merit increases which we end up awarding at the end of first quarter and so you see the fourth quarter impact of that. So 60% of $350 million comes from those factors. ", "About 25% of the increase is attributable to activities directly in support of revenue growth like advertising, travel and the cost of new branches that we opened up about 20. We consolidated about 58 branches. We expanded in a variety of our business lines, added brokers and so forth. And so there is about $50 million or 50% of... 15% of the total that are attributable to things like consulting, outside legal fees, loan origination costs and processing costs that I think are the things that people would have a real focus on us, keeping an eye on it and we have. ", "Overall, the expense increase for the quarter is likely on a surface higher than people would have guessed. But we've indicated we are focused on our management expense growth including continued investments at a level that index to our revenue opportunity and that's exactly what we've done. ", "Turning to the business units, I will start on page 9 with the General Bank. The bottom-line growth masked the core strength in the business. Revenue growth was solid, up 8% on an annualized basis in spite of flat net interest income. Major initiatives included executing in the quarter on branch building, Western expansion, branch consolidation, credit card growth, expansion in mortgage platform, in Wachovia branches efficiency initiatives. Expense increases were very moderate. ", "Highlights for the quarter which I am sure Don will speak to, include solid deposit growth, strong fee income growth, solid loan growth and continued success with customer satisfaction and loyalty initiatives. You have seen increase in provision in the General Bank and that's entirely attributable to growth in the credit card portfolio and our indirect auto portfolio where we're seeing very nice growth in those businesses. ", "Wealth Management shown on page 10 produced bottom-line growth of 11% linked quarter and 22% versus a year ago as much more in line with our experience over the last several years, which was recently interrupted by restructuring the organizational structure of Wealth Management and changing our advisory model over the past few quarters. So we continue to see great acceptance for the new investment platform, and we look for solid results going forward. ", "Turning to the corporate investment bank on page 11, we had a great quarter with record revenue in earnings, saw strength across all major lines and robust growth in both net interest income and fee income. Clearly a great quarter for principal investing for us and for the industry. I think there is a lot of focus on principal investing and trading and what contribution was to our overall results. ", "To put in perspective, if you take a look at the first six months last year versus first six months this year, trading and principal investing is up about $50 million over the first six months of this year versus last year. So, relatively comparable and obviously markets are a little stronger now than they were last year, so no surprises. ", "Within our other capital market businesses, execution in the context of CD volatile market was solid. Within structured products we saw a pretty strong rebound in structured set of products from the first quarter which included results that were impacted by market disruption. This quarter our CMBS businesses posted better results in spite of the fact that they were faced with margin pressures and deals that were coming to market. The spreads are widening and coordination levels are increasing. We think we've managed through this volatility very well. ", "Wealth markets are clearly more volatile than in recent past. We ended the third quarter with strong pipelines and good momentum but probably greater uncertainty about pipeline, and I think that's probably true for all participants. ", "Capital Management shown on page 12, again flat results with record first quarter results year-over-year rose 30%, great focus on execution of expense management, disciplined acquisitions and thoughtful integration of new businesses, is just the wonderful story there. ", "Our brokerage highlights include: Series 7 advisors up 8% annualized from the first quarter, and also this was at trading [ph] commission 10% to 15% higher than similar hires a year ago, so very good story there; continued migration of customers, managed account program and solid increases in client assets. ", "One note on asset management, previously both CMG and our wealth unit had investment discretion with respect to co-managed, non-proprietary assets held by certain wealth customers. We have footnoted this in the past. We've now move to model where authority resides only with the Wealth Management team for those accounts. That's why we've moved the balances out of CMG for reporting purposes and that will be the pattern we'll follow going forward. ", "Now, I'll ask Don if he would speak to credit and then I'll follow up very quickly with earnings guidance. ", "Donald K. Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Great. Thank you, Tom. Our credit quality for the quarter remained very healthy. It's already... has been a noted no real meaningful surprises and all of that against the backdrop of some pretty challenging credit markets particularly here in the last few weeks. ", "Starting with non-performance assets, we did see a $341 million increase in non-performs linked quarter, driven mainly by more delinquencies in the residential real estate portfolio. Now, of the total increase of $341 million, $224 million represented commercial real estate loans and about $15 million of the increase was in consumer foreclosed properties. And I will just note that as we discussed in some depth last quarter, our overall consumer portfolio is very well secured and has demonstrated very low loss content through time, and that continues to be the case. ", "The average loan to value of the residential non-performing loan book using updated appraisal information where we have gone out and we have refreshed appraisal information on the book is at a very low 72% as of the quarter end giving us very good cushion against those loans. ", "We are experiencing some of the same trends, obviously seen in the overall mortgage market, which are driving up delinquencies. And in addition to that, we are also seeing some seasoning of the portfolio given the growth in the business over the last couple of years. So, to be expected, our default loan servicing centers are noting. They talk to defaulting clients that the predominant two reasons for those clients having trouble making their mortgage payments really relate back to some sort of loss of income or excessive data obligation outside the mortgage itself. So this would be where clients have secured mortgage from us and then subsequent to that maybe put a second from another financial institution behind us or leverage off their balance sheet in some way and have run into overall problems in servicing their overall debt. ", "I do want to remind everybody that our pick-a-pay product, which is our option payment ARM, is structured with caps that limit the amount, customers payment may increase in any given year to no more than 7.5% of the payment. So, on a $1000 mortgage payment that would be a $75 increase from one year to the next and therefore just want to point out the payment shock in our option ARM is just not an issue here at all. It's really not an issue with the product. ", "Given the environment, again we're not surprised to see the residential market performance trend-up as we noted last quarter is what we have been expecting. And I would anticipate that we'll continue to see some trend-up over the next few quarters as well. But because the way these loans are underwritten, we are not seeing any meaningful increases and losses in the portfolio, and we don't expect to see any rises and losses as we look forward over the next few quarters. And so the underwriting process and how these things are booked and what we are ultimately relying upon are holding up very, very well as expected. ", "We also saw a modest $60 million increase in commercial non-performing loans. That $60 million was scattered across several names and looking at those names and through the watchless [ph] processes we don't believe that there are any additional significant losses on those names beyond what we've probably or what we have already taken. ", "Charge-offs, as Tom noted, for the quarter were down slightly from the first quarter. Gross charge-offs were essentially flat. The coverage were up just a lit bit, and our ratio came in at about 14 basis points. The largest commercial charge-off we saw during quarter was just under $5 million and then they dropped off pretty significantly from there. ", "On the allowance front, the provision, once again exceeded net charge-offs by a modest amount which primarily represented the additional allowance needed to support loan growth and again Tom noted in the card and the dealer financial services book where we've seen a pretty nice growth. ", "Credit quality indicators across the portfolio continue to look very healthy with only a very modest rise in credit size assets and the category of credit size assets where we're seeing summarized would be the least risky the other assets especially mentioned. And given that we don't have a sub-prime focus in our business and that our home equity loan exposure is both modest and mostly all in the form of very high quality prime equity lines combined with a low loss content of our non-performing allowance, we are very comfortable with our allowance coverages at the end of the quarter. ", "I thought I would just make a couple of comments switching gears about the turbulence in the capital markets and the impact on Wachovia. Overall, I feel like we are in very good shape. It strikes us that the route of what's been going on is a re-pricing of risks to a more rational and appropriate levels, acknowledged that the turbulence is causing some disruption in the market. And but in the end it's probably a very healthy correction to a market that has become very aggressive and its willingness to accept ever increasing leverage levels, weaker structures and thinner pricing. ", "Probably not appropriate to get too specific around the numbers at Wachovia, but acknowledging there would be high level of interest in that but for competitive reasons, I want to be a little careful of how specific we get. But we view the risk to Wachovia, what's currently happening is very modest but let me give you just a little bit of color. ", "In our CMBS fixed rate warehouses, they are running at levels of 50% to 70% where they normally run. We feel good about the current collateral that is in the warehouses now, generally in line with market pricing levels. And we feel very good that our rate and spread hedging strategies really have been effective. And I will say that we see no credit deterioration here at all. ", "The other structured product warehouses are also at modest levels. We scrutinized our positions across all of our warehouses in structured product businesses at quarter end and took some modest write-down, and we had since liquidated a number of those positions. We have very little hedge fund exposure and as you know we are not in the prime brokerage business. So we're not having real concerns there. ", "Our high yield bridge exposure for mandated deal and our mandated leveraged loan pipeline is very modest compared to the announced deals in the overall market and the positions held by many other underwriters. And we are not overly concerned about any of our transactions. We are currently holding no funded high yield bridge loans right now. We have very little in the way of equity bridge exposure and no concerns about the small positions that we do hold. We are very selective where we enter into equity bridges, where we feel very good about the distribution capabilities, the quality of the deal and quality of the financial sponsor. And so we are very selective in that end of the market. ", "And lastly, I think it would be important to note that we underwrite all of our deals across all of our platforms which are slated for distribution with an eye toward our willingness to hold the entire position if necessary. And therefore again, we've been very selective about the transactions we are willing to back. ", "As per sub-prime in our capital markets businesses and in our origination businesses, we shied away from diving into this business over the last few years as that market took off. Really for two reasons: one is given the firm's prior experience in the sub-prime market in the late 90's and also importantly the view of our capital markets of the risk in this arena has been under priced for quite sometime. So, we just haven't felt that it's been a business that made a good sense for us and therefore we've actively managed our business to minimize our exposure to the sub-prime market. So, as a result, there has been little impact to our businesses with the turbulence in the sub-prime markets, and we don't anticipate any meaningful potential impact to earnings from sub-prime going forward. ", "So, to wrap up as we said coming into the year we anticipated seeing a modest rise in credit costs from the extraordinarily low level we experienced in 2006, and it looks like 2007 is basically unfolding exactly what we expected [ph]. We feel very good about where we wind up the quarter and the outlook for the remainder of the year. ", "Tom, I'll turn it back to you. ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Don. I would now ask people to turn to page 14, which is the updated full year outlook. And it's pretty straight forward, just two points to make. First, our guidance doesn't reflect the merger with A.G. Edwards, so it's just for legacy Wachovia. And the only point we would make about update to the guidance would be, while net interest income growth looks more flattish than it did back in April, our net credit income or NII minus provision expense looks about the same to us. We really don't have much of the change in view as to what net credit income looks like. And so, overall no real bottom line impact, just to tweak the geography. ", "Before I turn it back over to Ken, I would like to just make one note that we have decided to discontinue the legacy Golden West monthly financial highlight report. Obviously as we move further along in the integration of our two platforms, this report no longer provides a real look at the business. What does provide relevant insight is our combined mortgage origination results as well as retail deposit growth results with are contained in the appendix. And so, one thing I am pleased today is that over the first five months of the year we saw contraction in this portfolio size at legacy Golden West and in June we actually had a little bit of growth. And early on in July looks like a little bit of growth as well. So, hopefully we have eclipsed that trend. So, we are starting to see a reduction in prepays that is outstripping pressures on origination volumes. ", "So, with that, I will turn it back over to Ken. ", "G. Kennedy Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you, Tom. And before we go into Q&A, I referenced at the beginning of my comments the strength that we are seeing in each of our four lines of business. And we thought it might be useful for you to have each of the business hedged, give you a very brief view of their outlook for the businesses. So, I am going to ask each of them to do that. We will start with Ben Jenkins of our General Bank. ", "Benjamin P. Jenkins III - Vice Chairman and President of the General Bank", "Ken, thank you. And for our businesses, we expect the second half of the year will continue to be challenging from an economic environment standpoint. But with that said, we believe we have got good momentum going into the second half of the year based on our performance in the second quarter. ", "The second quarter was exceptional for us from a retail sales standpoint. We acquired in the second quarter 426,000 new retail households or customers with more than 90% of that number acquired through a deposit relationship. Take that number and just annualize it, it's about a 14%... greater than 14% acquisition rate which is the highest we have seen in our retail volume, since about the fourth quarter of 2003, first quarter of 2004, when we introduced pre-checking. ", "If you look at deposit account sales, they were up 18% by dollars on a linked quarter basis, and if you look at net new checking it was up 16% on a linked quarter basis. And if you further look at the first two quarters, our net new checking totaled 579,000 in net new units and that would compare against 550,000 for all of last year's. So, we feel great about that. ", "Our customer service scores were the highest in our history with customer satisfaction at 6.65 out of a 7 point scale, and our customer loyalty percentage was at 54%. And because of all that, not surprisingly customer attrition remained in that 10% to 11% annualized number. ", "Balance sheet growth was strong throughout the second quarter with 6% year-over-year loan growth and 8% year-over-year deposit growth. Fee income, we were pleased, was equally strong, up 13% on a year-over-year basis and 11% on a linked quarter basis. The growth we are seeing encourages us, and when it's coupled I think with strong margin management and an expected leveling out of expenses in the third and fourth quarter all that will allow us I think to perform very, very well against our competitors in the second half of the year. ", "G. Kennedy Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Ben. We will turn to Steve Cummings from Corporate and Investment Banking. ", "Stephen E. Cummings - Head, Corporate and Investment Banking", "Okay, thanks Ken. Obviously it's hard not to feel good about our record quarter, earnings up 57% from prior quarter and 19% from prior year. I would say that we feel particularly good in the environment that we have been operating in and to have these kinds of results. ", "Second quarter, as you have seen was a very strong principal investing quarter, a new record, some direct realizations that exceed expectations and were sooner than expected. But beyond that, our overall investment banking origination results were very strong with a new record, a particular strength in syndications, our global rates business and really across the board near record results in several other businesses. ", "One metric we watch closely as we continue to build our platform is the addition of new clients, and we continue to show great progress on that with new lead bank relationships continue to track very positively. Our asset-based lending business also had a record quarter, very strong origination results across the whole platform and very good asset management. ", "Not shown in those numbers but echoing some of Don's comments is how well our team has manage our business in some tumultuous times. I attribute that to a culture that we have here; it's very integrated operating model with origination and product execution and distribution and risk management working very closely together to properly balance the decisions about businesses presented to us and how we manage the risk associated with it. ", "But very quickly on a couple of key markets there's sub-prime and CDO businesses which Don touched on. As he said we have avoided origination side of sub-prime for sometime. We don't have that origination platform. Plus when we have brought platforms in it did have sub-prime activities over the last 18 to 24 months. We have purposely exited that portion of the business. ", "Furthermore, as you know we are one of the larger players in the CDO business and in that market we have managed that exposure also extremely well. Some indicators of that would include the recent rating agency actions that have been taken. If you look at the exposure of our deals in those deals that have been mentioned, I think you'll find that we have among the best performance of... amongst our peer group in that particular business. So we've had nominal P&L impact from that market in our overall P&L and given where we are today we feel very good about that that will continue to be the case going forward. And our warehouse positions in that business are down substantially from where they have been. ", "Leveraged finance obviously is also a very important part of our business that we have been investing in. We have made a lot of progress in that business over the last couple of years and in particular we have focused on some of the large sponsors. ", "I do believe that we have also proven that we have managed that carefully to grow the business but accurately assess the risks, and we are very pleased with our current position. Again I don't need to repeat what Don said but we've made progress in the market we have not... that we have done it without taking on a lot of retained risk and relative to where the market is we feel very good about where we stand. ", "The deals that... we do have in our pipeline we don't regret any of them. Obviously there is some impact on potential profitability as those deals go through the execution phase but we feel very good about the sponsors who are doing work with and the transactions we've selected out of that pipeline. ", "Looking forward, our pipelines remain at or near record levels. Obviously certainty of timing of closure has gone down since 30, 60 days ago. But we really do feel good about where we stand in particular given the fact that we have dodged some of the issues that are out there. We feel we are in a very good position to take advantage of our position and be more offensive in a better priced market and pick up market share. ", "G. Kennedy Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Steve. I will ask Stan Kelly to talk about Wealth Management. ", "Stanhope A. Kelly - Senior Executive Vice President and President of Wealth Management", "Thank you, Ken. Our outlook in the Wealth Management group for the balance of the year is particularly positive in several areas throughout the division. Our new business pipelines in investment management and in our lending business are both at all time highs. We are particularly pleased with that. ", "Our expansion markets in Texas and to the Northeast are achieving strong year-over-year growth and in particular our Manhattan team which is a new team, two to three years ago is amongst our top performing teams in the business with strong double digit year-over-year growth. ", "Another one of our business is our Calibre business which serves the ultra high net-worth segment is having their best year by far, having one new business with several very large new families through the country. They are enjoying strong double digit year-over-year revenue growth as well, and we look for great prospects going forward in that group. ", "Also our client loyalty scores also hit a all-time high in the quarter. ", "Finally, we are particularly pleased with our prospects and the performance of the private advisory group. This is the group that is transitioning from the General Bank to the Wealth Management group. And our new client acquisition continues to be very strong there, and we have just announced in the last several weeks new leadership throughout the country to also include new leadership in California that was announced just yesterday. So, several favorable trends throughout the business, these positive trends are balanced with the softness in insurance business and with deposit business. But our outlook is very favorable looking forward. Thank you, Ken. ", "G. Kennedy Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Stan. And now David Carroll, Capital Management. ", "David M. Carroll - Head of Capital Management Group", "Thanks Ken. So, like Steve and everybody else we are coming off of a very strong quarter in our brokerage asset management and retirement businesses with operating earnings up 31% years to year. In fact this is the Capital Management group's sixth consecutive quarter of at least 20% operating earnings growth. ", "The fundamentals driving that will remain in place. So we've got a lot of momentum going into the second half of the year. In brokerage we are seeing strong client assets growth 3% up linked quarter in 13% year-to-year. The key managed account category is up 24% year-to-year but still it only about 19% of total AUMs, so we have room to run there. ", "FA productivity is up 11% year-over-year. The sale of CIB products, products that are underwritten in our corporate investment bank and sold by brokerage are up 19% on a linked quarter and a 112% year-over-year. In fact, through the first six months of this year our combined revenue generated about $309,000 million is 88% of the total generated last year. So we see more momentum there, and we have a very busy equity syndicate calendar for the rest of the year. ", "As Tom mentioned earlier, in brokerage we are also seeing nice growth in advisor headcount. We were up about 1% in the quarter. We hired 270 advisors in the second quarter, and the average productivity of our new hires is about 41% better than for the advisors that are attriting. ", "In asset management, we had a very good quarter, strong revenue growth up 16% linked and 44% year-over-year reflecting in part the acquisition of European Credit Management. They have seen nice growth in AUM from about $26 billion in AUM to over $39 billion at quarter end, and MetWest that we closed on a year ago large cap intrinsic value manager AUM is up 71% year-over-year. ", "And so again for that part of the second half of the year that we have control over, we feel very good about the strategies that are in place that are driving top-line growth. A.G. Edwards is much on our mind. It's going well. In terms of integration we have our integration organization in place. We were on the ground in St. Louis within four days of announcement. ", "In terms of timing with this integration, we would be where we were with Wachovia in first union [ph] after about four months, and we are seven weeks into this. With respect to Wachovia Securities and Prudential comparing the progression there we were actually after seven weeks or about where we were at six months. So we've refined the process and we're taking advantage of our experience there. But we feel... feel pretty good about the second half. ", "G. Kennedy Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Operator, I think we have given a pretty full review and we are now ready to answer questions. ", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Fitzsimmons with Sandler O'Neill. ", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "Good morning everyone. ", "G. Kennedy Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Kevin. ", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "On the... the subject of the trading and principal investing I heard what you said about comparing first half of the year versus the first half last year. But can you give us a little bit of a glimpse on how we should be looking at this going forward? I know in the past I think you used to talk about a 150 kind of average type of run rate in this and just looking at the pipelines of business where do you think those line items go over the next few quarters? Thanks. ", "Stephen E. Cummings - Head, Corporate and Investment Banking", "Yes, Kevin this is Steve Cummings. Principal investing we've said that we've consistently exceeded that in the environment we've been in. Our balances of invest... total investments are approaching $2 billion and so you can do some your on math that what you might expect the returns out of that. But we feel like we have good visibility into the third quarter and markets staying in reasonable shape here that we expect another solid quarter in principal investing in the third quarter. Beyond that I would revert to the kind of guidance that we've given you in the past. But it's a very unpredictable number, and I wish we could give you a better clarity on than we've been able to do. ", "On the trading we did have a good quarter. We had... across the board solid turnaround and our positive... particularly positive in our rates businesses and structured products. And I'd say that it was above normalized expectations but the business is growing and don't feel like it was an extraordinarily large quarter in that regard. Tom, I don't know if you have anything add to that. ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, I think that's fair to say in the rates business, we need some volatility to be successful. We've had volatility and turned that into bottom line profitability. So I feel pretty good in that front. ", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "But just based on where you are, what you are seeing right now so far in this quarter we shouldn't necessarily be expecting a dramatic fall off, but not necessarily this kind of linked quarter growth as well. Is that fair to say? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I would say, I wouldn't expect a dramatic fall off. ", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay. And one quick follow up. Can you give us a little bit of an update on how the cross selling to Golden West customers is going? I think that something that you've emphasized in the past and I just want to get an update there. Thanks. ", "Benjamin P. Jenkins III - Vice Chairman and President of the General Bank", "Kevin, this is Ben Jenkins. I'll be glad to... on the mortgage side, we have mortgage consultancy in our branches and about... their progression was up nicely in the second quarter, was up over 50% above the first quarter and about 20% of that production is of the think Golden West payment option product. If you look at the legacy Wachovia, mortgage consultant about 10% of their production is now from the payment option World product. ", "If you look at the World mortgage consultants 3% to 5% of their production would be in the marketable or saleable product that Wachovia introduced because the branches and retails centers, it continues to be another great story. We had in the quarter a net checking number of about 37,000, net checking account sold by the Golden West or World Savings team in those retail offices. The accounts continue to look very attractive. They about 30% larger in the accounts for opening on the East Coast and the DDA component of that is actually greater than the DDA component on in the East Coast. So, there was this more DDA as opposed to interest checking from those accounts. ", "So, in all accounts we're getting traction. We are very pleased and we think those numbers will continue to be very attractive. We would expect to see a little bit of fall off over the checking sales in third quarter perhaps as those individuals go through a lot of training to get ready for the fourth quarter deposit conversion in the Western half of United States. ", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Hi. I know you don't give NIM guidance any more but I just wanted to understand, if you could talk a little bit about some of the major drivers of the decline this quarter and the degree which you think changes in bond pricing recently have changed your own internal outlook? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hey Betsy, this is Tom. With respect to recent changes in the level of bond market that doesn't in the short term have a material impact. Because of this reason you will need to re-invest at possibly higher rates and this indicates a very small fraction of the total asset portfolio there. ", "Really, there is a number of things, as the trading portfolio was up, structured product warehouses were up. We started a bank in Ireland that will ultimately house capital market activities in Europe and initially the asset side of that looks like a lot of very low spread assets that over time will be replaced with more customer driven assets. And so that was another drag on the margin. ", "And so that... as well as just some things are kind of moving in and out as benefits are detrimental [ph], put more pressure on it this quarter than I would have guessed as we entered the quarter. But I don't... as I have mentioned in my prepared comments I would expect that you will see a little bit of a rebound and so I wouldn't expect that you'll see continued degradation in the market. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Was the European activities with that new bank that you put in Ireland the bulk of the trading asset increase? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, it's opened international commercial loans. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Where that will show up. Again at this point they are very low spread assets that, over time we have to put something in place to again to build the operations capability of FP and so forth. I hope that will be replaced with core activity. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay thanks. And then on CMBS, I think in the prepared remarks there was a comment about how you have gone through the whole portfolio and you feel very comfortable. I think that's the words you used and that you don't see credit deterioration in there. Could you just give us a sense as to what you did to come to those conclusions and what the announcement is based on? ", "G. Kennedy Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "On the loan, do you want to take that? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes,again the... in the commercial real estate markets, we really have not seen any credit deterioration. The issue that's been out there in the market is collateral that was originated at market pricing before this shift we've seen in the last few weeks and then from a re-pricing standpoint how is that collateral set. And so, we have gone through to revaluate focus as we mark that book. And because the volumes are lower we just don't really see an issue in that book. My point is I mean we are not really seeing any credit deterioration there. It's been a matter of pricing and hedging strategies we've had in place as well as the size and just a velocity through the warehouses, has some pretty good shape. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "When you say that volumes are lower, are you talking about the forward volumes? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, in other words, the build in new volumes as we clear about at the warehouse, and it's just the market is... the markets to a prior collateral is still catching up with where market pricing is on issuance. So it's just tougher right now to find good collaterals put in the warehouse temperature [ph]. ", "Benjamin P. Jenkins III - Vice Chairman and President of the General Bank", "And I'd add to that, that on the fixed rate side, we are pricing to what we think is current market, and we don't believe the entire market has moved to that. So we're not planning as many deals. Our fixed rate, I mean our floating rate activities still continue to show good and in fact are growing. So, we think that market just got to be calibrated here. ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In fact, one other point I would make is, this collaterals originated, it's intended for a specific deal to the extent it doesn't make it into that. It's referred to as variant pool, and that stuff is marked-to-market and then marketed for sale immediately. So, the results for the second quarter reflect that valuation of anything that didn't make it into the intended securitization? ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And you are basically saying that on the underlying payment stream from the real estate is not what's driving this market but it's the valuation that the buyers are putting on it? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "There'stwo things that there is a temporary disconnect between the rates at which customers are accustomed to paying on the loans originated and what investors are demanding. And then second of all during the second quarter or late first quarter the rating agencies readdressed their view of a lot of securitization activities but asset coordination levels should be different. And so therefore that caused the capital structure of deals to be different and that puts pressure on profitability towards them as well. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and which part is marked to market, is variant pool you mentioned? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, any loan that's originated for intended securitization and it doesn't [ph] make it in there. We take it out mark to market and then we market it for sale. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And then the pieces that are... that you anticipate will be in the pool, gets mark to market at the time of issuance, they are right or at the term marketing? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. All right, thanks. ", "Operator", ": Your next question comes from the line of Jefferson Harralson with KBW. ", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Hey thanks. I wanted to ask about the syndicated warehouses. You mentioned that the warehouses are down pretty significantly from past levels, is that a risk reduction thing. I keep hearing about a big forward calendar and does that imply that there should be less revenues from the source in Q3 and beyond? ", "G. Kennedy Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think when we are talking about the levels being down we are referring more to some of our other structured product activities that our leveraged finance business activity has been high, and we have a good pipeline out there. I think what we were seeing was that... what we intended to say if it didn't come out right was that our exposure to that big forward pipeline is at the very much at the low end of where our peer group is and if don't have any funded bridges in place right now, and we all have a question about how that stuff clears. And I think we have a good view of what the future profitability will be. And yes that's an area that there could be some revenue impact. I will tell you though that from the leveraged finance business on our platform in terms of revenue is less than 5% and that's not all sponsor related. So, it's not something... like it something that is end point of major engines that we completely depended upon, it's an important business but not dominant. ", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Bear Stearns. ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Good morning. Just a couple of questions on Golden West up, the increase in residential mortgage non-performing assets, were those primarily from legacy Wachovia or from the Golden West book? ", "Donald K. Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "HiDavid, this Don. They were primarily in the Golden West book. ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "So, of that total $224 million or so there was a little over $200 million that actually was out of the legacy Golden West portfolio. And is there any particular geographic concentration to that? ", "Donald K. Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "There is a little bit of one in the Central Valley of California, so this is the Bay area basically around... between the Bay area and Sacramento. We are seeing some higher stress in those markets particularly on housing value. That is a market that appears to have gotten ahead of itself in terms of supply. I'll just give little bit a color. The average loan values or house value that we are lending against in there somewhere around 350,000 to 400,000. So, kind of it... we are not at the real high end by any means. But we are just saying absorption there take longer and this a lot has gotten out here. ", "The good news is that it is a very vibrant area. Job are good, the economy is strong and it's just a matter of absorbing the inventory out there we believe. But that would be... probably the one area that stands out in the portfolio right now that this team works with particular diligence ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Okay, and are you going to provide information on how much of the interest accrual reflected increase in principal balances on the pick-a-pay mortgages? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The deferred interest? ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Yes. ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes I don't think we have any relative bulk share that we're expecting right in line with where we've always had it or so. Yes right now apprehension about sharing that news. ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Okay. And then finally just in terms of the mortgage production, any general distinction or split between fixed and adjustable rate origination? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I am sorry. David, I was looking for the answer of your question so I didn't pay enough attention to your question you just asked. The answer to the deferred interest is a $2.3 billion which is right in line with the trend line with that and could you ask those questions again, Dave? ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "So on deferred interest, how much did it increase in the quarter? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "About $300 million. ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thanks very much for that and the other question was just a sort of the sense of how the mortgage origination was split between fixed rate and adjustable rate? ", "Thomas J. Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Over time we've seen a pattern of migration away from adjustable rate fixed rate. We introduced fixed pick-a-pay. We have introduced a kind of a hybrid as a fixed component of three years and turns into a traditional pick-a-pay ARM. And so you have seen a continued migration towards more on the fixed products. Our margins are about the same for us on either products. So we don't have a strong bias as to which costumers are a lag but you're probably getting close to 50/50 or something like that. ", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns", "Great, thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen we have reached allotted time for question, and your final question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB research LLC. ", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Good morning guys. Couple of questions here. Don, could you just... I mean I know you have been warning us that this increase in residential real estate non-performers was coming but it just seemed to sort of leap ahead. I mean is this going to be sort of continuous level of increase that you see here or is this going to be lumpy around reset periods etcetera? ", "Donald K. Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Nancy I think... I don't know the reset periods will have anything to do with what we are seeing again given the nature of the product with payment caps and the like. My anticipation would be that some of this is being driven just by seasoning of the portfolio that, it won't necessarily be lumpy but it will be a trend for a few quarters and level off that's what I would expect. ", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Okay, great. David question for you, my understanding is that retention payments of Wachovia Securities are that the brokers on Wachovia Securities side are receiving retention payments as well as are the A.G. Edwards brokers that you don't want to lose. Are those payments... number one if you could just give the philosophy behind that and are those payments to the Wachovia Securities brokers included in the merger charges for A. G. Edwards? ", "David M. Carroll - Head of Capital Management Group", "Yes and yes. They are receiving them, they are included in the merger charges and they would be embedded in the results that we've predicted when we announced the transaction. They are less generous if you will for a comparable level of production on Wachovia side. But the logic in it is and as much as we are combining these firms and moving the headquarters, there were some concerns out there on the part of advisors not so much us in the management, that they would be impacted by it. And so it was that provides some calming influence of our people. And so far the results have been really good. ", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Okay.And Ken, I have to ask this question because I am getting. ", "David M. Carroll - Head of Capital Management Group", "I amsorry really quick, we did the same thing in Prudential too so this was a different experience. ", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Okay. Ken I need to ask this question because I am getting it a lot from clients, I mean knowing what you know now about the mortgage market and the impact that some of the concerns about mortgage you've had on your stock price, would you still do the Golden West deal? ", "G. Kennedy Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we're going to be happy that we did this deal long term. We're going to be happy that we did this because of the experience that we're having in the West as we used the branches that we acquired and I think on the mortgage side this product is... this pick-a-pay product is going to be very attractive when yield curves go back to normal and as the housing market comes out of recovery. So yes we're going through a little pain with it now but I think a year out, 18 months out, two years out we are going to be very happy that we did this deal. ", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And now I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. ", "G. Kennedy Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you operator and I will just close by thanking you all for being with us. I think we are... we are pleased with this quarter. We think it is a solid growth quarter and I think I am most pleased with the quarter because we are growing and we are doing it in a very conservative way. And I hope we got that across as we talk about what we are doing in credit and in managing everything going on in structured products and then the re-pricing of asset classes that we are pleased with it.

The third quarter was a challenging quarter forthe industry with the downturn in the national housing market, deterioration inthe capital markets, a widening credit spreads, increases in market volatilityand changes in interest rates. While Wells Fargo is not immune to theenvironment, the diversity of our business model and our long-standing financialdiscipline resulted in solid quarterly results with a 6% increase in earnings pershare to a record $0.68 per share, double-digit revenue growth, driven bydouble-digit growth in loans, double-digit growth in core deposits, and double-digitgrowth in fee income, and continued strong operating margins including positiveoperating leverage.

Muchof the linked quarter declines in both insurance and real estate brokerage feeswere offset by related declines in expenses in these two businesses.", "Our capital market activities showed good results in thequarter and were largely not impacted by the credit crunch or market dislocation.We have not significantly participated in any of the recently publicized largeleveraged buyouts; we did not create any structured investment vehicles to holdoff-balance sheet assets and have no current plans to do so; exposure to CDOsis minimal; we have no direct exposure to hedge funds; we have never made marketsin sub-prime mortgage securities and consequently did not need to write-down anyof that kind of debt security; commercial mortgages originated and held forsale were about $1.5 billion on average and experienced negligible losses inthe quarter; our modest high yield bond portfolio is well diversified, washedged and incurred minimal net losses; and we wrote down commercial loans heldfor sale by $20 million in our securities investment business, recorded inother non-interest income. ", "Our Community Banking Group, which includes regionalbanking, wealth management, mortgage banking and retail Internet, had a goodquarter with 12% revenue growth and 8% earnings growth from the third quarter of2006. ", "Regional banking, serving 11 million households, achieved arecord cross-sell of 5.5 products per household, up from 5.1 products a yearago and up from around three products in 1998. Twenty-two percent of our retailcustomers had over eight products with us, our long-term goal, up from around12% five years ago, and in our top region, 31% of our customers had over eightproducts with us.", "During the third quarter, core product sales were a record $5.25million, up 9% from prior year on a comparable basis. California continued tobe one of our fastest growing states with a 16% increase in core product salesfrom the third quarter of 2006 on a comparable basis. ", "Sales of Wells Fargo Packages, which include a checkingaccount and at least three other products, such as a debit card, credit card, asavings account or a home equity loan, were up 13% from third quarter 2006 and werepurchased by 69% of new checking account customers. ", "Increased customer penetration and usage of credit and debitcards grew card fee income by 21% from the third quarter of 2006 and 34% annualizedon a linked-quarter basis. At quarter-end, 37% of our retail bank consumerhouseholds had a Wells Fargo credit card, up from 34% a year ago and up from 24%five years ago. Purchase volume on these cards was up 20% from a year ago andaverage balances were up 27%. ", "Ninety-one percent of our consumer checking accountcustomers had a debit card, up from 85% five years ago and purchase volumeincreased by 11% from a year ago. Wells Fargo\u2019s best-in-class Rewards suite forour credit and debit card customers has contributed to both our growth inbalances and to purchase volume. In addition, customers are finding our patentpending MySpendingReport a helpful tool for understanding and managing theirspending. ", "Average core deposits of $306 billion included certain fundsthat were previously swept into non-deposit products. Including only the growthin these funds from the date of their conversion to deposits, or only depositsthat were new to Wells Fargo, average core deposits grew 11% from a year agoand 7% annualized on a linked-quarter basis. ", "Average mortgage escrow deposits were up $3 billion from thethird quarter of 2006 and down $1 billion from the second quarter of 2007.Excluding mortgage escrow balances, total average core deposits grew 13% from thethird quarter of 2006 and 9% annualized on a linked quarter basis. ", "Average retail core deposits, which exclude wholesalebanking and mortgage escrow deposits, were up 7% from a year ago and 1% annualizedon a linked quarter basis. The average balance per retail account declined slightlyin the third quarter as consumers were forced to pay higher interest on theirloans. However, we continued to have good account growth, positioning us wellfor the future. ", "Consumer checking accounts were up a net 4.8% from last yearand small business checking accounts were up a net 4.3% from last year.California continued to be our fastest growing market, with checking accountsup a net 5.9%. This is the ninth consecutive quarter where net new accounts inCalifornia exceeded the average across our footprint. ", "While some of our competitors in California increased theirdeposit rates during the quarter, we have not. We nevertheless have continued togrow accounts by offering our customers better service and more convenience.Although we did not raise rates on our deposit products during the thirdquarter and actually reduced rates early in the fourth quarter in response tothe Fed rate cut, our overall average cost of deposits increased during thethird quarter as the growth in interest bearing checking and savings accounts andconsumer CDs continued to exceed the growth in non-interest bearing accounts, atrend that is consistent with the national monetary aggregates.", "Small business continues to be one of our best opportunitiesfor growth. Sales of store-based business solutions were up 16% from last yearon a comparable basis. Sales of Wells Fargo Business Services Packages, whichincludes a business checking account and at least three other business products,such as a business debit card, business credit card, business savings accountor business loan or line of credit, were up 31% and purchased by 43% of newbusiness checking account customers. ", "These strong sales results increased our cross-sell to ourbusiness banking households to 3.5, up from 3.2 a year ago. Bank loans to smallbusinesses, loans less than $100,000 on our Business Direct platform, grew 19% fromthird quarter of 2006. From December 2005 to August 2007, in-footprint singleproduct small business households declined from 29.5% to 24.1% of total smallbusiness households, an 18% improvement. ", "We continued to focus on delivering a great experience forour customers and measuring our progress through 50,000 store-based customersurveys a month, over 1.9 million surveys to date. For customers transacting atthe teller line, welcoming and wait time scores improved 16% and customerloyalty scores have improved 9% from third quarter 2006.", "Our Wealth Management Group had an outstanding quarter withrevenue up 20% and earnings up 24% from a year ago. These results were drivenby double digit non-interest income, deposit and loan growth. Strong tradingactivity by our customers increased brokerage revenue by 31% and net incomeincreased 51% from the third quarter of 2006. ", "Brokerage assets under administration reached record levels,increasing 15% from a year ago. WellsTrade, our on-line brokerage service, introducednew pricing during the first quarter offering 100 commission-free online tradesper year for Wells Fargo PMA customers. This relationship-based pricing offerhas increased new account openings by 15%, our self-directed assets under administrationby 52% and revenue by 36% since the third quarter of 2006. ", "Wells Fargo continues to be a leader in retail onlinebanking. At quarter-end, we had 9.5 million active online consumers, up 14% froma year ago. Sixty-four percent of all Wells Fargo consumer checking accountcustomers are now active online customers. We had 950,000 active online smallbusiness customers, up 19% from a year ago.

", "During the quarter, we launched Wells Fargo Mobile forconsumers and small business customers, allowing them to use the browser ontheir web-enabled mobile device to check account balances, view transactionhistory and transfer funds between Wells Fargo accounts.", "We\u2019ll now talk about mortgage banking. Notwithstanding thesharp downturn in the housing sector, the widening of nonconforming creditspreads and the lack of liquidity in the nonconforming secondary markets, our mortgagebanking results in the third quarter were relatively strong overall. Ourlongstanding responsible lending practices and policies, our leadership role inthe industry, our risk management discipline and most importantly, the balancewe have in our mortgage business with complementary origination and servicingstrengths, enabled us to continue to grow revenue in the third quarter while atthe same time reducing risk. ", "Throughout the market turmoil, Wells Fargo remained open forbusiness and our reputation, commitment to the mortgage business, and financialstrength became particularly attractive to more homeowners, more real estateagents, more builders and other referral sources. ", "At $95 billion, mortgage applications were down $19 billionon a linked-quarter basis, in part due to typical seasonal declines in thepost-spring home buying season, but were actually the same volume ofapplications as the year0ago quarter. ", "At $68 billion, originations were similarly down about 15% ona linked-quarter basis, with most of the decline in originations occurring inthe correspondent and wholesale channels as we exited the non-primecorrespondent channel in the second quarter, exited the non-prime wholesalechannel in the third quarter, and adjusted pricing on most nonconforming wholesaleand correspondent mortgage products throughout the quarter.", "Less than half of our total originations have typically beenthrough the wholesale and correspondent channels, compared with typically 70% ormore non-retail for the larger peer competitors. ", "We remained one of the nation\u2019s leading retail mortgageoriginators with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage retail originations totaling $29billion, the same volume as a year ago and down only 9% on a linked-quarterbasis. ", "The secondary market for agency-conforming mortgagesfunctioned well for most of the quarter. However, with overall secondary marketspreads widening, gain on sale margins worsened for most of the quarter, butmargins have since improved slightly. ", "The warehouse and pipeline, which is predominately primemortgages, was written down by $378 million in the quarter to reflect theunusual widening in largely non-conforming versus conforming secondary marketspreads. Many of these assets were then securitized and a large portionretained as securities in our available for sale investment portfolio at very attractiveyields. None of these new securities are collateralized by sub-prime loans. ", "In addition to the warehouse markdown, mortgage originationgains were reduced by $112 million, primarily to reflect a write-down ofrepurchased mortgage loans and an increase in the repurchase reserve.", "The decline in mortgage origination fees was more than madeup by higher servicing revenue, once again demonstrating the value of ourbalanced mortgage business model. Mortgage servicing income grew due to volume,the owned servicing portfolio of $1.5 trillion at quarter-end was up 11% from ayear ago, and also due to strong hedging results. ", "While servicing income was reduced by $638 million due tothe impact of over a 30 basis point decline in 30-year mortgage rates on themarket value of MSRs during the quarter, the gain on the economic hedge of theMSR was $1.2 billion. ", "Three factors contributed to this solid net hedging result.First, the same widening of mortgage spreads due to illiquidity and marketestimates of slower prepayments that negatively impacted the value of themortgage warehouse positively impacted the value of the MSR asset. ", "Second, we positioned ourselves during the height of the MBSmarket turmoil to benefit from a flight to quality by holding proportionatelymore of our economic hedges of the MSR in non-mortgage-backed security instrumentslike Treasury futures and options, swaps and options on swaps. We were able toreverse this positioning and lock in the flight-to-quality gains as the MBSmarket recovered later in the quarter. ", "And third, on balance we maintained a proportionately largereconomic hedge on the MSR asset in part due to the replacement of MBSsecurities, which are recorded in debt securities results, with off-balancesheet economic hedges, which are accounted for in mortgage hedging results.", "At September 30, the ratio of capitalized MSR to the totalamount of mortgages serviced for others was 1.35%, the lowest ratio in eightquarters. Finally, we continued to reduce expenses in the mortgage business,with expenses down 20% annualized on a linked quarter basis, and in the processwe incurred approximately $14 million in severance and related shut-down costs.", "Let me now shift to credit quality. Net credit lossesincreased to $892 million, or 1.01% of average loans annualized, up from $720million in the second quarter of 2007. Almost half of the increase in netcredit losses was concentrated in the home equity portfolio. ", "As indicated previously, we have been projecting higher homeequity credit losses for a while, although losses in this portfolio acceleratedin the third quarter due to the steeper-than-anticipated decline in nationalhome prices. The remainder of the increase in credit losses was concentrated inthe auto portfolio, largely due to typical seasonal factors, with modestincreases in unsecured consumer credit portfolios, largely due to growth. ", "Total nonperforming assets were $3.18 billion or 0.88% ofloans in the third quarter, compared with $2.72 billion or 0.79% of loans inthe second quarter. Our nonperforming loan portfolio continued to haverelatively low loss potential based on the high percentage of consumer, realestate and auto-secured loans, where we take an initial write-down to estimatednet realizable value as the loan is transferred to nonperforming status. ", "Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, excludinginsured and guaranteed GNMA balances, increased by $177 million from the secondquarter. This increase is concentrated in our consumer real estate and unsecuredportfolios and is consistent with the increases in nonperforming and net creditlosses previously mentioned.", "I\u2019d like to start by focusing on our exposure to the realestate market. Our first mortgage portfolio continued to perform very well inthe third quarter, with annualized losses of 0.11%, down from 0.13% in thesecond quarter; only $16 million in third quarter losses on the entire $67billion first mortgage portfolio. ", "The $67 billion of first mortgages that were on our balancesheet at September 30, 2007, consisted primarily of $23 billion of debtconsolidation loans at Wells Fargo Financial, $12 billion of home equity loansin the first mortgage position, and $31 billion of largely prime customers,relationship-based first mortgages held at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, regionalbanking, and our Wealth Management Group. ", "While our disciplined underwriting standards have resultedin first mortgage delinquencies considerably below industry levels, wecontinued to tighten our underwriting standards in the third quarter. ", "Wells Fargo Home Mortgage closed the non-prime wholesale channelearly in the quarter, after closing the non-prime correspondent channel in thesecond quarter. Pricing was increased for nonconforming mortgage loans duringthe quarter, reflecting the reduced liquidity in the capital markets.", "At quarter-end, Wells Fargo Financial had $24 billion inU.S. based real estate-secured debt consolidation loans. These loans are fordebt consolidation purposes, not for the purchase of a home. This means ourcustomers are not incurring significant new financial obligations and in fact,their total monthly credit payments are typically lower than they were prior totaking out the debt consolidation loan. ", "Ninety-six percent of this portfolio is in a first lienposition. Annualized net charge-offs at quarter end in this portfolio were lessthan 20 basis points, with third quarter losses of only $10 million. ", "Our delinquency and foreclosure rates for this portfolioremained significantly better than published industry rates for non-primemortgage portfolios. This portfolio continued to perform better than the restof the industry\u2019s non-prime mortgage portfolios because of the nature of theproduct, the type of customers who buy this product, as well as the longstandingdiscipline with which these loans have always been underwritten and managed atWells Fargo.", "Wells Fargo Financial has not originated any interest only,stated income, option ARMs or negative amortizing residential real estateloans. All U.S. based debt consolidation loans are originated by Wells FargoFinancial team members; we do not use any brokers or correspondents in thisbusiness. ", "Wells Fargo Financial does not do any national advertisingcampaigns. New real estate customers primarily come from outbound calling tocustomers with an existing Wells Fargo relationship and where we can clearly demonstratea tangible benefit for our customers by improving their financial situations throughdebt consolidation. ", "We conservatively underwrite these loans with full documentationand require income verification. The average FICO score on this portfolio was642 and 64% of the portfolio had a FICO above 620. The average loan-to-value was77%. The average loan size was $127,000. Approximately 46% of the portfolio wasfixed rate loans. ", "The remaining loans were 3-27 adjustable rate mortgages witha fixed payment for the first three years of the loan. We underwrite theseadjustable rate loans to the fully indexed rate to ensure the customer\u2019sability to afford their payments. In the third quarter, 57% of new originationswere fixed rate loans. This prudent product strategy, combined with cautiousunderwriting has resulted in stable and predictable credit performance. ", "Our National Home Equity Group manages a portfolio of $83billion in home equity loans, including the $12 billion that are in firstposition. Net credit losses in the third quarter for the National Home EquityGroup were $157 million, or 0.77% of average loans annualized, up $68 millionfrom the second quarter when losses were 0.44% of loans annualized. ", "The increase in losses in this portfolio is primarily aseverity issue, not a frequency issue, and is concentrated in the highestcombined LTV loans. The increase in severity reflects the decline in national homeprices, with certain markets in the Midwest and California\u2019s Central Valleyseeing some more stress. ", "The difference between frequency and severity is mostclearly demonstrated by the fact that while our losses increased, 98.7% of ourhome equity customers were still paying us on time. ", "The majority of the home equity portfolio, which would be loansoriginated through our retail stores or through cross-sell with Wells FargoHome Mortgage, had a slight increase in losses but within acceptable rangesthat are consistent with our risk-based pricing structure. ", "The bulk of the actual deterioration in the home equity portfoliohas come from our Correspondent channel, where we purchased closed loans fromthird party originators. Specifically, correspondent home equity loansrepresented about 7% of our total home equity loans outstanding but accountedfor 25% of our third quarter home equity losses with an annualized loss rate inexcess of 3%. ", "As this adverse trend emerged, we tightened credit standardsearlier in 2007 and completely eliminated this channel during the thirdquarter. Correspondent loans represented less than 7% of Wells Fargo\u2019s homeequity volume in the first half of 2007. ", "In response to the decline in the housing market, theNational Home Equity Group has taken a number of actions to adjust pricing and totighten credit standards, including reducing the maximum loan-to-value for allsales channels. However given the current real estate market conditions, creditlosses in the home equity portfolio are likely to increase in the fourth quarterand remain elevated into 2008.", "While we do not retain any significant credit risk on our$1.4 trillion residential mortgage servicing portfolio, which serves over 10million first mortgage and home equity loans, we closely monitor the creditperformance of this portfolio. ", "Over 90% of the mortgage loans we service are for primecustomers. We value and price our servicing based on expected repaymentperformance, so that we are properly compensated for the added work related topotentially higher delinquency in the sub-prime portfolios. We also priceservicing based on the origination channel, with better credit performance inour retail originations versus third party origination channels. ", "While delinquencies and foreclosures are increasing, only 0.66%of our servicing portfolio -- in other words, less than 1% -- was in foreclosureat quarter end, which is below the industry average.", "We work hard at keeping people in their homes. In fact,Wells Fargo last week helped to launch the national HOPENOW alliance to reachat-risk homeowners facing difficulty in making their payments. The allianceincludes mortgage servicers, counselors and capital market investors. ", "Making contact with at-risk borrowers is our biggestchallenge. Throughout the industry, of those consumers who lose a home toforeclosure, around 50% have never been in contact with their mortgageservicer. When contact occurs at the first sign of trouble, before the weightof past due payments, we have a greater chance of helping our customers find options.", "We are reaching out to ARM customers 6 months prior to resetwith proactive calls and letters and have established a dedicated toll-free numberso customers can connect easily with a Wells Fargo team member. In the last 18 months,we have doubled our team members that directly assist customers with active effortsto help find workout solutions. ", "Credit losses in our $28 billion auto portfolio increaseddue primarily to expected seasonality in the second half of the year. Net autolosses increased $57 million from the prior quarter. Year over year, net autolosses were down $32 million, demonstrating that credit performance hasstabilized as we continue to refine the indirect auto business model. ", "Delinquencies have increased due to seasonality, but loans90 days past due and still accruing continued to improve and were down 9% fromsecond quarter and down 42% from the fourth quarter peak. Over 70% of the autoportfolio had a FICO score above 620. The size of our auto portfolio wasessentially unchanged from last quarter, reflecting tightening of accountacquisition strategies to reduce loan volume in higher risk tiers. Nearly 80% ofnew originations in the third quarter had a FICO score above 620.", "Two other retail portfolios that are important to our creditperformance are credit card and business direct. The $11 billion communitybanking credit card portfolio was primarily issued to our banking customerswithin our banking states. Our $11 billion business direct portfolio consistsof small loans and lines of credit originated to small business owners nationwide.", "These businesses continue to produce healthy loan growth andexecute underwriting, account management and collection practices withpredictable results within acceptable risk parameters, typically better thanindustry norms. ", "Delinquency and net credit losses are modestly higher due toslightly higher consumer bankruptcy rates and the continued pressure of theweak residential real estate market on these unsecured portfolios.", "Our commercial and commercial real estate portfolioscontinued to produce strong credit performance and healthy loan growth. Thissegment of our lending business is benefiting from our focus on deep andlong-term relationships with middle market customers, regional commercial realestate and geographically diverse small business lending. ", "Our $5.9 billion residential one to four family constructionand land development loan portfolio, which is less than 2% of total loans,continues to perform satisfactorily and has experienced only isolated and smallproblems. ", "We placed $97 million in loans to one large California residentialdeveloper on non-accrual in the third quarter, after working closely with the customerfor over a year. The $124 million increase in commercial and commercial real estatenon-accrual loans primarily reflects this one loan.", "Let me now shift to capital management and balance sheetmanagement. On September 30, shareholders equity was $48 billion, up $3 billionfrom $45 billion a year ago. Our leverage, tier I capital, and total capitalratios were 7.29%, 8.21%, and 11.11% respectively. ", "Our capital ratios remained very strong, reflecting ourongoing focus on producing high risk-adjusted returns in all of our activitiesand in turn, giving us capacity to continue to take advantage of attractivegrowth opportunities to produce strong returns for our shareholders.", "In the third quarter, we repurchased 60 million shares ofWells Fargo common stock. Year to date, we have repurchased 137 million shares,all but 11 million of which have been used to complete the acquisition ofPlacer Sierra Bancshares and Greater Bay Bancorp and for employee stock optionexercises, 401(k) matched contributions and other employee benefit plans. ", "At September 30, 49 million shares remained available for repurchaseunder Board authority.", "Our merger and acquisition strategy remains focused on nicheopportunities adding to stockholder value. We will not do any acquisitionsunless they meet our longstanding financial criteria for accretion and returns.", "On October 1st, we completed the acquisition of Greater Bay Bancorp,with $7.4 billion in assets, and the third largest bank acquisition in ourCompany\u2019s history. With 41 banking stores across the San Francisco Bay Area,Greater Bay will enable us to better serve our community banking, commercialinsurance brokerage, specialty finance and trust customers. Given thechallenging environment, we expect to see additional acquisition and portfoliopurchase opportunities. ", "Our preferred use of capital is to invest in our businesses,particularly to build and strengthen our distribution. In the third quarter of 2007,we opened 20 banking stores and converted 39 Placer Sierra Bancshares stores toour network, bringing our total retail store count to 3,283. ", "We continued to add to our ATM network, adding 49 newweb-enabled ATMs and converting 199 envelope-free ATMs during the quarter. Weadded 647 platform banker FTEs from the third quarter 2006.", "As indicated earlier in my remarks, the investmentsecurities portfolio, which had been increased in second quarter when yieldsrose, was reduced during the third quarter. Taking advantage of an opportunitybetween the spot MBS market and the forward securities market, the price ofabout $24 billion in mortgage-backed security sales was locked in through aforward sale rather than an outright sale of the particular securities. ", "While there was essentially no net impact on third quarterearnings from this combination of transactions, the modest decline in yieldsbetween the time of the forward sale and the delivery of the MBS to settle theforwards resulted in a commensurate gain on the underlying bonds, which was recognizedas gains in the available for sale securities line item, and offset by a lossin the forward hedge, which was reflected in other income trading. ", "As previously disclosed, the increase in average assets forthe quarter was the principle reason net interest margin declined in the thirdquarter. Late in the third quarter, $17 billion of new loans and securitieswere added at higher yields than the MBS securities that were sold, which willhelp fourth quarter net interest margin.", "The company did not issue any long-term debt in the quarterin view of the temporary impact of the market\u2019s dislocation on debt issuancecosts, which have since subsided. Temporarily elevated short-term LIBOR ratesat the peak of the dislocation adversely impacted short-term costs by about $15million. ", "In terms of our tax rate, there were no significant taxcosts or benefits in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 34% this quartercompared with 34% in second quarter, 33% year-to-date and 32% in the thirdquarter of 2006.", "In summary, in conclusion, while we are not immune to theslowdown in the housing market or the turbulent credit markets, our results inthe third quarter demonstrated the absolute and relative advantages of ourdiversified business model, long-standing financial discipline, conservativerisk management practices and strong balance sheet and capital ratios. We arewell positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities presented in thischallenging environment.", "Thank you for listening.

Kennedy Thompson", "This is Ken Thompson. The line got very staticky when you started talkingand I\u2019m wondering if you can check to see if people can hear me. Operator?", "Operator", "Yes, sir. You\u2019re good and clear.", "G. Kennedy Thompson", "Okay. Good.", "Alice Lehman", "Thanks for joining our call this morning. This is Alice Lehman from investorrelations. We hope you\u2019ve received our earnings release by now, as well as thesupplemental quarterly earnings report. If you haven\u2019t, both are available onour investor relations website at Wachovia.com/investor. ", "In this call, we\u2019ll review the first 16 pages of the quarterly earningsreport. In addition to this teleconference, this call is available through alisten-only live audio webcast.

He\u2019ll be followed by our CFO,Tom Wurtz, and our Chief Risk Officer, Don Truslow. We\u2019ll be happy to take yourquestions at the end. ", "Of course, before we begin I have a few reminders. First, any forward-lookingstatements made during this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.Factors that could cause Wachovia\u2019s results to differ materially from anyforward-looking statements are set forth in Wachovia\u2019s public reports filedwith the SEC including Wachovia\u2019s current report on Form 8-K filed today. ", "Second, some of the discussion about our company\u2019s performance today willinclude reference to non-GAAP financial measures. Information that reconcilesthose measures to GAAP measures can be found in our filings with the SEC and inthe news release and supplemental material located at Wachovia.com/investor.

Kennedy Thompson", "Good morning, everybody and I apologize for the problems we\u2019ve had with thetelephone line. I hope it\u2019s working okay now. I want to thank you all forjoining us on the call. Undoubtedly you\u2019ve already reviewed our earningsdocument and you know that in the third quarter we earned $1.7 billion or $0.89per common share, which is down 10% from the same quarter last year. ", "It\u2019s clearly been a challenging environment and the disruption in the globalfixed income markets has dominated much of our focus in the quarter.Unfortunately, the markets most affected by the disruption are those where wehave some of our most developed businesses in our corporate and investmentbanks. Specifically, those would be leveraged finance, structured products, andcommercial real estate securitization. Mark-to-market loses in those threebusinesses constituted approximately 90% of our net valuation losses of $1.3billion in the quarter.", "As you all know, we\u2019ve built very successful leverage finance and structuredproducts businesses that have produced strong results for us over the lastseveral years. In fact, in those two businesses they\u2019ve produced over $4billion in revenue in 2005 and 2006. While 2007\u2019s results will be materiallylower than that, I\u2019ve got confidence that we\u2019ll continue to grow thesebusinesses over the long term. The leaders of these businesses have made verygood strategic decisions while we were building the businesses and theycontinue to have my full confidence. ", "We\u2019ve built the number one ranked domestic CMDS business and leadingstructured products and leveraged finance businesses, and we have very strongtalent in place. We\u2019ve got plenty of capital and we\u2019ve got great liquidity togo forward in those businesses. ", "The shorter term outlook is less clear for the commercial real estatesecuritization business. The situation there is we have significant warehousepositions remaining in many of our competitors\u2019 balance sheets. Deal flow hasslowed and investors are skittish in the face of liquidity challenges. As aresult of that, we think that revenue from that business will be challengedover the next several quarters. ", "In response to that, we\u2019ve taken, and we\u2019re continuing to take, decisive stepson expenses through actions on head count, incentives, and discretionaryspending within our corporate and investment bank. But we remain firmlycommitted to these businesses and expect that over time they will perform wellin an environment where going forward, we\u2019re going to see much moreattractively priced risk. ", "Now moving outside our corporate and investment bank, our diversified modeland other fundamental strengths are continuing to serve us well. I\u2019m pleasedthat we continue to see good sales activity throughout our organization, andour lend and deposit trends were solid in the quarter. ", "Our general bank\u2019s earnings were up 3% linked quarter, even while wecompleted our Western State Branch conversion, which concluded this weekend andI\u2019m really happy to say that there were literally no serious glitches in thatintegration. We\u2019re very optimistic about our growth prospects in thesefast-growing western markets and we believe we\u2019re well positioned foropportunities in a now much less crowded mortgage industry. ", "We saw good retail checking account growth coming out of the Golden Westfranchise. In fact, World Savings Branches contributed 93,000 of the 832,000year-to-date growth in net new checking accounts. Equally impressive during thequarter was the performance in our capital management group. Even with noclosed end fund syndicate activity in this quarter and, even with a $40 millionevaluation loss on commercial paper investments, they generated 18%year-over-year growth, and their poised for even more success now that our newAG Edwards colleagues are on board. It\u2019s admittedly early days, but the AGEdwards integration is proceeding as we had planned to date.", "In our asset management business we took action to ensure investor confidencein our Evergreen Money Market Mutual Funds and we were rewarded withsubstantial inflows to our funds in the third quarter. ", "All of our businesses across Wachovia have battened down the hatches and arefocusing on controlling expenses. Outside of acquisition impact, there wasreally little expense growth at all in the third quarter. ", "In terms of asset quality, Don Truslow will share more details shortly, solet me just say that we are seeing weakening in some of our businesses from acredit standpoint. And as you have witnessed all week in other calls, this ishappening across the industry. ", "Trends in mortgage credit are deteriorating faster than we would haveexpected. Our statistics remain better for consumer assets than those of mostof our peers, but it\u2019s clear that we are in an environment of building reserves.Our provisions exceeded charge-offs by $200 million this quarter and it\u2019s notunlikely that a similar pattern may be required next quarter, not as a resultof actual losses, but due to a disconnect between historical experience andwhat we see today in NPA growth. ", "When all is said and done, of course I\u2019m deeply disappointed that ouroverall results for the quarter are not better. You can rest assured that wewill apply the lessons of the recent extraordinary market conditions to adjustour infrastructure and governance and make our company even stronger, but youwill not see substantial shifts in our business model. ", "I\u2019m confident our company is in the right businesses for the long term andthat our strategy of being in high growth businesses and markets, our laserfocus on customer service, our expense discipline, and our commitment to strongcredit risk management, will create value for our shareholders in the future. ", "Now, I\u2019m certain you\u2019re going to have many questions for us which we want tofully address, so now I\u2019m going to turn this over to Tom Wurtz, who will goover the results of the quarter in detail, and he\u2019ll also go over our outlookfor both the full year and the fourth quarter on its own. Tom.", "Thomas J. Wurtz", "Thank you, Ken. Good morning to everyone on the call. Thanks for joining us.I\u2019ll now turn to the quarterly earnings report document. So if I could ask youto turn to page 2, you can see the performance of our four business unitscompared to last quarter\u2019s results and compared to last year. Overall, we hadpretty solid results in core operations for three of the four segments. Thereare one-time issues which negatively impact the quarter results for wealthmanagement and CMG that tend to mask the underlying performance of thosebusinesses.", "You can see the general bank is up 3% on a linked quarter basis, or 12%annualized. It\u2019s both a good revenue story and a good expense story, which I\u2019llshare with you as we go forward. ", "Next you see wealth management, down 12%, but here essentially all thedecline is associated with the write-off a receivable in the insurancebusiness. The core activities were relatively flat linked quarter and there wasgood sales activity.", "The corporate investment bank is down 86% and we\u2019ll spend a fair amount oftime detailing the components of the writedowns that contributed to thoseresults, and also highlight some of the businesses exhibiting strength in thequarter. ", "Capital management, down 5% on a linked quarter. That is the result of $40million in marks taken out of commercial paper assets purchased out ofEvergreen Money Market Funds Ken referred to, and that was really during theheight of the market\u2019s illiquidity disruption. Absent this, results were upfrom a record second quarter and essentially up 29% year over year, so greatmomentum there. ", "Overall, revenues declined 16% from the second quarter, primarily as aresult of marks. A clear positive is the 2% increase in net interest income. Ithink we\u2019re in an environment now where NI growth will again be a driver ofrevenue growth, which is a nice change from the sluggish environment we\u2019ve beenover the last couple years.", "Interestingly, in the quarter we maintained extraordinary liquidity to beprepared to serve our customers very well and we were a source of liquidity ofthe entire industry during the period. The consequence of that is it balloonedthe balance sheet and impaired the capital ratio a little bit from thatstandpoint. Also, there\u2019s a negative drag on net interest margin and actuallycost us net interest income as we borrowed longer term at rates tied to LIBOR andessentially sold Fed funds overnight. But we thought it was the prudent andresponsible thing to do in that environment and we were able to sleep eachnight during the quarter, unlike probably some other folks.", "Fee income was down $1.4 billion as a result of asset marks and reallyoverwhelmed improvements in service charges, interchange income, fiduciary andasset management fees, and strong principal investing results. ", "We controlled expenses very well in response to the environment. Essentially,every category of expense was down on a linked-quarter basis, except sundryexpense where one of the factors contributing to growth was an increase inlegal reserves. Obviously the personnel line was the biggest source ofreduction as incentives were right-sized to performance. ", "We experienced good organic growth in loans where commercial growth was 6%.Organic growth in consumer was about 2%, but consumer growth was offset by saleand securitization activity which I\u2019ll describe later. Core deposits were aboutflat on a linked-quarter basis, but up 6% from a year ago. Very nice resultsconsidering the extraordinary amount of time that we dedicated in the quarterto preparation for what turned out to be a seamless conversion of theout-of-market World Savings Branches.", "As Ken mentioned, we\u2019ve clearly passed the inflection point in creditperformance. While charge-offs remained at only 19 basis points or $206 millionfor the quarter, we did see further deterioration underlying credit trends insome portfolios and ultimately our provision expense exceeded charge-offs byabout $200 million. ", "In aggregate, NPAs increased about $880 million to $3 billion or 63 basispoints of loans. ", "The tax rate of 28.8% largely simply reflects lower level of income in thequarter.", "Capital ratios are generally in line with expectations. We\u2019ve conditionedfolks to expect about a 4.6% or 4.7% tangible ratio. We ended up around 4.6%and that\u2019s a reflection of the balance sheet growing a little bit quicker andobviously income was not quite as high in the quarter as we would haveanticipated early on. We only repurchased about 4 million shares in thequarter.", "In terms of integration work, there\u2019s actually fantastic work going on withthe AG Edwards integration planning and execution. The deal closed October 1stand I\u2019ll touch on that later. ", "As I noted, the out-of-market branch conversion of World Savings Branchesoccurred this past weekend and just was a marvelous success.", "If I could ask you to turn to page 3, that details the impact of the marketdisruption on our corporate and investment bank. A couple of key points beforeI get into the detail. First, I believe we\u2019re providing a pretty complete viewof the businesses impacted by the re-pricing of risk we experience in thequarter. It might not be terribly easy for you to reconcile with peerinformation, which included perhaps a narrower list of businesses. So I thinkwe\u2019ve been pretty exhaustive in terms of describing the impact to it. ", "Second, the level of loss we experienced, it\u2019s not out of line with thescale of the businesses we\u2019re in and when we\u2019ve been asked in the past todimension our risk tolerance in CIB we\u2019ve routinely said that our risk to anextreme market disruption is one-quarter earnings for the Corporate InvestmentBank, and basically that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing here.", "Third, the losses are associated primarily with spread volatility andilliquidity. Those are essentially risks that are inherent in anoriginate-and-distribute business model and we\u2019re comfortable taking that risk.", "So, if I could ask you to look to the table tracking to the bottom of thechart, you\u2019ll see a total loss of $1.34 billion. So that\u2019s on a pre-tax basis.You go up one line, you see $40 million associated with the capitalmanagement\u2019s purchase of the Evergreen asset by the Evergreen Funds. So theremainder is in CIB. So now we\u2019ll start at the top of the CIB category.", "The first line, mark-to-market of warehouse positions and commitments in thecommercial mortgage business, along with highly rated CMDS securities andtrading portfolios, totaled $488 million. That\u2019s one where I said, I\u2019ve notreally heard a lot of peers talk to the commercial mortgage securitizationbusiness despite the fact that across the industry there are multiple billionsof dollars in warehouse and pipeline positions. So that would be one that youmight not be able to reconcile terribly easy to others.", "Next is the marks on leveraged finance assets and commitments. Here we havemarked all our positions which are scheduled to fund this year, as well asnext. We started out with an aggregate exposure of about $11 billion at thebeginning of the quarter and ended up with a similar level of total exposure.Essentially that\u2019s primary bank loans. We have a very, very modest $50 millionequity bridge, so we would conclude that we are on the less risky end of thecredit spectrum when it comes to the aggregate portfolio. ", "It\u2019s probably worth noting that as you read the chart it\u2019s probablyimportant to look at the 334 as an indicator of what the mark was net of fees.So it\u2019s something over 3%, fairly consistent with what a lot of other folkshave shown. ", "The next line addresses CDOs and CLOs and other structured products. Here wehave the marks on warehouse positions and trading inventory, both of which wehold in trading portfolios. Here the mark was $438 million. This includes thepositions Ken referred to in his reference to sub-prime mortgage exposure to AAArated securities. About $308 million is associated with AAA rated sub-primesecurities. Basically there we never would have expected that you would see AAAsecurities trade so far, so quickly, from par. ", "Finally, the consumer mortgage total of $103 million represents the mark oninventory positions in our wholesale mortgage lending business and customerwarehouse positions. So, overall, these marks account for about 80% of thequarter-over-quarter diminution and revenue, with the remainder of thedifference being primarily a slowdown in deal flow. ", "So with that, generally we pass over page 4 pretty quickly and justreconcile GAAP earnings, operating earnings, and cash earnings. Page 5, asummary of the income statement, which we\u2019ll go through in greater detail eachline item, but here I\u2019d point out that net interest up $97 million or 2% andstrong earning asset growth of $22.8 billion, and improving loans spreadsfuelled that. ", "In here there\u2019s about a $39 million benefit that\u2019s kind of a catch up from are-amortization of loan origination activity and so if you back that back outyou\u2019re up about $60 million, but I would say the drag from maintaining accessliquidity positions was something a little bit more than $10 million, soprobably up to $70 million on a core basis quarter over quarter. I think that\u2019s going to be the source of some growthgoing forward.", "Turning to page 6, if you bring your eye down to the first circle you\u2019ll seethe overhead efficiency ratio, 57.83. Clearly when we had set out on ouroverall efficiency goals we laid out what our expectations were. By the time wegot to the end of this year we\u2019ve had some acquisitions which have impactedthat in a beneficial way. So we had suggested that we could get to 51.5 to 53.5by the end of this year. That\u2019s not going to occur by the end of this year, butI think that is a pretty reasonable expectation in the relatively near future,so I think we\u2019re on pretty good track with that.", "I would just reinforce what Ken said, is that there\u2019s an awful lot of focuson expenses across the company and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the responsewe\u2019re seeing from our leaders on that front. ", "Net interest margins, down a couple basis points reflective of thesignificant liquidity positions we have during the quarter. You see charge-offsof 19 basis points, right in line with expectations. Moving your eye down alittle bit further you see the capital ratios, the 4.6 tangible ratio, where 4.7would be a target for us; the leverage ratio slightly above the target of 6. ", "If we turn now to loan deposit growth you see trading assets up $3.6 billion,reflecting growth in structured product warehouses. Securities up $3 billion,and that reflects the effect of investing excess liquidity. Commercial loansincrease 6% or $9.2 billion on the quarter. That was really across strength inlarge corporate, foreign middle market and business banking, and the commercialreal estate portfolio. Period end loans went up about $14.2 billion. ", "Consumer loans, the growth in real estate consumer loans was really maskedby the movement of $2 billion of student loans to available for sale, which weintend to sell those loans, and our credit card portfolio of about $1.6 billionwe\u2019ve moved to available for sale and we\u2019ll securitize those loans. ", "Loans held for sale up about $2.6 billion. Largely on the transfer of $2billion of student loans and $1.6 billion of credit cards I described before, aswell as other activity in the quarter. Other earning assets up $5.1 billion andthat\u2019s largely liquidity positions, interest bearing bank balances, and Fed funds.", "Finally, core deposits up just a tad on growth in retail CDs, money market andforeign, offset by some declines in DDA and savings.", "If I could ask you to turn to page 8, Fee and Other Income, and again, thereare some good stories here. Services charges, you can see, are up 3% on alinked-quarter basis, 8% from the third quarter of last year. Consumers upabout 5%. Commercial service charges relatively flat. Other banking feesheavily impacted by mortgage servicing right valuations. Underneath that,however, is good interchange activity and we are pleased with that. ", "Commissions declined $49 million, largely related to brokerage. If you thinkabout the quarter, we had had real nice activity in closed-end funds over thecourse of the last three or four quarters and essentially when the disruptionoccurred that market shut down. So despite the fact that one of the reallyattractive products had been taken out of the mix for the third quarter,brokerage still did a fantastic job and had a profit margin of about 28% forthe quarter, so very strong.", "Advisory underwriting and investment banking fees decreased 13% on weakness inhigh-grade equities and loan syndications, somewhat offset by improvement inthe structured credit products. Trading account results reflect the marks, primarily.", "Principle investing, net gains of $372 million, up about $74 million fromlast quarter results. That was somewhat offset by lower results in the publicportfolio.", "In the quarter, principal investing reflects the fact that over the past sixto nine months, had been working on an opportunity to add public funds to ourprincipal investing activities. So we sold a 25% interest in our privateportfolios and also obtained commitments to fund additional principalinvestment activity. I think it\u2019s a realtestament to the strength of that team and the confidence that institutionalinvestors have in their abilities. Security losses reflects the $40 millionmark taken on Evergreen Funds. Finally, other income decreased, again primarilyas the result of marks which we\u2019ve described.", "Expenses, a great story here. As I noted, every line is down with theexception of sundry up about $77 million and the primary increase there wouldbe increase to legal reserves. ", "Turning to the General Bank, a very solid story. Up 3% on a linked-quarterbasis. Great efficiency ratio story; down to 44.75, a nice improvement.Customer satisfaction very high, loyalty up to 53%. New loss ratio, 1.34. Wehad positive operating leverage in retail, mortgage, wholesale. ", "So again, across the board, a very good story of execution there. I\u2019m verypleased with the results. Again, that was at a time that we opened 37 De NovoBranches and consolidated 17 branches, as well as converted 214 branches fromWorld Savings; so a lot of activity and strong execution.", "Wealth management, as I mentioned, included in these results is thewrite-off of an $11 million receivable related to the insurance business, andabsent of that, you have pretty flat results with the prior quarter, althoughunderlying that, there\u2019s some very solid activity in the sales of fiduciary andasset management accounts, so a nice story there. Good control of expenses. Youcan see assets under management increased 4% on linked-quarter basis.", "The Corporate Investment Bank, obviously the bottom line results are theproduct of the marks which we\u2019ve described. You can see revenue of $819 milliondecreased $1.4 billion from the prior quarter. Net interest income is up strongand again I would expect that that would be a source of growth there for acouple of reasons: (1) there will be more assets held in portfolio; and (2)spreads are wider. So I think that\u2019s going to be a good story there. ", "Finally, after the entire industry laboring under incredibly narrow spreadswe\u2019re finally seeing a decent risk-return profile and that should be a sourceof growth, both for CIB and for the company. ", "Overall, expenses down 39%. That would be in the personnel line, as well asevery other line item in their income statement. Great control there and Ithink there\u2019s reason to believe you\u2019ll see that kind of discipline displayed goingforward. ", "Average core deposits up about 1% or 17% from last year.", "Capital Management, turning to page 13, segment earnings of $275 million. Asyou can do the math, if you add $40 million hit on the market funds after tax,add somewhere around $23 million, $24 million, and so absent that you wouldhave had again record results. There\u2019s a good story across many differentareas. Brokerage was great in terms of adding advisors, great expense control,great margin. In the money market area, I think there was flight to quality andwe saw a $6 billion increase in institutional money market accounts since June30th. That\u2019s up about 18%. ", "On the AG Edwards front, we\u2019ve completed our due diligence efforts, which isa really deep dive into all the elements of the expense and income statements.We\u2019ve selected senior leaders. We\u2019re probably about 90 days ahead of where wewould have been with the Pru integration at this point, which I think is greatfrom that standpoint. We\u2019ve revalidated all the expenses saves and revenuesynergies that we put in our model and feel good about where we\u2019re situated onAG Edwards.", "With that I will turn it over to Don before we get back to guidance.", "Donald K. Truslow", "Thanks, Tom. Looking at page 14 here, while we\u2019ve been expecting an upturnin credit costs for some time, as Ken and Tom have alluded to, the accelerateddecline in the housing market particularly as evidenced by trends over the lastmonth or so, caused credit costs toward the end of the quarter to rise somewhatfaster than we had projected. ", "I\u2019ll first give a high-level recap of the quarter. Some of the informationTom\u2019s already touched on. Then probably appropriate to dive a little deeperinto a couple of key areas.", "Non-performing assets rose $881 million to 63 basis points during thequarter. The largest component of that was a $587 million increase in consumerreal estate loans and a $127 million increase in consumer foreclosed realestate. Commercial real estate non-performing loans were up $128 million,ending the quarter at $289 million, with most of that increase representingsoftness in the residential home-building sector. Commercial and other consumernon-perform increases were pretty modest during the quarter. ", "Turning to charge-offs, losses rose to $206 million from $150 million in thesecond quarter. We ended the quarter with a 19 basis point charge-off ratio.Commercial charge-offs were up $7 million, primarily reflecting lowerrecoveries of $5 million and represented just 8 basis points. ", "Consumer charge-offs rose $49 million and were mostly driven by seasonallyhigher auto loan losses. Consumer real estate secured loan charge-offs were upa modest $18 million in the quarter and totaled just 8 basis points.", "Tom touched on provision expense totaled $408 million. That resulted in anincrease to the allowance for credit losses of a little over $200 millionbefore the transfer out of $63 million for the movement of loans transferred toheld for sale, most of that being attributed to the credit card portfolio beingmoved to held for sale. ", "The increase in the overall allowance was really driven by two things: (1) increasedloan volumes. As we\u2019ve said, there was some modest deterioration in creditquality. Also included in the allowance calculation is an $88 millioncorrection in the consumer formula-based component for overdrafts, which hadthe effect of reducing the amount of reserves needed. Additionally, there is a$75 million increase to the unassigned portion of our allowance reflecting aless certain outlook for our credit environment.", "Stepping back, it\u2019s worth making a couple of comments about some key areasin the loan accounts. Starting with the mortgage company, non-performing loanscontinue to have a low loan to value on average, and therefore we believerepresent relatively low loss content. Loan to values at the origination ofthese non-performing loans averaged 75%. Periodically we go through and weupdate those values using AVM estimated value analysis, and we did that inAugust. That\u2019s all done at the loan level. So when we ran this analysis inAugust we saw a little bit of deterioration in the loan to value numbers, butthey were still at a very conservative 77%. ", "Charge-offs from the mortgage company portfolio were a modest $21 million orabout 5.5 basis points on an annualized basis. At the end of the quarter, totalloans past due 30 days or more, including non-performs, were still relativelylow at 3.6%. ", "Much of the increase in non-performing loans and the losses, although stilllow, are on loans in certain Californiamarkets that have experienced fairly steep declines in prices. Our delinquencycall centers report that the primary reasons for borrowers struggling to payare threefold. First it\u2019s reduction of income or underemployment. Second is theassumption of additional debt from lenders other than Wachovia and therebychanging their credit profile from the origination of the loan. Third, unemployment.We have seen some uptake on unemployment in some of these markets. ", "Now, let me also point out that while the average current estimate of theappraised value of non-performing loans is 77%, there is $380 million inbalances out of the total $1.7 billion where the current estimate of value isover 90%. Actually, on that pool averages in the high 90\u2019s. Again, reflectingthe dramatic decline of house prices in certain markets. These particular loanshad a low loan to value of just under 80% at origination. It\u2019s interesting tonote here that problems in these markets, really for all lenders, seem to beacross the board without regard to originating FICO, the type of loan or thecondition of the property. ", "Given our outlook for continued weakness in the housing market and thepossibility for a slowing consumer sector, we anticipate that non-performingloans on our consumer mortgage book will continue to increase over the next fewquarters and that losses will be up, albeit at fairly modest charge-off rates. ", "To manage the increase in loans in foreclosure, we have significantlyincreased our staff responsible for handling OREO properties and working withdelinquent borrowers. When we do foreclose on a property we are moving as aggressivelyas we can to prepare and price the property to sell, and sometimes choosing tomaybe take a somewhat higher loss on that sale rather than risk holding out fora top dollar opportunity that may or may not come down the road. ", "The commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform very well overall.Loans secured with income-producing property continues to enjoy solidunderlying fundamentals with favorable vacancy rates and cash flows. As we havenoted, probably on the last couple of calls, the portion of the commercial realestate portfolio connected to housing is experiencing an upward trend incriticized assets resulting in modestly higher charge-offs and non-performs.While these loans have generally performed well overall and the charge-offs inthe total real estate financial services portfolio were only $3 million in thequarter. ", "We do anticipate further softening and have recently undertaken a thoroughreview of our residential related commercial real estate loans. Nearly all ofthese loans are on a \u2018with recourse\u2019 basis and as we identify potentialweaknesses we are and will be moving aggressively to work with borrowers toeither shore up or move those loans as best we can. As we have worked through thescrub of the portfolio, while we believe credit costs will be rising, webelieve the deterioration will be manageable. ", "Commercial middle market, business banking, as well as the credit quality inour large corporate loans continues to perform very well. It\u2019s also worthnoting that second lien residential consumer loans continues to show verystrong performance. Nearly all of our second lien loans are relationship drivenand originated through our branches. As we\u2019ve published in a couple of recentpresentations, these loans are well secured and carry high average FICO scores.The end of the quarter, 90-day past-due loans including non-performs on thissecond lien portfolio total just 45 basis points and total non-performing loanson second lien loans were just $41 million.", "As we enter the fourth quarter and head into 2008 we do see credit costsrising from the very low levels which we\u2019ve experienced for the last couple ofyears. While somewhat subjective, we have been guessing or basically estimatingthat the average through the cycle charge-off rate for our loan portfolio,given the mix of businesses, is probably somewhere in the 30 basis point range,give or take. While moving back to that rate over time is what we\u2019ve beenexpecting, the negative trends in the housing market and probable softereconomic outlook, especially as it may impact the consumer, means that we willlikely see a faster adjustment to that norm as we head into 2008 than wethought as we entered the third quarter.", "We are adjusting our annual guidance for 2007 for charge-offs to the highteens. It\u2019s noted in the outlook session in the pages that follow for thefourth quarter, we anticipate charge-offs for this quarter to be in the mid to upper-20basis point range. Also as Ken has mentioned in his opening remarks, we willcontinue to examine credit trends each quarter and add to our reserve asappropriate. ", "So Tom, in summary I would say that credit quality remains good by historicmeasures, but we are seeing more credit issues on the horizon for the industryas the housing segment of the economy continues to weaken. But given ourcollateral positions and underwriting at origination we firmly believe thatwe\u2019re relatively well positioned to ride out this environment. ", "Thomas J. Wurtz", "Thank you, Don. If I could ask people to turn to page 15, 15 is our full yearguidance in the same form that we use every other quarter and I would say thiswas put in just as a convenience to folks if your models are driven in this manner.But I think if you want to be able to understand what our view is of the fourthquarter it would be much more convenient to turn to page 16. There, we simplyprovide a reference for what third quarter actual results are and then ouroutlook for the fourth quarter in reference to the third quarter results. ", "I would make the note, this does not reflect the impact of AG Edwards, whichclosed on October 1st, which I\u2019ll address separately.", "So net interest income, $4.6 billion and we expect 1% to 3% growth relativeto that value. Income, $2.8 billion, obviously at a depressed level. We expect30% to 34% growth in the fourth quarter. Non-interest expense, $4.4 billion.Expect that growth to be in the 5% to 7% growth range. Minority interest expense,$189 million, expected to be down 20% to 30% from that level. ", "Loans, we expect overall loans to be mid single-digit growth range. Andcharge-offs, as Don mentioned, 25 to 30 basis point range. The provision, asKen mentioned and Don mentioned, would expect to be higher. This quarterprovisions exceeded charge-offs by $200 million and it isn\u2019t at all that unreasonablethat you can have something similar or even greater next quarter. We\u2019ll justhave to see what the trends suggest. If the trends had indicated that wouldhave been appropriate this quarter we would have done that. They didn\u2019t and sowe\u2019ll move forward to next quarter. We should achieve our target capital ratiosin the quarter.", "Finally, with respect to AG Edwards, on the bottom of the page we\u2019ve shownwhat their last quarter results were for revenue and expense and net income,for folks that want to incorporate that into their model, and by ourcalculations we don\u2019t believe that in the fourth quarter it has any materialimpact whatsoever. It should be about breakeven with our results. So if you getresults different than that then I would suggest you try again. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ken.", "G. Kennedy Thompson", "Well that completes our formal presentation, operator, and now we would liketo open the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of BobPatton with Morgan Keegan.", "Bob Patton \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Morning, guys.

I mean, obviously California markets, we know what\u2019s going on and you\u2019vegiven some colour, Don, but can you sort of give a little more colour what\u2019sgoing on in terms of the trends in some of the Golden West markets and theportfolio?", "G. Kennedy Thompson", "Bob, given that the kind of hot spots driving the increase in non-performare the certain California markets and the fact that Golden West was moreheavily concentrated at the time of the deal, most of the increase innon-performs does come out of the legacy Golden West portfolio. ", "But it really relates back to what is happening underlying in those marketsas opposed to anything about the product or the underwriting at inception. As amatter of fact, I think the fact that the way those loans were underwritten andhow collateral was appraised, et cetera, I think we are probably faring in muchbetter shape than other lenders in this market. ", "Donald K. Truslow", "What I can tell you, Bob, is from a top of the house perspective in terms ofnet income contribution of Golden West, net income is materially higher in 2007than it was in 2006. I would have a fair amount of optimism or a great amountof optimism that you will see or we will see growth in 2008 as well. We\u2019reseeing balanced growth, margins are wider, and to this point actual creditlosses have been extraordinarily low and we\u2019ve achieved all the expense cutsplus probably a little bit more as we integrated our mortgage businesses. I\u2019dbe honest with you, it didn\u2019t hit the numbers we thought back in 2006 or 2007,but it\u2019s clearly growing and will continue to grow at a nice healthy pace.", "Bob Patton \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Don, in terms of where we are in this housing cycle, obviously it\u2019s accelerating.Obviously we all got caught a little surprised with the rate of deteriorationand provisions across the group. Where do you think we are in terms ofpercentage? Are we halfway there? A quarter of the way there? Is this through\u201909? What\u2019s your thoughts?", "Donald K. Truslow", "Gosh, Bob, it\u2019s just hard to tell. I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re a third of theway or half way through, but it\u2019s very evident that the withdrawal of capitalthat existed for a segment of homebuyers out there, call it sub-prime or lowerquality credits disappeared and that\u2019s forcing a lot of inventory back on themarket and it\u2019s having widespread effects across the market. I don\u2019t think anyof us really connected those dots to understand that broad ripple effect. ", "Of course, there are a lot of resets that have been in the press beingtalked about coming up as we head into 2008 and what impact that has in furtherinventory coming back on the market. I think we\u2019re just going to have to watch.", "On the positive side -- and this is kind of good and bad -- but the housingstart numbers the other day were low and as you would hope, so maybe that\u2019s asignal that new inventory from construction is slowing down and hopefully willhelp us work through the inventory overhang out there maybe a little morequickly. Personally I think we\u2019re looking at a very soft housing environmentwell into 2008, if not all the way through 2008.", "G. Kennedy Thompson", "I would just say, Bob, a couple of the areas where again that would be positivewould be the reset issue that Don described isn\u2019t an issue for us. Our productsdon\u2019t have that feature. Second, just amplifying what Don said about the secondportfolio, it\u2019s performing extraordinarily well with only about $40 million inNPAs. So we\u2019re insulated from that standpoint and that\u2019s certainly a source ofcomfort.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBCCapital Markets.", "Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "A question about the net charge-off ratio that Don touched on regarding afull cycle of being about 30 basis points. Would you expect to exceed that inthe down part of the cycle since you had great numbers in the last couple ofyears in the teens? So to get to that average do we need to exceed that 30basis points at some point in the future? ", "Donald K. Truslow", "I mean, that would be an average through a cycle and so we\u2019ve kind of beentracking an interesting trend going back to the third quarter of 2001, the lastcycle, and pulling through our average charge-off ratios including losses onloans that we\u2019ve sold into market or took advantage of the cash markets. ", "If you average through those years up until maybe last quarter or thequarter before, wherever you want to pick, maybe the beginning of theinflection point, we\u2019re in the low 30\u2019s. Again, it\u2019s subjective because marketschange, every cycle is different. It\u2019s really just an educated estimate. ", "But when I talk about 30 basis points give or take it really is through acycle. So at some point in the downturn you\u2019re in worse position and obviouslyat other points you\u2019re in a better position.", "Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "The other question, can you guys give us some further color on the commentyou made about the $40 million valuation loss related to the certain asset-backedcommercial paper investments at Evergreen?", "Donald K. Truslow", "Sure, I\u2019d be happy to, Gerard. Really, when the market was at its ultimatedisruption everyone was concerned by commercial papers that was supported byassets and asset-backed commercial paper vehicles. We looked through theportfolio and we saw about $1 billion of commercial paper that was backed bywhat we considered to be pretty high quality underlying collateral and we feltthat it would reassure customers of the Evergreen Funds to buy them out. ", "Essentially all the underlying positions were AAA collateral. So we boughtthem out and as we sit here today probably about half of it has been resolvedor paid back and there\u2019s some more coming down the line where the ultimate losswill be zero. So we\u2019ll probably take a hit in the neighborhood of $4 million,$5 million, $6 million perhaps if we were to sell the assets and if we were tohold onto them, perhaps nothing. But we just thought it was the right thing todo and I think our customers saw that as a real sign of strength. As Imentioned, we saw great inflows during the quarter.", "Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Finally, somebody mentioned about you guys have seen some softness inunemployment or unemployment rates rising in some of your markets. Can you tellus or identify which markets you\u2019re seeing that happen?", "Donald K. Truslow", "I was mentioning that, and if you go out to pull the data from moodyseconomy.comand just track some of the markets in Californiaand the central valley and, again, some of the places you have been reading aboutwhere there\u2019ve been housing declines, you also see a slight corresponding uptickin unemployment. So that\u2019s where we pulled that data.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Gary Townsend with FBR CapitalMarkets.", "Gary Townsend \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Ken, could you talk about risk management experience in the past quarter inyour capital markets operations, please? Were you satisfied? What might you dobetter? What types of assessments are being made?", "G. Kennedy Thompson", "I would say to you that starting in that second or third week in July whenthe markets seized up we have been very hands on and very active in meetingwith CIB leaders, with risk, with finance, and me on a regular basis. As Ithink Tom said, we think our disclosure to you on our marks is extremelytransparent. That $1.3 billion in marks is essentially all of the marks we tookand we think that a lot of other companies as they have presented their markshave only shown you certain areas. So we think that the $1.3 billion that youmight compare us with others is maybe overstated a little bit. ", "But if you look back at the marks that we took, 90% of those marks are in whatwe consider to be very core businesses for us. That would be leverage finance,commercial real estate finance, and structured products. Those are businessesthat fit our business model well. We\u2019ve got traditional strength in those fixedincome markets and those are businesses that we want to be in. ", "I would say to you that I\u2019m comfortable that our capital markets leadersunderstand our business model, that they sized our risk limits and stress teststo the desired earnings and historical financial performance goals. I think our business unit at all timesoperated within approved limits. We didn\u2019t see any situations where we gotoutside of limits or outside of our model. ", "I think without question we\u2019re going to use the experience that we\u2019ve just beenthrough to refine our models. We\u2019re certainly going to worsen some of thestress testing conditions that we look at going forward and we\u2019ll change theway we do some things. ", "I would say that as we look at results I think the biggest disappointmentfor me is that of those $1.3 billion in marks we had about $300 million,roughly $300 million in losses on AAA sub-prime paper that was in trading deskor in inventory. The thing that disappoints me about that is we have aninstitutional bias here against sub-prime. We avoided it in our originationefforts and we avoided it for the most part in our securitization efforts. ", "So frankly, I think we had a little bit of a breakdown in having AAAsub-prime in some of our portfolios that we took losses on. I do think that itis really quite amazing that we can take $300 million of losses on AAA paper. Imean, we didn\u2019t expect that that paper could degenerate that fast with thatkind of swiftness. ", "So overall I would say to you that I think we did a good job in our riskmanagement here. We have always been in this business knowing that losses couldtake place. Some of it is liquidity and may come back. But we\u2019ve always had a minimumtarget that said we could lose one quarter\u2019s worth of earnings in our marketsbusiness and that\u2019s essentially what happened here and I think we\u2019re poised togrow those businesses going forward. ", "Does that get at your question?", "Gary Townsend \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Quite thoroughly. Thank you. Don, could you talk about auto credit andtrends there? This has obviously poked its head up now too.", "Donald K. Truslow", "For the quarter the uptick is primarily seasonally driven. If you go backand look at our portfolio, the track by quarter of charge-off rates, typicallythe first and the second quarter, particularly the second quarter, is a lowpoint. But as the manufacturers begin to change over their model years there isan impact as we go to market with repossessions in the third quarter and thefourth quarter given that there are new car models coming on the market. Soseverities tend to rise. ", "The charge-ff rates in the auto portfolio have been pretty much tracking to theseasonal pattern we\u2019ve seen in the past. So while charge-offs are up, the otherthing that maybe is not as transparent that you\u2019ve got to keep in mind is thatit\u2019s a very profitable business and the margins that we\u2019re getting on the paperwe feel like we\u2019re being very well compensated for the risk. ", "Actually, on the Westportportfolio we are tracking well below the charge-off forecast that weanticipated at the time of the deal. So we\u2019re very pleased about that.", "Gary Townsend \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "So the weaker trend in auto you\u2019d describe as more seasonal?", "Donald K. Truslow", "That was primarily what we saw in our portfolio. I guess a key questiongoing forward for all of us looking at 2008 is if the housing disruption beginsto impact the consumer in a bigger way, does that then ripple back into theauto market in some form or fashion more than we\u2019re seeing?", "Gary Townsend \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "As we talk to companies, September, and I think you mentioned this too, wasa particularly weak month for credit. Is that trend, as you see it in October,about the same? Would you say it\u2019s slowed or accelerated? ", "Donald K. Truslow", "Still kind of early in the month, but I would say that the trends we sawlate August and September, half way through this month are about the same. Iwouldn\u2019t say that they\u2019ve accelerated, but they haven\u2019t backed off either.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matthew O\u2019Connor, UBS.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 UBS", "Can you tell us how much reserves were set aside for your first lienresidential mortgages? ", "Donald K. Truslow", "I don\u2019t have the number right off the top of my head specifically, but I willtell you that the ticker tape portfolio was the largest component of the firstlien portfolio and we have multiples of what the losses have been and theexpected losses built into our model have been somewhere around 9 basis points.We are looking at that now. Of course, charge-offs on that portfolio have beenless and the overall reserve for the portfolio has been somewhere around 20, 22basis points. But we will be taking a look at that in the fourth quarter aswell as we freshen up the expected loss evident to 2008.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 UBS", "Assuming that goes higher, like under a stress scenario, if you get back tothat 18 basis points that you had last time, what would that do to reserves? Isit kind of a one-to-one, two-to-one? Can you give us a sense of the ratiothere?", "Donald K. Truslow", "Hard to know, just because of the couple of components that really drive thereserve. There`s an expected loss component that certainly would go up. There`sa variability component that may not change as much. So I don`t know that youcould ascribe a one-to-one move in the reserve to charge-off trends. As ageneral comment, the likelihood is we would be providing more than we are todayas we saw a credit worsen. Most likely a further charge-off amount.", "G. Kennedy Thompson", "I think it`s worth noting there that as provisions rise, what we`re alsoseeing is outstandings growing and we`ve got better margins in that businessnow. So to a certain extent we are seeing net interest income growth really wethink is going to do a very good job of paying us for the credit losses that wewill take as provisions go up.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 UBS", "That`s definitely a fair point. As we think about fourth quarter reservebuild, is it likely to be more than we had this quarter? On a reserve to loanbasis, for example, because of the good loan growth the ratio actually wentdown a little. If you`re going to revise up to the loss estimate should weexpect a pretty meaningful build in reserves in 4Q?", "Donald K. Truslow", "Matt, it\u2019s just too early to say. The reserve process basically consists ofus looking at the portfolios that will come in at the end of the quarter and,as I mentioned, both look at loan volumes as well as credit quality, with someadjustment for trends that we may sense that aren\u2019t captured in our normalother factors. So that\u2019s, for instance, why we felt it appropriate to build ourunassigned reserve somewhat this quarter and we\u2019ll just have to watch that aswe move into the quarter. I don\u2019t know that I could give you a very clear senseof what might happen in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our allotted time forquestions and answers, and your final question will come from the line of KeithHorowitz with Citigroup.", "Keith Horowitz \u2013 Citigroup", "In your 10-Q you disclosed that you had roughly I think $7 billion SIV goingthrough your QER.It looks like you moved, you consolidated that $1.8 billion.First of all, is that correct? And if so, what happened to the remainder of theSIV? For example, were you able to sell some of those assets?", "Thomas J. Wurtz", "I\u2019m going to answer your question and then also have one other note to make.I was looking through my notes as to things I wanted to mention on our marksand I noted that our marks were net of hedges, but it\u2019s probably worthwhilenoting also that given that we\u2019re not in fair value accounting there is nomark-to-market on our own debt softening those marks in that business.", "In terms of the SIV exposure, we had a $7 billion exposure and basically $3billion of that amount appears as foreign loans and that is in Wachovia BankInternational. About $2 billion is in loans held for sale. Less than $2 billionis in trading. It was a little less than $1 billion that was really a cashposition in that account, so that came as cash. That\u2019s kind of a reconciliationof where we were and where we are.", "Keith Horowitz \u2013 Citigroup", "It all collapsed back on balance sheet.", "Thomas J. Wurtz", "Correct.", "G. Kennedy Thompson", "You get that Keith? It\u2019s all on balance sheet.", "Keith Horowitz \u2013 Citigroup", "Yeah, no, I got that. That\u2019s the perfect answer. Thank you.", "Operator", "Are there any closing remarks?", "G. Kennedy Thompson", "I would just say thank you for your interest in Wachovia today. I hope thatwe\u2019ve done a good job of answering the questions that you\u2019ve got. Obviously, asalways, Alice Lehman and her team will be available to take further questions. ", "Just in closing, it\u2019s obviously been a tough environment. We\u2019re not excitedto report down earnings, but we are pretty optimistic about our model and aboutour ability to go forward and to do well at Wachovia. So thanks for being withus.

Thank you for calling in to the Wells Fargo fourth quarter 2007 earnings review pre-recorded call.", "Before we talk about our fourth quarter and full year results, we need to make the standard securities law disclosure.", "In this call we will make forward-looking statements about specific income statement and balance sheet items and other measures of future results of operations and financial conditions such as statements about credit quality and future credit losses generally, specifically that we believe the allowance for credit losses is adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2007, and we expect credit losses to be higher in 2008 than they were in 2007.", "Forward-looking statements give our expectations about the future. They are not guarantees and results may differ from expectations.", "Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date.", "For a discussion of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to our SEC filings - including the 8-K filed today, which includes a press release announcing our fourth quarter results - and to our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and to the information incorporated into those documents.", "Now, I will turn the review over to our Chief Financial Officer, Howard Atkins.", "Howard Atkins", "Thanks, Bob.", "Despite the economic, housing and capital markets challenges in 2007, Wells Fargo's businesses performed well overall and relative to our industry peers. By focusing on the core fundamentals of our time-tested business model, we acquired new customers, solidified relationships through cross-sell, filled in our franchise with valuable acquisitions, grew revenues at double-digit rates once again and at a faster rate than expenses, and maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions. As a result, we generated double-digit growth in revenue, loans, deposits, and fee income for the year.", "Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.41 included a previously announced credit reserve build that cost $0.27 per share, largely for expected future losses in our home equity portfolio originated in certain indirect channels through which we are no longer accepting business.", "To date, the financial services industry has announced over $100 billion in credit reserve builds in asset write-downs. While we were not immune to the adverse economic environment, we largely avoided many of the problems and costly write-downs that other large financial institutions incurred.", "The $1.4 billion credit provision in excess of charge-offs we took in the fourth quarter to build reserves represents less than 2% after tax of our common equity, significantly less as a percent of capital than almost all the financial institutions which have announced credit-related write-downs or reserve builds.", "We had double-digit revenue growth of 10.4% for the full year, and revenue rose to a record $10.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% year-over-year on 20% loan growth, 11% core deposit growth, and 8% fee growth.", "Since we grew revenue more than expenses for the year, we once again had positive operating leverage, reflecting this strong revenue growth combined with disciplined expense management.", "Our pre-tax, pre-provision profit - that is, our total revenue less non-interest expense   grew to an annual record of $16.6 billion for the year, up 12% from 2006, and grew to a quarterly record of $4.3 billion, up 8% from fourth quarter 2006 and 12% annualized linked quarter.", "I want to start with our typical review of how our diversified businesses performed, and how broad based our growth drivers continue to be in both our commercial and consumer businesses. I will then review our credit quality across our various loan portfolios.", "Let me start with our commercial businesses.", "Our Wholesale and Commercial Banking Group, which serves primarily middle-market customers and select niches in the large corporate market, had a strong quarter and year, with double-digit net income and revenue growth. These results reflect our ongoing focus on developing long-term relationships while avoiding riskier, one-off transactions.", "Net income grew 20% from the fourth quarter of 2006, and revenue grew 14%, reflecting strong growth in commercial loans and business deposits and fee based business such as asset management, insurance and international.", "Our Wholesale Banking Group achieved record earnings in each of the past nine years, including 2007. Cross-sell was 6.1 products per Wholesale relationship and 7.6 products per middle-market relationship; 31% of middle-market offices, located in 30 states coast to coast, have over eight products per customer.", "Wholesale Banking Group's average loans grew 27% year-over-year as a result of new customers and opportunistic loan portfolio acquisitions. Asset-based lending, middle-market lending, commercial real estate and specialized financial services, which include our capital markets activities and relationships with Fortune 500 companies, all experienced double-digit loan growth.", "Throughout the market disruption, we have been very clear that we are open for business, and we have been actively meeting the financing needs of our commercial customers. However, we remain focused on making quality loans and on maintaining the continued low level of loan losses in our Wholesale Group which I will describe in a moment. This reflects the benefit of the long-standing relationship orientation and conservative underwriting in this business.", "Wholesale Banking Group's average core deposits were up $18 billion or 40% from the fourth quarter of 2006. The growth came primarily from large corporate and middle-market relationships, international and correspondent banking customers, and from higher institutional sweep and liquidity balances from our asset management customers.", "The International Group had double-digit revenue and earnings growth for the quarter and for the year.", "Due to volatility in the currency and credit markets, the Foreign Exchange Group traded a record $16 billion per day in transactions during the quarter, and quarterly volumes were up 51% from a year ago. We have foreign exchange sales and trading desks in San Francisco, New York, Minneapolis, and sales offices in 11 other markets. We also serve our customers through Foreign Exchange Online, the online foreign exchange platform on our industry leading commercial electronic office portal.", "More than 70% of our commercial banking relationships are active users of our online business portal. Foreign Exchange Online grew revenue 24% in the fourth quarter.", "We serve our retail and small business customers through approximately 325 international teller locations in our banking stores, with 40% revenue growth in the fourth quarter.", "Despite a weak dollar, Wells Fargo customers continued to travel overseas, with bank note revenue up 25% in 2007.", "Wells Fargo Insurance, Inc., our Consumer and Small Business Insurance Group, had double-digit revenue, up 32%, and double-digit earnings, up 45%, in the fourth quarter. Strong revenue growth was driven by homeowner's insurance, debt cancellation and crop insurance.", "Cross-sell was also a major growth driver, with store and phone banker referrals to our insurance agents exceeding $1 million 2007, up 50% from 2006.", "Wells Fargo Insurance Services, Inc., our middle-market commercial insurance broker, also continued to grow revenue and acquired insurance agencies in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Texas and California in the fourth quarter. A total of 16 insurance agency acquisitions were completed in 2007.", "We continued to make it more convenient for our wholesale customers to do more business with Wells Fargo. Through our electronic deposit services, including the Internet-based Desktop Deposit Service, on several occasions we captured and cleared over 1 million check images and more than $2 billion in deposits in a single day.", "In 2007, over 102 million checks were cleared electronically, over three times the total in 2006 and over $232 billion in deposit dollars were received electronically, more than double the amount in 2006.", "Our electronic deposit services, including Desktop Deposit, now account for approximately 12% of our treasury management customers' checking deposit volume. Desktop Deposit is an important product for us because it adds convenience and flexibility for our customers, reduces our check processing expenses, and provides a good source of fee income for our treasury management business.", "The Asset Management Group, which is responsible for managing and administering a total of $644 billion in client assets, had double-digit growth in revenue earnings and assets under management.", "Assets under management were up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2006.", "Wells Fargo Advantage Funds, our mutual fund business, grew average assets by 24% from a year ago, and ended the year with $155 billion in fund balances, making it the third-largest fund manager among U.S. banks. This growth was driven by strong fund performance and new balances. Over half of the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds were in the top two Lipper performance quintiles for the past three-year period. Wells Fargo Advantage Funds won 10 Mutual Fund Education Alliance awards, winning over 30% of the total awards - more than any competitor in our category, including Vanguard, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and American Century.", "Our capital markets business was largely not impacted by the credit crunch or market dislocations during the quarter, including industry problem areas of collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and structured investment vehicles.", "On the investment side of this business, we operate within Wells Fargo's disciplined credit standards and regularly monitor and manage our securities portfolios to provide liquidity for the company and to build long-term portfolio yield.", "From a lending standpoint, we have not participated in a significant way in any of the large leveraged buyouts that were covenant light, and we have minimal direct exposure to hedge funds. Similarly, we have not made a market in subprime securities.", "Let me shift now to our Community Banking Group. Our Community Banking Group, which includes regional banking, wealth management, home equity, mortgage banking and retail Internet, had solid revenue growth, up 9% in the fourth quarter and up 11% in 2007.", "Bottom-line results as reported for this business included the credit reserve build of $1.4 billion pre-tax.", "Regional banking, serving 11 million households, continued to focus on helping customers achieve their financial goals, with record core product sales of $19.7 million in 2007, up 11% from 2006 on a comparable basis and $4.7 million in core product sales in the fourth quarter, up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2006 on a comparable basis.", "California continued to be one of our fastest-growing states, with a 16% increase in core product sales from the fourth quarter of 2006 on a comparable basis. These strong sales results largely reflected greater productivity, with core sales per platform banker FTE of 4.93 per day in 2007, up from 4.75 per day in 2006.", "With over 16,000 platform banker FTE across our 23 banking states, small increases in sales productivity results in meaningful increases in core product sales. The average retail bank household now has 5.5 products with Wells Fargo, up from 5.2 products a year ago and up from around three products in 1998.", "Six of our 32 regions now have an average retail bank household cross-sell of over six; 22% of our retail customers had over eight products with us, our long-term goal, nearly double the amount of customers who bought eight products five years ago. And in our top region, 31% of our customers had over eight products with us.", "Sales of Wells Fargo Packages, which include a checking account and at least three other products such as a debit card, a credit card, a savings account or home equity loan, we up 22% from the fourth quarter of 2006, purchased by 70% of new checking account customers.", "Increased customer penetration and usage of credit and debit cards grew total card fee income by 22% from fourth quarter 2006 and 19% annualized on a linked-quarter basis.", "At quarter end, 37% of our retail bank consumer households had a Wells Fargo credit card, up from 35% a year ago and up from 24% five years ago. Purchase volume on these cards was up 19% from fourth quarter 2006, and average balances were up 28%.", "91% of our consumer checking account customers had a debit card, up from 85% five years ago, and purchase volume increased by 14% in the fourth quarter from a year ago.", "Wells Fargo's best in class Rewards suite for our credit and debit card customers has contributed to both our growth in balances and purchase volume. In addition, customers are finding our patent-pending MySpendingReport a helpful tool for understanding and managing their spending.", "Average core deposits of $315 billion, including $3.6 billion of deposits from Greater Bay Bancorp - an acquisition completed in the fourth quarter - grew 11% from a year ago and 11% annualized on a linked-quarter basis.", "Average mortgage escrow deposits were down $392 million from the fourth quarter of 2006 and down $3 billion from the third quarter of 2007 due to slower mortgage repayments and the timing of tax payments.", "Excluding mortgage escrow balances, total average core deposits grew 12% from the fourth quarter of 2006 and 16% annualized on a linked-quarter basis.", "Average retail core deposits, which exclude wholesale banking and mortgage escrow deposits, were up 6% from a year ago and 10% annualized on a linked-quarter basis. The average balance per retail account continued to decline slightly, reflecting the increase in debt service and energy costs faced by many consumers.", "Deposit mix continued to shift in favor of higher-yielding savings and CDs relative to lower-cost savings and demand deposit accounts.", "Unlike many of our competitors, we lowered our deposit rates in the fourth quarter in connection with the Fed Funds rate cuts while continuing to grow both deposits and net new accounts, positioning us well for the future.", "Consumer checking accounts were up a net 4.7% from last year, and small business checking accounts were up a net 3.6% from last year.", "California continued to be our fastest-growing market, with new consumer checking accounts up a net 5.7%. This is the tenth consecutive quarter where net new accounts in California exceeded the average across our footprint.", "We have also had good growth in deposit fees, which were up 13% from the fourth quarter of 2006.", "We continue to better meet the financial needs of our small business customers. 2007 sales of store-based business solutions were up 16% from 2006 on a comparable basis, and fourth quarter sales were up 13% from fourth quarter 2006 on a comparable basis.", "Sales of Wells Fargo Business Services Packages, which include a business checking account and at least three other business products, such as a business debit card, a business credit card, a business savings account, or business loan or a line of credit, were up 33% and purchased by 44% of new business checking account customers in the fourth quarter.", "These strong sales results increased our cross-sell to our business banking households to 3.5, up from 3.3 a year ago. Bank loans to small businesses, loans primarily less than $100,000 on our business direct platform, grew 18% from the fourth quarter of 2006.", "We continued to focus on delivering a great experience for our customers and measuring our progress through 50,000 store-based customer surveys per month, over 2 million surveys since we began surveying four years ago.", "For customers transacting at the teller line, welcoming and wait time scores improved 11% and customer loyalty scores have improved 7% from 2006. One reason for this improvement is the increase in team member engagement. The more engaged our team members are, the better they serve our customers. In 2007, our team member engagement ratio increased to 8.5 to 1, up from 7.1 to 1 in 2006, more than four times the U.S. average of 2 to 1 and up from 2.5 to 1 five years ago. This continued to place Wells Fargo in the top quartile of all companies in the Gallup team member engagement database.", "Our Wealth Management Group had another outstanding quarter, with revenue up 14% from a year ago. These results were driven by double-digit fee, deposit and loan growth. We are also attracting new customers and better penetrating our existing customer base with our expanding product line.", "Strong customer trading activity and the introduction of the Wells Fargo Cash Sweep, an FDIC deposit sweep for brokerage accounts, drove our retail brokerage business to achieve 22% revenue growth and 17% net income growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to fourth quarter of 2006.", "Brokerage assets under administration reached $103 billion, increasing 10% from a year ago.", "Wells Trade, our online brokerage service, introduced new pricing during the first quarter of 2007, offering 100 commission-free online trades per year to Wells Fargo PMA customers. This relationship-based pricing offer has increased new account openings by 42%, our self-directed assets under administration by 34%, and Wells Trade revenue by 26% from the fourth quarter of 2006.", "Wells Fargo Wealth Management was recently named among the top 10 wealth managers in the United States by Barron's. Recognition and a flight to quality by customers during these challenging economic times continued to generate customer growth for us.", "Wells Fargo continues to be a leader in retail online banking. At year end, we had 9.7 million active online consumers, up 13% from a year ago; 65% of all Wells Fargo consumer checking account customers are now active online customers.", "We had 980,000 active online small business customers, up 18% from a year ago.", "Internet sales continue to be an important channel for overall sales growth, with consumer product sales up 29% from the fourth quarter of 2006.", "Wells Fargo launched another component of its Wells Fargo Mobile service, text banking. This addition makes Wells Fargo the first major financial services company in the country to offer its consumer and small business customers both browser and text-based account access through their mobile devices.", "Let me now shift to mortgage banking. In a year in which many mortgage companies folded and most large originators incurred substantial losses, our mortgage business continued to grow and gain market share as we remained open for business for our existing and new customers.", "Our owned servicing portfolio grew 12%, ending the year at a record $1.53 trillion. This serving portfolio growth significantly contributed to the 36% growth in our mortgage banking non-interest income for the year, 23% fourth quarter year-over-year growth.", "The 73% fourth quarter year-over-year increase in net servicing fee income more than offset the 28% decline in net gains on mortgage loan origination and sales activities, once again demonstrating the value of our balanced mortgage business model.", "Fourth quarter net servicing fee income included a net MSR gain of $280 million, consisting of a $1.9 billion reduction in the market value of MSRs due in part to the impact of more than a 40 basis point decline in 30-year mortgage rates offset by a $2.2 billion gain on the economic hedge of the MSR.", "At December 31, the ratio of capitalized MSRs to the total amount of mortgages serviced for others was 1.2%, the lowest ratio in 10 quarters and a 15 basis point decline from the third quarter of 2007.", "Net gains on mortgage loan origination and sales activities in the fourth quarter were adversely impacted by continuing illiquidity in the secondary mortgage markets for primarily ARM and nonconforming fixed-rate products. As a result, mortgage origination gains include $119 million of write-down during the fourth quarter to reflect the fair value of the mortgage warehouse and pipeline, which is comprised predominantly of prime mortgages.", "During the quarter, nearly $15 billion of our warehouse loans were securitized, and about half retained as securities in our available for sale investment portfolio at very attractive yields. None of these new securities are collateralized by subprime loans.", "In addition to the warehouse markdown, mortgage origination gains were reduced by $91 million, primarily to reflect a write-down of repurchased mortgage loans, and an increase in the repurchase reserve.", "Net gain on mortgage loan origination sale activities also included a $58 million reduction in share value of servicing associated with mortgage loans held for sale.", "During the last half of 2007, we continued to reduce our mortgage banking risk and improve profitability. These efforts, combined with the general decline in mortgage demand, caused our originations during the fourth quarter to decline to $56 billion, down $12 billion or 17% from the third quarter and down $14 billion or 20% from the fourth quarter of 2006. Much of this decline is attributable to actions we took, such as heightening credit standards and eliminating certain distribution channels and loan products. Most of the origination decline occurred in the correspondent and wholesale mortgage channels and in home equity originations.", "We remained one of the nation's leading retail mortgage originators, with Wells Fargo home mortgage quarterly retail originations totalling $28 billion, down only $1 billion linked-quarter and year-over-year.", "Our applications continue to be strong. At $91 billion, mortgage applications in the fourth quarter were seasonally down $4 billion on a linked-quarter basis or actually up $1 billion from the fourth quarter of 2006.", "The unclosed pipeline of mortgage applications stood at a relatively high $43 billion at 12/31/07, down only 10% from a year ago.", "Let me now shift to credit quality. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter increased to $1.2 billion or 1.28% of loans annualized, up from $892 million in the third quarter. Almost half of the increase was concentrated in our consumer real estate portfolios, largely in home equity products and channels we have now discontinued.", "In the commercial portfolios, the increase in charge-offs were primarily from loans originated through our business direct channel, while loss levels in our commercial loans to mid-size and large corporations continued to remain exceptionally low.", "Total non-performing assets were $3.87 billion or 1.01% of loans in the fourth quarter compared with $3.18 billion or 0.88% of loans in the third quarter. The majority of the increase in non-performing assets was concentrated in the first mortgage portfolios, consistent with the rise in foreclosure rates in many markets.", "Due to market conditions, it has taken longer to workout foreclosed properties than would typically be the case at stronger stages of the housing cycle.", "Our non performing loan portfolio continued to have relatively low loss potential based on the high percentage of consumer real estate and auto secured loans, where we take an initial write-down to estimated net realizable value as the loan is transferred to non-performing status.", "Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, excluding insured and guaranteed GNMA balances, increased by $296 million from the third quarter. This increase was concentrated in our consumer real estate and unsecured portfolios and was consistent with the increases in non-performing and net charge-offs previously mentioned.", "Let me review the individual loan portfolios in detail, and I'll start by focusing on our exposure to the residential real estate market.", "Our first mortgage portfolio continued to perform well in the fourth quarter, with annualized charge-offs of only 0.19%. In other words, only $32 million in fourth quarter losses on the entire $71 billion first mortgage portfolio. The $71 billion of first mortgages that were on our balance sheet at 12/31/2007 consisted primarily of $23 billion of debt consolidation loans at Wells Fargo Financial, $12 billion of home equity loans in the first mortgage position, and $36 billion of mostly prime customers, relationship-based first mortgages held at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, regional banking, and our Wealth Management Group.", "While our disciplined underwriting standards have resulted in first mortgage delinquencies considerably below industry levels, we continued to tighten our underwriting standards in the fourth quarter, including adjusting maximum LTVs based on local market conditions.", "At year end, Wells Fargo Financial had $24 billion in U.S.-based real estate secured debt consolidation loans. These loans are for debt consolidation purposes, not for the purchase of a home. 96% of this portfolio was in the first lien position. Wells Fargo Financial has not originated any interest-only, stated income, option ARMs, or negative amortizing residential real estate loans. All U.S.-based debt consolidation loans are originated by Wells Fargo Financial team members. We do not use any brokers or correspondents in this business.", "Wells Fargo Financial does not do any national advertising campaigns. New real estate customers primarily come from outbound calling to customers with an existing Wells Fargo relationship and where we can clearly demonstrate a tangible benefit for our customers by improving their financial situations through debt consolidation.", "We conservatively underwrite these loans with full documentation, and we require income verification. 63% of the portfolio had a FICO score above 620. The average LTV was 79%. The average loan size was $130,000. Approximately 49% of the portfolio was fixed-rate loans. The remaining were 3/27 adjustable rate mortgages, with a fixed payment for the first three years of the loan. These loans do not contain initial rate adjusters on reset and were underwritten to the fully indexed rate.", "This prudent product strategy, combined with cautious underwriting has resulted in better credit performance than published industry rates for non-prime mortgage portfolios.", "While delinquency and charge-offs have increased in this portfolio due to the weak housing market, annualized net charge-offs in the fourth quarter were 31 basis points, with total fourth quarter losses of only $18 million on the entire $24 billion portfolio.", "Our National Home Equity Group manages a portfolio of $84 billion in home equity loans. As we disclosed in November, we have identified $12 billion of higher-loss content home equity loans, primarily sourced through third-party originators, which were segregated into a liquidating portfolio under a dedicated management team.", "The December annualized loss rate in the liquidating portfolio was 4.80%. This portfolio accounted for about half the total increase in home equity charge-offs in the fourth quarter. The liquidating portfolio was primarily sourced through third parties, where 55% had an updated combined loan-to-value of greater than 90%.", "The remaining home equity portfolio of $72 billion had a December annualized loss rate of 0.86%; 16% of this portfolio was in the first position, and 63% in the second lien position were behind a Wells Fargo first mortgage. 98% were retail originated, which have performed better than loans originated through third-party channels; 25% had an updated combined loan-to-value greater than 90%.", "While home equity financing continues to be an important relationship product that helps our customers manage their finances, we have exited most of our indirect wholesale and correspondent channels and tightened underwriting standards throughout our retail channels due to higher losses.", "As we previously announced, Wells Fargo is no longer acquiring home equity loans through correspondent relationships and will no longer originate home equity loans through wholesalers unless the second mortgage is behind a Wells Fargo first mortgage and the combined loan-to-value ratio of the first and second mortgage is less than 90%.", "In our continuing channels, we have developed MSA-based combined loan to value maximums based on market conditions which are reviewed monthly. For example, in severely distressed markets, the maximum combined loan-to-value is 75%.", "We have eliminated borrower-selected reduced income documentation home equity loans. We have also reorganized the home equity business within our community banking segment to enhance the execution of our relationship-based strategy.", "While we do not retain credit risk on the majority of our residential mortgage servicing portfolio, which services over 10 million mortgages, we closely monitor the credit performance of the portfolio. Over 90% of the mortgage loans we service are for prime customers. The vast majority of the subprime loans we service are held by investors, and the subprime loans originated by Wells Fargo Home Mortgage have historically had foreclosures that are half that of loans not originated by our company.", "This outperformance is primarily a result of our long-standing responsible lending practices, which include focusing on the customer's ability to repay, providing the customer with the information needed to make fully informed decisions, and making only those loans that provide demonstrable benefit to the customer.", "Delinquencies and foreclosures continued to increase as the housing market remained weak, however only 0.88% of our servicing portfolio - less than 1%   was in foreclosure. Throughout 2007, our foreclosure rate was more than 20% better than the industry average.", "We work hard at keeping people in their homes. For example, Wells Fargo worked closely with the U.S. Treasury Department, federal banking regulators, the HOPE NOW Alliance, and the American Securitization Forum to help launch Fast-Track for subprime ARM loan modifications and refinances. We will launch the Fast-Track program this month, and we continue to work to find additional ways to further assist our customers with delinquencies.", "While loan modifications and foreclosures increase our servicing costs, many of these costs are reimbursed by investors, and we continue to have efficiency gains in other areas.", "We continue to proactively staff our call centers in order to provide high-quality assistance for our customers.", "Credit losses in our $27 billion auto portfolio at Wells Fargo Financial increased due primarily to expected seasonality in the second half of the year, including fourth quarter. Net auto charge-offs increased $21 million from the prior quarter and were up $10 million from the fourth quarter of 2006.", "Delinquencies and 90 days past due and still accruing were up on a linked-quarter basis, but 90 days past due were down 19% from the fourth quarter 2006 peak.", "Over 70% of the auto portfolio had FICO scores above 620. The size of our auto portfolio was essentially unchanged from last quarter and last year, reflecting tightening of account acquisition strategies to reduce loan volume in higher-risk tiers.", "Two other retail portfolios that are important to our credit performance are credit card and business direct. The $11 billion community banking credit card portfolio was primarily issued to our banking customers within our banking states. Our relationship focus helps us to control loss rates, but losses are increasing from historical low levels as a result of higher bankruptcy rates and seasoning of the portfolio.", "In response, we proactively manage these accounts by maintaining good collection capacity and modifying existing accounts, including reducing lines and closing accounts where appropriate.", "Wells Fargo Financial has a $7.7 billion credit card portfolio. These cards are primarily sold to existing Wells Fargo Financial customers and through retail stores and manufacturers with large dealer networks, not through mass mailing campaigns.", "Losses in this portfolio have increased, however we have made significant investments in default management and continue to tighten underwriting standards, a process that first started in the middle of 2006.", "Our $11.6 billion business direct portfolio consists primarily of unsecured small loans and lines of credit to small business owners nationwide, with an average balance of less than $20,000. These loans are included in our commercial loan totals, but tend to perform in a manner similar to credit cards and unsecured consumer loans. Similar to our credit card portfolios, we continue to tighten our underwriting standards, including reducing line limits where appropriate.", "Our remaining commercial and commercial real estate portfolios continue to produce good credit performance and healthy loan growth. This segment of our lending business benefits from our focus on deep and long-term relationships with middle market commercial, commercial real estate and small business customers as well as from diversifying the portfolio geographically and by product type.", "At year end 2007, we had approximately $6 billion in residential one to four-family construction and land development loans, which is only about 1.5% of total loans. While losses in this portfolio are increasing due to the decline in the residential real estate market, losses remained acceptable because we maintained our credit discipline during the boom times of the real estate market.", "Our commercial real estate management team has been together for over 20 years, and they have successfully managed our commercial real estate portfolio through numerous cycles and their experience is invaluable during the current real estate cycle.", "With the additional $1.4 billion of loan loss provision above charge-offs in the fourth quarter, largely from home equity losses, our allowance for credit losses was $5.5 billion, up 37% from the third quarter. We believe the allowance is adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2007.", "In summary, the high credit losses we experienced late in the year were due in part to overall portfolio growth and the expected seasoning of portfolios following many quarters of unusually low loss rates. In addition, we experienced typical second half seasonality, especially in auto, higher loss rates in the liquidating home equity portfolio, which is now in runoff mode, and somewhat higher loss rates in the higher loan-to-value tier of the remaining home equity portfolio.", "While continuing to prudently provide credit to existing and new customers throughout 2007, we took aggressive action to exit higher-risk indirect channels, slow growth in the ongoing home equity and auto portfolios by eliminating and/or tightening higher-risk tiers, focused resources ahead of the curve on early problem resolution, and enhance our collection and customer management processes.", "Given the weakness in housing and the overall state of the U.S. economy, it is likely that charge-offs will be higher in 2008 than they were in 2007, but we believe our business model, the actions we've already taken to reduce risk, and our deep, experienced team, which has successfully managed through many prior cycles, will position us properly for the challenges that may be ahead, especially relative to our large bank peers.", "On December 31, 2007, shareholders equity was $48 billion, up $2 billion from a year ago. Our leverage, tier-1 capital and total capital ratios were 6.83%, 7.59% and 10.68%, respectively. Our capital ratios remained very strong, reflecting our ongoing focus on producing high risk-adjusted returns in all of our activities, and in turn, giving us capacity to continue to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities to produce strong returns for our shareholders.", "In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 83 million shares of Wells Fargo common stock. In 2007 overall, we repurchased 220 million shares, all but 80 million of which have been used to complete the acquisition of Placer Sierra Bancshares and Greater Bay Bancorp and also for employee stock option exercises, 401(k) matched contributions, and other employee benefit plans.", "At December 31, 2007, 42 million shares remain available for repurchase under board authority.", "One opportunity the challenging environment provides is the potential to do more acquisitions. Because of our strong balance sheet, we are in a strong position to take advantage of well-priced transactions. However, our disciplined M&A strategy has not changed, and we remain focused on niche opportunities that add to stockholder value. We will not do any acquisitions unless they meet our longstanding financial criteria for accretion and returns.", "During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Greater Bay Bancorp with $7.4 billion in assets, our third-largest bank acquisition in our company's history, making 2007 our most active banking deal year since 2000.", "We also just announced our agreement to acquire the banking operations of United Bancorporation of Wyoming, with $1.7 billion in assets. After completing this acquisition, Wells Fargo will be the number one in both deposits and assets among banks in Wyoming, that nation's ninth fastest-growing state.", "Our preferred use of capital is to invest in our businesses, particularly to build and strengthen our distribution. In 2007, we opened 87 banking stores and converted 42 banking stores from acquisitions, bringing our total retail store count to 3,298. We also added eight new commercial offices, and continue to add to our ATM network, adding 153 new, web-enabled ATMs and converting 908 to envelope-free ATMS during the year.", "We added a total of 578 platform banker FTEs in 2007 through both hiring and acquisitions.", "The company's effective tax rate for full year 2007 was 30.7% compared with 33.44% for 2006. Income tax expense for 2007 included FIN 48 tax benefits of $235 million for the full year, of which $130 million was in the fourth quarter, as well as the impact of lower pre-tax earnings in relation to the level of tax exempt income and tax credits.", "The tax benefits recorded in 2007 primarily related to the resolution of certain matters with federal and state taxing authorities and statute expirations, reduced by accruals for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48.", "In summary, despite a turbulent housing market and credit crunch, 2007 was another solid year for Wells Fargo, with double-digit revenue, double-digit loan, and double-digit deposit growth, increases in market share and wallet share, as well as effective expense management.", "While we did have an increase in credit costs, our costs were lower compared with most of those peers who also experienced credit and or asset write-downs.", "Our absolute and relative liquidity and capital positioned us better than peers to take advantage of opportunities as asset risk becomes properly priced. We look forward to taking advantage of these opportunities while maintaining our long-standing financial discipline in 2008.", "Thank you for listening, and if you have any questions, please call Bob Strickland, Director of Investor Relations, at 415-396-0523.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Baird & Co.", "Ron Mandel - GIC", "Nancy Bush - NAB Capital Research", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Operator", "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Tina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wachovia Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, January 22, 2008.", "I would now like to introduce Ms. Alice Lehman, Director of Investor Relations for Wachovia. Ms. Lehman, you may begin your conference", "Alice Lehman - Director of Investor Relations", "Thank you operator and thanks to everyone for joining our call this morning. I know it's been a busy morning. We hope you've received our earnings release by now, as well as the slides we'll be using in today's presentation and our supplemental quarterly earnings report. If you haven't, all of these documents are available on our Investor Relations website at wachovia.com/investor.", "In this call, we'll review the financial highlights package. In addition to this teleconference, this call is available to a listen-only live audio webcast. Replays of the teleconference will be available by about 1 PM today and will continue through 5 PM Friday, March 21st. The replay phone number is 706-645-9291, and the access code is 206047152.", "Our CEO, Ken Thompson will kick things off. He will be followed by CFO, Tom Wurtz and our Chief Risk Officer, Don Truslow. We will be happy to take your questions at the end.", "Of course, before we began I have a few reminders. First, any forward-looking statements made during this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause Wachovia's results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements are set forth in Wachovia's public reports filed with the SEC, including Wachovia's current report on Form 8-K filed today.", "Second, some of the discussion about our company's performance today will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information that reconciles those measures to GAAP measures can be found in our filings with the SEC and in the news release and supplemental material located at wachovia.com/investor.", "Finally, when you ask questions, please give your name and your firm's name. Now, let me turn things over to Ken.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Alex and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining our call on a very busy day. As you have seen in our press release, our fourth quarter results were poor. GAAP earnings of $0.03 per share and operating profit of $0.08 per share are not numbers that we are proud of and they do not in any way represent our expectations for the future.", "Our fourth quarter profits were severely impacted by $1.7 billion in marks, primarily in the fixed income division of our Corporate and Investment Bank, and by an overprovision of just over $1 billion to increase our credit reserves in the face of a very weak housing market. These actions were necessary based on what we believe is a very realistic view of the market challenges that we face in 2008.", "During the quarter, we took other actions to strengthen our company. As you know, today our subprime CDO exposure is just north of $800 million. We reduced our CMBS mark-to-market exposure by over $6 billion, while recording CMBS marks costing far less than what we believe, investors were expecting from us. We did a deep-dive review of our commercial real estate, retail mortgage and auto-finance portfolios, and we have a clear view of our positions in each of those areas as we go forward.", "We raised $2.3 billion of straight preferred equity in December and $800 million in trust preferred in September to improve their capital levels over third quarter levels. And after rigorous planning, we entered 2008 with good momentum in a number of our businesses; retail, small business, commercial, brokerage, asset management, cost of fixed income, asset-based finance, treasury services and our wealth markets. Nevertheless, based on recent action in our stock price, I am certain that investors are anxious about several questions on Wachovia, which I want to address now.", "The first question is, what is the level of the losses in your Pick-a-Pay mortgage portfolio? And as we have said since the Golden West acquisition, we looked at the Golden West experience of the early 1990s. At that time, California had 10% unemployment and 20% house price depreciation, and charge-offs peaked in 1994 at 20 basis points. Based on our portfolio today, that 20-basis point peak would translate to about $250 million in charge-offs. Our expectations for the this year are that charge-offs will exceed that historical peak. But even if charge-offs reach three or four times that peak, our Pick-a-Pay portfolio will generate very meaningful bottom-line profits in 2008. And I do not believe that investors grasp that fact today.", "The second question, does Wachovia have enough capital? After our December preferred offering, Wachovia's capital levels were higher at year end, and at the end of the third quarter in spite of the marks and in spite of the reserve builds that we did in the fourth quarter. And we are confident that those capital levels will increase as we go through 2008.", "And the third question, will Wachovia cut its dividend? And the answer to that question is we have no plans to cut the dividend, because we don't need to cut the dividend. We are confident in our ability to meet our 2008 business plan and that plan, as we have said before, will generate cash earnings that will cover our dividend payments, continue to build necessary credit reserves, improve our capital ratios and support growth in our business lines.", "So now with that introduction, I am going turn the floor over to Tom Wurtz, to review our fourth quarter results and later to Don Truslow, to give you a look at credit quality and risk management.", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Ken. Good morning to everyone on the phones. We appreciate the time you are investing in us. As you can see, we have changed the format of materials representing to include a highlights document to provide an overview of results and permit us to provide additional detail on topics, we think are of interest to investors. We also continue to produce the quarterly earnings report package, which provides the detail disclosures you are accustomed to.", "So, if I could ask you to turn to page one, you see GAAP earnings of $51 million or $0.03 per share and operating earning of $0.08 per share. These are the earnings for the quarter, so I am not suggesting you should think otherwise. But I would like to give you some sense for the baseline performance underlying these results by highlighting some of the big items which detracts it from earnings.", "We had approximately $0.90 per share of writedown and over provisioning. Also operating earnings reflect about $0.03 of non-merger severance expense, about $0.03 of additions to our legal approval and $0.02 impact from an accounting change related to recognition of credit losses. So, it's not hard to get back to a view of operating earnings in excess of a part of dollar per share. I hope as we go through this package, I can make you confident of several points, which I don't think are accurately reflected in our share price for debt spreads.", "First, as Ken mentioned our intention to execute on our 2008 plan that keeps the dividend very safe, provides ample capacity to build reserves, support balance sheet growth and permits us to meaningfully grow our capital base.", "Second, our remaining net mark-to-market exposure to further CMBS market volatility is relatively modest and there is only 25% of what it was just six months ago.", "Third, while we expect NPAs in the mortgage portfolio to continue to increase substantially over 2008, this clear evidence that our Pick-a-Pay portfolio is to-date performing very similar to that of the average prime portfolio in the industry, in terms of 60-day delinquency as an example.", "Four, our second lien home equity portfolio of $32 billion has a delinquency rate that is one quarter as high as the industry. And finally, we have a higher Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of the year than we did at September 30th.", "Now, turning to page two, net interest income is demonstrating solid performance in spite of rising NPA levels. We took action early on to make sure that we would be well positioned to benefit from following short-term rates and clearly based on what the Fed's action today confirms the best to most likely scenario over the course of 2008.", "On the fee income side, we had solid growth in the major line items, service charges, fiduciary and asset management fees, our commissions and the number of lines and the Corporate Investment Bank performed very well also. The provision of $1.5 billion compares to charge-offs of $461 million for the quarter. Expenses up more than you would expect from the addition of A.G. Edwards, because of the pattern of incentive accruals primarily in the Corporate and Investment Bank, non-merger severance expenses, ROE expenses and our continued commitment to investing in growth initiatives will bear fruits [ph] to future growth.", "However, 2008 expenses should benefit from expense synergies at Golden West and A.G. Edwards, as well as the actions we took in the second half of 2007 to rationalize our businesses. The tax rate of about 29% essentially reflects the recapture of taxes occurred earlier in the year, when we expected higher earnings for the year.", "Turning to page three, details on strong liquidity positions both at the bank and the holding company level. We are confident that we are very well positioned to deal with challenging markets and it continued our very disciplined approach to modeling our liquidity needs in this environment. We believe, we're one of the most liquid players among the major peers. We also believe that given the highly secured nature of our loan portfolio, our capital levels are appropriate, given our risk portfolio compared to peers. However, we do understand the power of the uptake of ratios, and as I mentioned earlier, we will take due-diligent and balanced approach to rebuilding capital levels, while we invest in the future.", "Page four shows that we grew core deposits 8% year-over-year, while low costs grew at 5% rate. We feel very well positioned to grow deposits in 2008. Due to the facts that are shown in the second bullet point, specifically leveraging the world savings franchise, we've had great results to-date and are very optimistic there. The A.G. Edwards FDIC sweep deposits will also be coming onto our balance sheet over the first three quarters of the year. We will make a very strong intent to have impounds for mortgage accounts that we originate going forward, plus building a mortgage escrow balances. De novo expansion will continue this year with about 110 new branches. And finally, with new product introduction, our Way2Save program, we think it has great merit and it will be very attractive to customers. So, we are very optimistic and we will do well on the deposit side over the course of 2008.", "Page five, summarizes loan growth overall consumers grew 3% linked-quarter, while commercials grew 8%. It's worth highlighting that home equity is down 5% year-over-year, as it clearly have not been reaching for growth. Furthermore, our home equity line of credit loans or ELOC have a lower drawer rate today than a year ago, and again we believe it's because the way we sell the product. We are not selling as the product that wait for customers to drain the equity out of their home, we're using it more of as a tax management product.", "In 2008, you can see we expect decent loan growth in the course of the year and expect better spreads as well. The banking market is generally fairly slow on the commercial side to adjust the widening credit spreads, but we are beginning to see some evidence of rationalization there, and what we can say is that we are going to do everything we can to meet customers needs. What we do after it reflects the facts that our costs are higher and our capital is worth more.", "Page six, shows key metrics for the General Banks. In summary, good loan growth with origination volumes reflecting a slower market and very good discipline, very solid deposit growth and record customer acquisitions and solid sales performance, and continued best-in-class customer satisfaction.", "Page seven, reflects the impact to increased credit cards to the General Bank's bottom line, which is down by 18% versus the fourth quarter of 2006. In 2008, we will continue with our de novo expansion activities, our Western expansion activities, with an intense focus on expenses and risk management discipline. The big driver of fee income will be service charges, interchange income and other banking fees. They are all positioned to grow well. Mortgage banking fees will continue to languish, but it's at a level which is fairly inconsequential to our overall results.", "Turning to Wealth Management on page eight. In a nutshell, record results on strength and fiduciary and investment management fees, strong client acquisitions and good expense discipline, we expect more of the same in 2008. The commercial mortgage insurance brokerage business has been relatively weak as a reflection of lower premiums in the markets. So we continue to have good sales activity, but the commission levels are simply lower in 2007 and it doesn't appear to be a near term, it's just for an improvement in 2008.", "Before we get to the Corporate Investment Bank, page nine gives a summary of mark-to-market disruption losses across the entire company. And so, you can see looking to the bottom line in the fourth quarter columns, you see total writedowns at $1.7 billion. Of that $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion is in the Corporate Investment Bank, $17 million is in the Capital Management Group on further writedowns to commercial paper assets taken out money market funds back in August, and $94 million in impairment losses in the parent, reflecting the review of all our equity and fixed incomes securities for others than temporary impairment.", "So compared to our 8-K filing which provided an update through the end of November, since CIB's losses were a little lower then expected for ABS CDO and other subprime-related assets at the just over $1 billion and higher for CMDS at $600 million and other items netted to a modest positive.", "So now turning to the Corporate Investment Bank, on page ten; principle investing results, relatively low as the third quarter results captured most unrealized gains in the direct portfolio through a partial sale of those assets in the accounting mark-to-market for the assets we continue to hold. So, we sold a portion of the portfolio, took the gain and that set a new branch mark for the market price. And so a lot of the gain was reflected in the third quarter and so relatively modest gains in the fourth quarter.", "Note that we have adopted a fair value of accounting as of January 1st of this year. So on a going forward basis principle investing results will depend on how the market performs that we will in the first quarter capture the unrealized gains in our funds portfolio. Origination, down about 13% from a year ago, reflecting a weakness in structured products and leveraged finance. But a very solid performance of high-grade global rates and M&A. Their traditional banking business and CIB continues to do well. But the provision expense is primarily associated with commercial real estate loans from the real estate lending business that was moved from the General Bank to CIB back in the early spring and we began reporting it as a sub-segment or a component of the CIB segment in our third quarter results. Losses there are almost entirely from residential-related real estate loans, with income property loans continuing to demonstrate very solid fundamentals.", "Page 11, provides detail on the CMDS leverage finance, mark-to-market exposure. As of January 18th, we had net exposure of $3.6 billion, of which 50% is AAA-rated or equivalent. Obviously price volatility for NASDAQ is heavily impacted by its duration, so we've added a data point to reflect the equivalent notional value of ten-year loans which would have the same price volatility as our mark-to-market CMDS assets. The graph on the right shows that you would expect our portfolio as the same price elasticity as the similarly rated portfolio of about $870 million in ten-year CMDS securities.", "The reduction in exposure is a function of three factors: sales, writedown and movement to our investment or loan portfolio. In Q4, after taking writedowns through our income statement, we moved $1.6 billion of loans to our loan portfolio. Similarly, subsequent to year end, we moved $2.5 billion of European real estate loans to our portfolio after marking them to market at December 31st. We view these assets as solid investments and I believe that the markets are significantly undervaluing the underlying cash flows and future performance. So again, any required remarks we would take to the income statement and then, we would make an independent decision as to whether we want to leave him in a mark-to-market portfolio or move them to a loan portfolio. In several cases, we have elected to move to a held-for-investment portfolio and for a reference the average LTV on the assets moved in the fourth quarter, which were around 57%. So it gives you a sense that they are very solid assets.", "We continue to have mark-to-market exposure to leveraged finance market through funded positions of $1.9 billion and unfunded commitments of $7.2 billion. We distributed about $2.5 billion in the quarter and have equity bridge exposure of only $15 million at this point.", "I'm not going to dwell on page 12, but point out that it shows the $684 million of exposure to ABS CDO subprime assets is $821 million at the end of the year, reflecting lower fourth quarter write-downs than we had originally indicated. So again, when we filed our 8-K most recently, we would have said... we would have had remaining exposure of $684 million that turns out in fact to be $821 million not reflecting any new assets we have discovered, but discovering the rights that we have to the assets and their performance is better than we would have anticipated at the time we did our 8-K. We have $4.178 billion of the super senior ABS CDO exposures, hedged with financial guarantees, of which $2.2 billion is hedged with mono-lines and $2 billion with AA-rated financial companies with market caps in excess of $80 billion each.", "We currently hedge our exposures to mono-lines through CDS markets, and believe we would loose about $400 million on these assets, if the mono-line protection was assumed to be worthless, and that prior to the hedges we hold against those mono-lines.", "Turning to page 13, you see metrics versus Capital Management Group. Q4 reflects the combination of an outstanding year, absent the addition of A.G. Edwards which was with us for the entire quarter, and brokerage was up 4%, per broker revenue up 4%, managed assets up 19% and solid expense control on a year-over-year basis. That translated to a margin over 23%.", "Asset management had a solid quarter, with a 30% improvement in margins compared to year ago. And to-date, broker revenue attrition remains right in line with the assumptions we made, when we announced the A.G. Edwards deal. So the integration continues to go very well there.", "As we turn to page 14, we see these metrics translate to segment earnings of $350 million, in spite of higher legal expenses and $17 million in additional marks on commercial paper assets. We feel very good about our execution from both an operating standpoint and on the integration front, and believe we are poised for strong result by a complete meltdown in the equity markets.", "Don will now go over about next nine pages, and I will finish up with our outlook for 2009.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Great, thanks Tom. As you aware, we are in a challenging credit environment driven by stress liquidity conditions in the capital markets which are further fueling, what is turning out to be an unprecedented decline in housing prices. The direct effect of this troubled environment on us is evident and increase non-performing assets and provision expense for our consumer mortgage loan portfolios and that portion of our commercial real estate loans which are tied to housing. Also there, if one is aware, we began seeing time to the end of the third quarter of how dramatically the housing market disruptions might affect borrowers and that conditions worsened materially, as the fourth quarter unfolded it. We responded by adding resources and focusing attention to handling problem loans and by aggressively selling properties what we need to foreclose and take the property back", "I will take a little additional time this morning from the usual to walkthrough our credit statistics. I think, the results this quarter reflect our rigorous efforts to better understand how these rapidly changing market conditions are affecting our borrowers currently and how they maybe impacting us and our customers over the next few quarters.", "I will start on slide 15. This provides a quick overview of some key credit statistics and as Tom mentioned, followed by nine slides, which provide a deeper look behind some of our portfolios. On slide 15, non-performing assets were up $2.2 billion, with nearly all of the growth coming in the form of non-performing loans. Foreclosed properties were up only a modest $55 million in the quarter. The increase in non-performing loans was driven by a $1.1 billion increase in consumer mortgage non-performing loans and $770 million increase in commercial real estate loans, again primarily residential-related commercial real estate loans.", "Provision expenses, as been noted was $1.5 billion, exceeded net charge-offs by... charge-offs up $461 million, exceeded those by about $1 billion very much in line with our pre-announcement from early December. Net charge-offs ran at a 41-basis point annualized run rate in the fourth quarter, finished the year at 22 basis points. Commercial net charge-offs during the quarter were 34 basis points annualized and consumer net losses were 46 basis points annualized.", "In dollar terms, our losses were up $255 million from the third quarter, primarily reflecting higher write-offs for commercial real estate, consumer mortgage and auto loans. Commercial real estate net charge-offs in our real estate financial services business, which is what houses our traditional commercial real estate business we think about and the commercial bank rose by $106 million, are reflecting write-downs across several residential projects. Consumer mortgage loan net charge-offs were up $108 million, with the largest increase coming from the Pick-a-Pay mortgage product, where losses rose by $80 million. Roughly $63 million of this $80 million increase in charge-offs for the Pick-a-Pay product during the quarter was due to a change in our loss recognition methodology.", "Estimated losses are now recorded when our loan reaches 188 days past due, versus the prior factors used before buying Golden West, which recognized the losses at the time of an actual property sale. So the $63 million in methodology change essentially constitutes a catch-up required to adopt this change. Losses in our dealer and services portfolio, which mostly consist of auto loans rose $49 million over the third quarter to $147 million, partly due to seasonality but also representing a weakening in market conditions. And then lastly on page 15, accruing commercial past dues at 90 days were 5 basis points and accruing consumer 90-days past dues were 23 basis points.", "Looking over to slide 16, as we pre-announced in December, our provision expense exceeded net charge-offs by just over $1 billion, leaving the ending allowance for credit cost at $4.7 billion or just over 1% of loans. The increase largely reflects changes during the quarter of our estimates for expected losses in certain portions of the consumer mortgage portfolio, the real estate financial services, commercial real estate portfolio, potentially tied to the residential projects and our auto loan portfolio.", "The largest increase in the allowance, roughly $550 million of the $1 billion over provision, relates to increased loss expectations for the portion of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, as a result of deteriorating conditions in the housing market during the quarter. We have begun experiencing higher loss rates, where we have loans in markets that experienced rapid price depreciation since 1999 and are now seeing a rapidly declining trend in housing values.", "Most of the builds in the allowance for the Pick-a-Pay product is for the loans in those markets, where the estimated current loan to values have risen or are expected to rise above 95%, were originated over the last three years and are exhibiting a higher likelihood of the fall. So, when you carve out this pool of loans that constitutes about $8 billion of the $120 billion Pick-a-Pay portfolio. After the build in the allowance balances, the resulting reserves loosely allocated for the Pick-a-Pay portfolio total about 56 basis points or a little more than three times the largest historical loss rate that Ken mentioned earlier in the portfolio... in his conversations. And the reason I say it loosely is because, there is not strict allocation in the loan loss reserve, again the entire loanloss reserve is available for losses in any part of the loan portfolio. Also during the quarter, we completed an extensive portfolio review of our residential builder... residential land and condo loans in our real estate financial services, commercial real estate portfolio.", "And as conditions deteriorated in the housing market during the quarter, we added nearly $220 million in the allowance against these loans, in addition to the increase in net losses we recorded during the quarter. The expected loss factors were also adjusted for the automobile loan portfolio, given the softening markets accounting for about $100 million of the increased allowance. So that gives a feel for what drove the $1 billion overprovision.", "Turning to slide 17, this provides a view of Wachovia's consumer mortgage portfolio, excluding the equity loan products, which we'll get to in a subsequent slide. Total mortgage loans were a $168 billion at year end, including a $120 billion of the Pick-a-Pay products. Starting first with more traditional mortgage products or non-Pick-a-Pay products. Loans totaled $48 billion and losses were a modest $16 million or about 13 basis points and non-performing loans were also at fairly modest levels totaling $253 million at the end of the quarter.", "For the Pick-a-Pay product the portfolio has an original loan-to-value, about 71% and on original FICO score of about 673. And as a reminder, the Golden West underwriting practices focused on a rigorous appraisal process and the borrower's ability to fund 20% to 30% of the purchase price upfront.", "Using estimated current valuation updates that we ran in November, the average current loan-to-value across the portfolio is basically unchanged from origination, coming in around 72%. Our review would expect there is wider distribution of values around that average. And given the significant weakness in the California housing markets, we have seen a run-up in non-performing loans or loans past 290 days or more were moved into non-perform, and a rise in losses as I had mentioned.", "Focusing on the non-performing loan portion of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, these loans have an average current estimated loan-to-value of about 81%. Charge-offs as I mentioned earlier, totaled $93 million for the quarter or about 31 basis points, but again roughly two-thirds of the charge-offs number was due to the change in loss methodology that I've touched on.", "At quarter end, there were a modest amount of foreclosed properties, about 634 properties, which originated in the Pick-a-Pay portfolio and represented $170 million in balances, of which about $130 million were homes in California. This compares with 562 properties and $155 million in balances at the end of the third quarter. Lot of great work is going on here.", "During the quarter we acquired 682 properties and sold 610 properties, with sales actually exceeding acquisitions in the month of December. We are very much taking the approach of aggressively pricing and selling collateral, as it comes back to us, believing that in this environment that the first loss is the lowest loss. The fact that we service these loans, they're on our balance sheet and we've got our own appraisers embedded in the markets. It gives us an advantage in being able to move these properties faster than many others are able to in the markets. The most problematic portion of non-performing loans is where the estimated current loan to values have risen above 90%. And stepping back and looking at the entire Wachovian-mortgage portfolio... Pick-a-Pay that also excluding home equity products. This balance was about $825 million at the end of the fourth quarter up from $380 million at the end of the third quarter and of course that's where we are focusing much of our effort.", "Given the stressed mortgage markets and the fact that the underwriting for Wachovia's Pick-a-Pay product is different from what is a typical option payment arm, and therefore admittedly a little difficult to categorize against other more common products. We have included the next two slides to provide some help in better understanding how this portfolio is performing in this market against traditional prime, Alt-A and subprime loans.", "So if you flip over to slide 18, this chart is the Wachovia Pick-a-Pay 90-day past due ratios and the green diamond line and the Wachovia overall mortgage portfolio inclusive of Pick-a-Pays is in the darker blue small square line against prime, Alt-A and subprime industry results. And you can see that the Wachovia results are performing well measured against Alt-A and just modestly worse than prime, and of course subprime performance has been rather dismal.", "Slide 19 provides essentially the same date about vintages. We have provided this to the extent that it would be helpful to 2006 vintage is performing a little worse than some of the other vintages and if you think about the California nature of the this portfolio and where prices peak, that's not overtly surprising. But we think that slide 18 in aggregate, tells a story that is may be not well understood in the market.", "Flipping over to slide 20, this shows the home equity loan and our lien positions for the quarter and the story continues to be a good one here relative to what's happening in the market around these products. Our home equity product loans and loans outstanding underlyings totaled $60 billion, with about $28 billion representing loan in a first lien position and $32 billion in a second or junior lien position. 80% of these products are originated through the branched networks, with the remainder originated through relationship customer mail campaigns or with our customers online, and we believe that this explains why our credits statistics have been so strong relative to other performance in the markets. Net charge-offs were $38 million for the quarter or about 25 basis points and non-performing loans were $342 million at the end of the year.", "On slide 21, we also thought it would be helpful to include some industry benchmarking data for our home equity products. The green diamond lines represent credits originated primarily in the branch network and the blue square line would include all of Wachovia delivery channels, so picking up the direct mail and the mortgage company. The chart on the left is information on closed and equity loans with the chart on the right covering home equity lines of credit. And as you can see in both cases the Wachovia product is performing very well against the industry using pass-through data as a gauge.", "On slide 22, we've provided some loan to value and FICO breakdowns across the entire consumer mortgage portfolio and we've published this chart before in various presentations. A couple of takeaway points. The second lien portfolio loan to values are shown as if the entire amount under the lines are outstanding, when in reality the usage under these lines typically runs around 35% to 40% pretty consistently through cycles. And actually at the end of the fourth quarter, usage was around 32% versus usage a year earlier of 35%.", "Next, the second lien outstandings for loan to values exceed 90%, are to high-quality customers, again originated through Wachovia channels. The non-accrual second lien balances remained modest at $58 million at the end of the quarter. We'd also like to note that we've included in the quarterly earnings report package an even more detailed breakout of our original FICO and LTV's prime mortgage products and you can find that on page 15.", "Looking over to slide 23, this provides some highlights on the auto portfolio. We are seeing an increase in credit costs in this area, due in part to the seasonal increases as the model year changes over. And we are also seeing some weakening in the marketplace and conditions as the resale market has blossomed and defaults have risen a little bit. Losses for the quarter were 2.35%, 30-days past dues have been trending up with the industry, but are running somewhat more favorably through the industry and as we look at 2008 and really think about this business, even though we are experiencing a loss in credit costs, the margins in this business remain attractive.", "And then finally slide 24 reveals our real estate financial services. Commercial real estate book which encompasses genres of our traditional commercial real estate lending activities. And as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we are seeing an increase in credit costs in that part of the portfolio which is residential in nature. And as of year end, our builder landlocked and our condo of loans in this portfolio totaled about $12.4 billion. Charge-offs were $109 million for the quarter. Just to give you a sense of the granularity there were a three larger write-downs of $23 million, $20 million and $9 million, with the remainder being losses, essentially running to $5 million or less.", "The average maturity of our loans here is fairly, short about 1.6 years and we are proactively taking steps to step in and strengthen our position as servicing events come up. And also as I mentioned earlier, during the quarter we completed a very thorough deep-dive regional review of this portfolio, which in part led to the reserve build and the decisions to take the write-offs that we set in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see continuing higher run rate credit costs in 2008.", "One other thing I want to touch on very quickly, that is not in the packed insurance model on financial guarantors, given the headlines that have been there in the potential for downgrades in the mono-lines. Similar to other large financial institutions, Wachovia has instruments and deals with instruments that are lapped by mono-line, our financial guarantors in a lot of different forms. Our direct lending exposure is very modest, currently less than $150 million and essentially unfunded commitments, and that's across all mono-lines. Most of our exposure involves, traditional insurance wraps that are designed to enhance the rating, therefore transaction execution of the underlying instrument, and these instruments are typically debt issued by highly-rated municipalities or local government entities, where we have underwritten the credit of the government entity without reliance on the insurance. Given the nature of these instruments and the quality of the underlying obligors, the credit risk here to the mono-lines we think is very, very small.", "We have been focused, as Tom pointed out, mostly on super senior ABS CDO subprime-related businesses, where as we point out on slide 12, our exposure is the highly graded mono-lines and totals about $2.2 billion. Using an estimate of loss that we use internally, which assumes that the underlying instrument defaults and the support from the mono-line is worth zero or basically default of zero, which we believe to be a highly unlikely case, where the insurance companies would be in a position to pay nothing. Our exposure to credit loss would be roughly $400 million, against this book and that does not describe any benefit to credit default-swap hedges which we currently hold.", "We also involved in other type of transaction, where we had various levels of support from mono-lines in a variety of forms. But overall we believe that our credit exposure is manageable in the event of the potential downgrades, especially taking into account of how the obligations of the mono-lines are generally structured to pay out of very extended timeframes. It's a little murkier for holders of these financial assets, as what impact downgrades would have on market prices or financial instruments, which carry this insurance support and the possible flow-through dispositions [ph] managed and marked, and this is different than credit risk and right now, it's just hard to gauge what impact potential downgrades may have on valuations.", "So, just to wrap up, in 2008, we are expecting it to be a challenging year from a credit perspective and we expect as we have seen 2008 get off to a start year, that the capital markets will continue to be turbulent and that unprecedented conditions in the housing market will continue at least through the first part of 2008, probably all the way through and we built our plans around that outlook and believe that we are taking the appropriate steps to manage through this environment and we'll continue to do so, as the year unfolds.", "And Tom, with that I'll turn it back to you.", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Don. And I will turn to page 25 in terms of giving a summary and outlook for 2008. Overall, we are thinking it's going to be environment that has GDP growth of somewhere around 2%. We would expect it to be an environment with lower short-term rates and a steepening yield curve and that should be an environment, where can expect good net interest income growth driven by deposit loan growth, wider spreads and the dilution we have taken with the balance sheet. We expect solid fee growth in services charges, interchange fees, fiduciary and asset management fees in commissions and those are some of the bigger categories for us in terms of the fee income line.", "In the Corporate and Investment Bank, we expect solid performance in global rates and high-grade treasury and trade finance, M&A and equity, and in our dislocated businesses we expect very nominal fee income, but do expect net interest income growth in those businesses, as spreads have widened appreciably. We expect the first quarter results to include FAS 157 estimated gains of about $250 million to $350 million, as I referred to earlier with a vast majority of that being associated with the funds portfolio in the Corporate and Investment Bank.", "On the expense side, we expect to show a continued expense discipline and we do have synergies to be derived from Golden West. We have the first Western conversion in the October timeframe. This year we will perform the Eastern conversion in early February. We'll have synergies from A.G. Edwards, and again we will have the full year impact of the actions we did in the second half of 2007. Just a remainder, first quarter results will include FAS 123R expenses for retirement-eligible employees, transfer of stocking options to those employees, and that will range $90 million to $100 million.", "We expect credit costs to continue to rise, but remain at manageable levels. I think at this point it's very difficult to look out to the entire year and provided guidance which we have a great deal of confidence in, but taking a look at the first half, we think that provision expense for the termination of charge-offs and whatever reserve buildings may be necessary, should remain below 75 basis points. Our minority interest should be in line with 2007 results and our effective tax rate will be somewhere in the range of 32% to 34%, and excess capital we use to pay the dividend fund growth and growth capital. So we do not expect any material levels of share repurchase activity. And so again that kind of leads back to this matter that we have is that we do expect the dividend to be safe, we expect to build reserves, build capital and support the growth in our business units.", "So with that, I'll turn to Ken.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, operator that completes our presentation. And at this point, we are ready to open the floor for questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line of Matthew O'Connor, with UBS.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello, Matt.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS Securities", "Hi, if I can just make sure, I understand the timing of loss recognition related to Golden West; at 90 days past due, you move them to non-performing and then, you don't charge them off so 180, correct?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Yes Matt, this is Don. That's correct. There is an estimate that now takes place at 180 days, where we value the property and go ahead and report a loss. And then, as that property moves to the foreclosure process, we would update that estimate as values change within the final recognition of loss being taken with the actual sale of the property.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS Securities", "Okay, I am sure it's case-by-case. But when does it move to the OREO bucket?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Well, essentially at 90 days it would move into a foreclosure process and then when we actually purchase the property back, it would be carried as OREO and the foreclosure process can vary pretty widely depending upon the stay and the volume of course or handling etcetera. So it can be 9 months, 12 months, in some cases a longer to actually get to an OREO status.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS Securities", "Okay. I guess as my concern is, the big NPA increase that you had this quarter, there could still be some lost content in there since you don't charge a loss until later. Is there anything that you can give that would give you more comfort there like for example, the properties that you sold in December that you highlighted for the losses on that and if they were what are the average?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Yes, we are seeing most of the foreclosed properties we sold as I mentioned have been in California. So they have been sort of the most stressed environments. In addition, as I mentioned we are very focused on steering the velocity of properties through the OREO process. So when we get one, we are aggressive about how its priced relative to the neighborhood, what goes into fixing the property up and we are willing to pay a premium to brokers to show and move our property et cetera. So, we are in a essence willing to take a little higher severity than perhaps historically the Golden West process would otherwise dictate.", "In December, severities I believe got to just under 25% and so, again you have to take that in light of where most of these sales have been, so the most severely impacted properties. And we have been helped by the fact that, we had 20%, 30% real equity on the front end and so I'd expect that those severities would be less than what some other sales are experiencing in the markets.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS Securities", "Okay.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "I don't know if that answers your question or not. But --", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS Securities", "Okay, no, it's helpful.", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And Don the current lender value on our NDA portfolio is 81%.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "That's correct.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS Securities", "Okay, and then just separately you had mentioned that you expected non-performers in the Golden West portfolio to rise this year. Any guessing in terms of how high this might go?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "I hate to forecast just giving what's happening in the housing markets, but I mean I would not be surprised to see the same sort of pace that we have had in the last couple of quarters, for the next couple of quarters.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS Securities", "Okay. Okay, thank you very much.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "And also I would just want to point out too, that we have in our plans for this year, as Ken indicated or alluded to, we have expected that charge-offs and our non-performs will be higher for the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. So we believe, we've built in a pretty realistic view.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Deutsche Bank.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "If you can just help me with some real simple questions, and one would be the Golden West portfolio has 31 basis points losses compared to a 20-basis point peak in the early 90s, so if unemployment is still very good at 5% and we are already seeing this higher level of loss rates, how do you think about that? I mean if unemployment really gets much worst, could it be more than let's say three times the prior historical peak?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Mike, this is Don again. Good question. Remember that in the 31 basis points is about two-thirds, that relates to the accounting change. So, I don't want to diminish in anyway the 31 basis points. But there is a little bit of acceleration, if you will, of pulling some charge-offs into the fourth quarter by that change in methodology.", "Ken laid out the scenario of auto [ph] losses to be three, four times what they were at their historical peak and how would that impact overall financial performance. It's just hard to know where right now these losses are headed, but I do think that we have got some realistic increases built into our plans which were captured in the guidance that Tom gave around of the 75 basis points. So we expect that losses will be higher for that portfolio than the historical peaks and that takes into account, what maybe happening in the economy as well.", "I don't know what the challenge is and we mentioned this before, a lot of this, the current loss has been coming out of California and they came from people that otherwise have the capacity to pay but have basically just decided not to, because the selective loss on equity value in their properties. So a way we may have, it's hard to know right now, but we may have seen somewhat of an acceleration of problem loans as people have reached that conclusion and we are just going to have to see how the patterns unfold from here.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "And Don if I can stay with you, I am looking at a January 11 edition of commercial mortgage alert and I can't say, I look at this weekly but when I look at the results for 2007, has Wachovia as the top-loan contributor to CMBS deals in 2007 and the number-one market share by a long shot and then, I compare that to what the CMBS has done from the past couple of weeks. And if you can just give some color, I guess that relates to your $600 million write-down for the fourth quarter, have you factored in the recent decline in the index. How much do you use the CMBS to take a write-down and how much risk do you think there is in the commercial exposure there?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Mike in the chart that Tom went over around the CIB business, we have been aggressively pulling on that risk positions down. We actually pulled back on transactions earlier in 2007 and actually did chose not to participate in some of the larger deals that are out there. So, I would just tell you that we have been aggressively managing risks around this portfolio on from a credit perspective. We don't see any material underlying deterioration in the properties or the loans themselves. And then the answer to your question about current marks and market conditions, that's what happened in the CMBS has been in a large part reason for the write-downs and the market marks that we have taken that $600 million in the fourth quarter.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "So that does reflect the past week or two?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Now the $600 million will be as of year end.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "So there might be some addition marks, if the CMBS were to stay at this lower level?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Right now, our evaluation of how the market has moved versus were we have priced the portfolio at year end, as there is might be some further deteriorations but not as nearly as significant as the deterioration we saw on the fourth quarter.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "And then the last question, on the CDO exposure that the mono-line ensures?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Yes.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I thought you said, you had like almost $2.2 billion of exposure for insurance on the CDOs, but if we had to have a loss, it would only be $400 million and I just... so that seem kind of low, given where a lot of the CDOs have been written down. If you can help educate me.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Yes, the $2.2 billion would not... that is after we have already taken some write-downs in some of those securities. So when we go through and we value the underlying collateral in those CDOs and then come back to what the shortfall would be if we had to liquidate that collateral and so therefore the mono-line just wasn't there at all, that's in essence how we get to the $400 million.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Alright, thank you.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "The other thing too is, each of these transactions is very unique and the mix of underlying collateral can drive different valuations. So it's hard to look at an index and generalize it to somebody's portfolio.", "Michael Mayo - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Just a little bit more clarity if possible on the commercial real estate charges that you talked. It sounds like you are saying the provision largely due to what the market is saying the expected valuation of the commercial real estate asset classes likely to be, but you are not seeing that in your fundamentals? Is that right?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Betsy, this is Don again. The portfolio review that we did and the way we basically grade assets. They are an asset-by-asset or a loan-by-loan approach. So it takes into account the borrower, guarantors, collateral, financial strength, what's happening in the specific markets where the project exist. So it is a truly bottom-up build into what the expected losses is we think it will be and then what's the appropriate amount of reserve against it.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And what type of economic scenario do you have as a base case in that announces? In other words if fundamentals in commercial real estate were to deteriorate, would that impact your numbers at all?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "We have taken into account that the residential markets in those markets are going to continue to deteriorate. So there... I mean it definitely has been our view again at the market level. So, very situation-specific as to what projects are there, what the absorption has been, what needs to come online, et cetera? So to the extent that there is a view that economic conditions will worsen in that market, that has been part of this whole process.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, but the fundamentals in the commercial real estate markets fairly are very strong right now?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "From the income producing side, right. But on the residential side, I think that we are beginning to see across the industry, many talk about softness on the commercial real estate project side of residential development.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Right, and that's embedded within your provision for this year... for this quarter?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Yes. Our income producing portfolio is performing very, very well.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And did you need to take any marks against those?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "There may be a little bit of provision and there might have been some write-offs in the fourth quarter against some of those properties, but it was a small piece. It was mostly all driven by the residential portion of commercial real estate.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Betsy just as... this is Ken. We are one of the largest, maybe one of the two largest CMBS master servicers. We have got over $300 billion of CMBS that we service, and across the board zip code by zip code, what we see there and what we see in our own portfolio, we have continued strong performance. And we've taken liquidity marks, but the actual behavior outside of the retail part of commercial real estate continues to be strong.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And am I reading slide 11 correctly that you have significantly reduced your exposure in the CMBS over the past several quarters?", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, you are.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And I have just one question, particularly in first part of this year, it looks like a material decline. How was that affected, was that through actual sales or was that maybe incremental hedge that you put on or a swap or something?", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Betsy, the one significant event that led to the difference between the December 31st portfolio bounce and the January 18 bounce was the movement of about $2.5 billion of loans that are European commercial real estate assets into the loan portfolio. So, we marked them at December 31st and that's reflected in our quarterly results, then as we came through the first couple of weeks of this year, we marked them again and then decided at this attractive risk-return profile. We would very much like to have these assets in our portfolio, once we move them into portfolio.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We also have been very aggressively selling our positions to going ahead and realizing losses and getting exposure off of our books.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Yes, I would suspect we have been more aggressive than any firm out there at selling down our positions and it's difficult to say. On the market side, we think we are certainly among the most conservative when it comes to the market side. It's probably also just clarifying for anyone that Ken's referenced to the commercial mortgage-backed securities servicing portfolio $200 billion $300 billion. That's at the absolute top of the capital stack when it comes to credit risk. I mean so there is extraordinary low level of credit risk in being the servicer of these deals.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and then just on capital you indicated that you issued some more trust preferreds in the quarter. Where are you with regard to trust preferred capacity at this stage?", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We are pretty well filled up on trust preferreds and so that's why we also issued $2.3 billion of straight preferred in the fourth quarter and that was remarkably well received and we think attractively priced.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and at this stage if there is any further deterioration in the economy, how would that lead you to think about your capital levels?", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well we go into the environment with a plan that allows us to again, meaningfully build reserves and meaningfully build capital over the course of the year, so... which is actually helping to merge, but I would say we feel very good about our position right now. That being said, if opportunistically there is a chance to issue more perk, we would likely do that.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay and then just lastly on the Fed rate cuts I think most of us have been anticipating some further declines might be getting a little bit sooner than expected. Can you just talk through how you plan on either passing through the Fed rate cut to your borrowers or to your depositors?", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think we have already announced reducing prime already this morning. So we've certainly passed it down to the borrowers from that perspective. And we still feel we're at a pretty good position with respect to management, the deposit portfolio where we'll be able to translate this Fed rate cut to kind of the elasticities that we have been anticipating. I think until you get down to rates below two in a quarter, you really don't end up napping up against many real challenges from further rate reductions on the deposit side, because again, we've built our plan assuming that there will be points of resistance from depositors and so, when we talk about our belief that we can grow net interest income strongly over the course of the year that's reflective of the fact that there is certain products that have very low rates today that are moving lower and other products will probably reach natural floors. And so it's entirely consistent with what we've planned for. In terms of the timing of the rate decrease, all that does is just simply improves the outlook for the first quarter, a modest amount but it was all embedded in the belief that rates will get down to somewhere between 2.5% to 3.25% this year.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of David Hilder with Bear Stearns", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns & Co., Inc.", "Don thanks very much for your discussion of the mono-line exposure. It's one of the more articulate I think we've heard. Could you just talk a little bit, if at all, about the CDS hedges against the mono-line exposure?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "David on page 12 in the footnotes, we indicate that we've got essentially...well actually that's with the large European bank. David right now, we've got probably $800 million or $900 million in credit default swap protection against the mono-lines. The thing I want add to that though is it's a very dynamic market. It is somewhat shallow and so we are I guess evaluating how we should adjust, if at all, our position in the credit default swaps against the mono-line. So I don't want people to get too locked on the $800 million or $900 million we may change that one way or another as we move along. But right now we've got $800 million or $900 million.", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's probably also worth noting down that we been very conscious of the counterparty risk when it comes to all our hedging strategy and feel extraordinarily good about the ability to question the counterparty. But we'd just say that with shallow markets, the price transparency is a little bit less today than a lot of times.", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. And then, back on a different issue, when you referred to that December severity number of 25% as I recall?", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns & Co., Inc.", "Is that essentially the loss against the amount of the loan or from some appraised value of the house?", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That would be the loss against the value of the loan. So, if you think about some markets in California that have given up 25%, 30% from their peak, that could entirely take away the equity that the burrower put in on the front end and may be a little more. And then you take into account the foreclosure costs, cost of fixing up the property going through foreclosure, the conditions that we are willing to pay to get the house moved. We've been willing to take some possibly higher severities in some markets to get the properties moved again, believing that the first loss is probably the lowest loss. And that of course is on OREOs that are coming other real estate owned that are coming through the pipeline. So properties that we've actually foreclosed on, and it doesn't really relate back to the NPAs.", "David Hilder - Bear Stearns & Co., Inc.", "Right, okay. Thanks very much. I do appreciate the additional detail.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Could you guys share with us on the movement of the commercial mortgages from the CMBS on to the balance sheet. What type of hair cut did you take on the $1.6 billion and the $2.5 billion that you did in January?", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's within the total marks of the billion that would have been the total of the third quarter and fourth quarter marks and mark-to-market CMBS position, so it's embedded in there. It wasn't a mark on a single day, it was a mark week after week after week and so finally accumulated to sum total. But I actually don't have that handy.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Would it be 5% to 10% or is that too aggressive being that high?", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I actually don't know at this point. I would say, these are the things that are in the upper tier of the capital stock basically.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Have you guys written-off any credit default swaps in the quarter, similar to Merrill Lynch. When they reported their numbers, they actually wrote-off some of their credit default swaps that they had with one of the mono-lines that is not doing very well?", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we don't happen to have any new foreclosure or any exposure to that particular company?", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then, you mentioned that you are taking a pretty conservative view on housing prices. Have you come out with any analysis of where you think housing prices may go from a year-ago to sometime in '08 or that you could share with us?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "This is Don. In our allowance view that we developed or described. When we put up the $550 million, most of that related to the Pick-a-Pay and the entire risk areas, we basically use a pretty widely viewed forecast published by moodyseconomy.com that looks at projected peak across declines in housing prices by MSA across the country, as kind of a beginning point and then we further stressed those. And if you stand back for about our analysis, basically what it would suggest is, in coming up with our allowance and expected loss numbers, a new portfolio weight across the country, we're looking to stay from mid 2007 to the end of 2008, at a decline of around 20%, with the bulk of that two-thirds of it maybe coming in 2008 about a third of it in 2007.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, that's a national average Gerard, made up of 200 and some different zip codes.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, that's weighted by our portfolio.", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right, weighted by our portfolio.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Which sounds very conservative, I give you credit for doing that. How does that square, if it is that severe which to me is unbelievably severe, how's that tied into your assumption that we could have 2% GDP growth in '08 with that type of assumption on the price declines for houses?", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I mean that just is coming from this variety of economists who are producing these estimates that's it. They simply are the metrics we are providing.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Again we used that published study as a backdrop and then take an even more conservative posture from that. So, I hope it doesn't happen, but that's the view that we've used.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "And just finally, on your construction loan portfolio of $18.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, what's the dollar amount of land loans in there?", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Land is... give me just a minute. I believe it's about $4.5 billion to $5 billion. But hold on just a second. It looks like it is just under about $4.8 billion.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Fitzsimmons with Sandler O'Neill.", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Hi everyone.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Kevin.", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "I was wondering if you can just... on credit, I know you've given a lot of detail today, but if you can help us reconcile with how and why we shouldn't come away thinking the allowance is very low and specifically the ratio I am looking at primarily is the allowance to NPA ratio being at only 88%, and which I am sure is well below peer level.", "And then secondly, for Ken this is looking at more broadly the model, the operating model. Given what's happening, we have been simultaneously getting hit on the steep, the banking side, the structure product side, the mortgage side. What does this do going forward to your commitment level to the diversified model and do you feel that you will get paid for that diversified model in terms of premium on the stock? Thanks.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Kevin, this is Don. I will take the first part of your question. In setting the allowance, we look at the expected loss at the end of every quarter and establish the allowance around that. In taking into account what's happening in non-performs, maybe a difference with our portfolio, a lot of our non-performs are in residential consumer real estate loans where so we are secured. Do you have equity... substantial forms with equity on the front ends, that while we are experiencing higher losses than say, we've in some cases experienced historically, the loss content still reasonably low compared to other types of loans, particularly on secured loans.", "And then the other factor that may come into play as well is we don't have a big unsecured credit card portfolio and typically those loan portfolios don't carry any non-performs, but they do carry very large reserves. So that can skew ratios in comparison across companies as well. And then the third part that we are beginning to see is company is putting out large provisions around home equity and we just haven't seen any significant deterioration to-date in our home equity portfolio.", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Okay. Thanks.", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And let me speak to the model. One of the things that we try to emphasize today is that if you look at all of our businesses, really across the company with the exception of structures products and with the exception of credit issues going on in the mortgage markets, every part of our company other than that is having excellent results. So, across our retail bank, across our small business in commercial bank and most parts of our Corporate and Investment Bank other than some of fixed income, our wealth model is working extremely well. We are one of the three largest brokerage companies now which works extremely well for us. We bank more than five wealth households in the country and we need the product lines that we got in order to do that effectively. So and we know, because of we track all sorts of revenue going between lines of business.", "So we are not concerned about the business model. We certainly know that the structured products business is going through a huge change right now. We do believe that overtime investors are going to want structured products. It will probably change in the way it's doing but we will have a platform that we will be able to deliver that whatever the change is. So, we feel good about the model and once we get through this period that model is going to be very attractive again.", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of David George with Baird.", "David George - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Couple of quick questions, first on Golden West, on the disclosure you provided is very helpful. Can you tell us how much of the portfolio, A) is making the minimum payment and then B) what the deferred net interest revenue is as of year end and then I have got one follow-up on fees.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "David this is Don. On the deferred interest, let me quickly answer you. I think it's about $3.2 billion, $3.1 billion which is up from $2.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, checking on this $2.7 billion, okay. And that $3.1 billion just to put it in context is about 2.5% of the loan balances. So, I know there has been some concern in the past about eroding loan to values on the deferred interest, so that's just not been impactful and then I am sorry your first question?", "David George - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "What percentage of the Golden West portfolio is making the minimum payment right now?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "I believe it's around and I look for this answer as well, but I don't... I shouldn't guess. I don't have that at my fingertips, but we can get back for you.", "David George - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay and then just a follow-up Tom, on the fee line is obviously principle investing and trading, moves around a lot. Just with respect to 2008, how should we think about this two lines and I guess what would you consider to be kind of a normal run rate for those two line items?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Principle investing will be relatively modest over the course of 2008 again, because in the third quarter we essentially mark-to-market the private portfolio and then, as we implement fair value accounting that was essentially mark-to-market the funds portfolio and so as you go into it there will be a modest discount on the implementation of FAS 157. So as securities were sold that discount will be released, but basically it will just be what our equity returns over the course of the year on a $2.5 billion portfolio. So, certainly more modest than it's been in the past. And on trading very difficult to say. Wish I could give you more guidance on that, but --", "David George - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, and Don, I'll just leave it at that... Don, on the Golden West minimum payment. When the deal closed, I remember the number was I think between 50 and 60, has that number gone up, what you say since the deal closed?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "I am sorry, David, in terms of usage?", "David George - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "In terms of the percentage of the book that's making that minimum payment?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "I don't believe it has gone up. The tricky part is and what I don't know is that it's different borrowers every month. So it's hard to look at the static percentage and assumed it's the same borrowers, but I don't believe it's gone up. But we will have to check that.", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "One thing I would say is when we talked about this topic at the time of the deal and then later on, our assumption was that it would be about $3.7 billion to $4 billion in terms of the deferred interest at this point, but it had less about and we had a point now on the rate cycle where the underlying entity will begin to come down and that will result and actually the acceleration of amortization of the loans since I would expect the rate of growth to diminish pretty quickly and in fact that it will likely go down to some point in next year and a half.", "David George - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Ron Mandel with GIC.", "Ron Mandel - GIC", "In regards to your guidance of little bit less amounts than you had in the past. You commented in your remarks that you expect that net interest revenue to grow strongly this year. I am wondering if you could give a little quantification of what growth strongly means and also maybe a little more numerical guidance of what you're thinking of about expense growth this year?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "No. We are not going to real explicit. Ron, what we'd say is that we expect loan growth in the mid to high single-digits across the entire portfolio. We expect widening the spreads, we expect deposit growth to be pretty strong relative to peers certainly and very attractive on an absolute basis. And we have positioned ourselves to benefit from falling rate environment. So, all those things should conspire to produce a very substantial growth and then from that you have to deduct the fact that as assets go to NDA, then you are losing the yield on those assets. So I think if you go through that equation, you will probably come away with a number that's within reasons, what we think.", "Ron Mandel - GIC", "So this sounds like you could be talking about double-digit net interest revenue growth, especially if the yield curve continues to stay even?", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I would say that's too unrealistic.", "Ron Mandel - GIC", "Okay, and expenses?", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Expenses should be relatively easy to gauge and that, I mean if you go back to probably the second quarter is a good reference point, you don't have a lot of confusing going on in the second quarter. We've identified what the efficiencies would be on Golden West and A.G. Edwards and we probably from expense actions we took over the second half of the year probably pulled out something in the neighborhood of $80 million to $100 million of expense on a run-rate basis and so we'll continue to show good expense discipline. So if you work all those things through, I think you'd probably come out to a reasonable expectation there. But that would be, it's very difficult looking at the last two quarters to get a good sense.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line Nancy Bush with NAB Capital Research.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Capital Research", "Good morning. A couple of sort of unrelated questions here. If you'd speak to the issue of A.G. Edwards broker attrition, we've gotten a lot of financial press stories and rumors about that. If you could just give us the numbers it will be very helpful.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Nancy it seems like every time we have done a deal in the brokerage area, we see anecdotal information that we are loosing a ton of brokers and the truth is, this is going exactly as we expected. The brokers that we are losing for the most part are what we call non-regretted attrition, meaning that they are... their annual commissions are very low and at the same time, we are recruiting the brokers. So I would just say we started out with a goal of 3% regretted attrition that is not losing more than 3% of the brokers, you produced 250,000 at year end in revenue and we are our on-target to meet that goal.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Capital Research", "Okay. And secondly Ken there has been a great deal of pushback on 'exotic' mortgage products with the Neg Am or the Pick-a-Pay mortgage being one in the ones that the financial press and some in Congress and others have sort of deemed to be evil instruments. Do you see a regulatory, any kind of possible regulatory strictures on the kind of products that you can offer on the mortgage company?", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I don't think Nancy on our option ARM products and of course, we have contended that all along we have been lumped therein with option ARM products of other companies and ours is vastly different. And so as we look at all of the things coming out of capital here and all of the things that the regulators are talking about, we don't see anything yet that would impact our ability are also the option ARM product that we've got, not underwritten to attrition rate, it's underwritten to a fully indexed rate. We've got caps on how much the payments can increase. We didn't do any of the 228 to 327 in term of loans in our Pick-a-Pay portfolio. So for the most part it's priced off the cost of CDs at our company. So we think we are in good shape there. We think that product is going to be attractive going forward.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Capital Research", "And I guess finally I would ask Ken I mean if...are there...is there any basis under which you can foresee that you might have to take an impairment charge on Golden West.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well my answer to that is no, but I am going to ask our Chief Financial Office to buttress that.", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure Nancy. The way that you take a look at impairment is you look at based on reported business segments and that business segment is under our retail and small business sub-segment and therefore that's an extraordinarily large business and so what you do is you rate the cash flows from the total business over the future horizon and compare that to the purchase price and it's very difficult to envision the circumstance for that would be required.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And just the point that I want to make one more time is if you look at...if you go back and look at the charge-offs in '94 of 20 basis point and if you'd say now on the portfolio we've got that it could be four times that as an example. So that would be roughly a $1billion on the size of the portfolio that we've got. Now that business is still very profitable business for us in 2008. so I just think there is a big misperception on the quality and profitability of the business.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Capital Research", "Alright and just one final question. I see that you have a new and I haven't looked at the specifics yet on the Way2Save. Product and this is kind of the first new flashy product, new product we have seen come out of the General Bank in a while. I mean is...are you able with everything else going on in the company and the deals that you are integrating et cetera, et cetera to keep the investment going in the General Bank and are we going to see sort of greater new products quite a lot out there or what's going on?", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes you will. And we have high expectations for the latest products and I can tell you Tom mentioned in his remarks, yes we are going to build a 110 new branches this year. We've built that many last year as we prioritize capital spend and expense stand going forward our Western Expansion, our Texas expansion and continued investment in our General Bank is at the top of the charts. I am going to say for instance, we've produced $45 million in deposits in the first ten days of that product line. So it would be guidance that we gave. One of the tenets of that guidance is we will continue to invest in our businesses and the General Bank is certainly at the top of the heap there and we are investing significant dollars in '07 and now again in '08 in that business.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Capital Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we are nearing the end of our allotted time for questions and answers. Your final question will come from the line of Jason Goldberg with Lehman Brothers.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jason?Hello.", "Operator", "Mr. Goldberg your line is open.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we lost him operator.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Jefferson Harralson with KBW.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, Jeff?", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Thank you. I have a couple of questions. One is the financing cost of the preferred and all other things equal does that add about, take out about $0.06 or $0.08 out of EPS?", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, that's a fair guess.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. And does the tangible equity ratio matter, and as you talked about raising capital or you have raised capital, is your level, the target ratio for the tangible equity ratio?", "Tom Wurtz - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We've typically talked about operating in the 450-460 range, and I don't think there is anything different at this point. So at the end of the quarter and we support to and so we'll build that over the course of the year.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Fair enough. And one final question if I can. I think it was the summer conference you mentioned that the risk was revealing itself in all areas of financial markets. And what I am hearing today, it sounds like that, you feel pretty good about most area of financial markets, but just a lot worse about structured finance and maybe mortgage losses. But can you... with the results now out, can you talk more about how risk is revealing itself in all areas of financial markets?", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I mean, ever since the beginning of the third quarter, when we began to see degradation in some of our structured products portfolios, we have been looking at that. We have probably as I think, we have reduced our expenses in our fixed income operation in corporate bank by 12%. We have decreased expenses in the structured products area by 25%. We will continue to look at those areas, but we do feel strongly that those businesses at the end of this cycle are going to become important again and I think we have done good job of keeping a nucleus there that will allows us to do business in those areas.", "I think if you look at our marks now in the third and fourth quarter combined, and then think about something that for instance that Mike Mayo said about how big we were in CMBS origination and yet look at the losses that we took. I think our risk management has been very good, and I think, in addition to that if you look at the provision expense in the fourth quarter and if you look at what we are planning going forward, I think we are being very conservative from a credits standpoint, moving forward.", "So, I think we are being very conservative, and I think we are optimistic about the future, given conservatism that we have already taken. And that's why we feel comfortable given the kind of guidance that we have given you as far as covering the dividend, growing capital ratios, growing our business and we are optimistic about Wachovia. Frankly, it's just hard for me to understand the impact that our stock price has taken over the last three months, because I'll look at how we compare to others and I feel very good about where Wachovia is.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Alright, thanks a lot. That's very helpful.", "Operator", "At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management.", "Ken Thompson - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay Operator, thank you and I think I just made my closing remarks like this. So, I will just say that we appreciate your interest in us in a very busy week. And as usual Alice Lehman and her team are available to take your calls as follow-up to this call. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's Wachovia fourth quarter 2007 earnings release conference call. This call will be available for reply beginning at 2.30 PM Eastern Standard Time today through 11.59 PM Eastern Standard Time on March, the 31st, 2008.

Thank you for calling into the Wells Fargo First Quarter 2008 Earnings Review Pre-recorded Call. Before we talk about our first quarter results, we need to make the standard securities law disclosure. In this call we will make forward looking statements about specific income statement and balance sheet items and other measures of future results of operations and financial conditions, including statements about future credit quality and losses generally and specifically that we expect loss rates in the first mortgage portfolio to increase if housing prices continue to decline.", "Based on the current interest rate environment most of our adjustable rate mortgages at Wells Fargo Financial scheduled to reset during the remainder of 2008 will reset at or below their current rate, and that we expect the performance of the liquidating home equity portfolio to continue to deteriorate until real estate markets begin to stabilize or until we manage through the most distressed customer segments. Forward looking statements give our expectations about the future. They are not guarantees, and results may differ from expectations. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date.", "For a discussion of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations refer to our SEC filings including the 8-K filed today, which includes the press release announcing our first quarter results, and to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and to the information incorporated into those documents. Now I will turn the review over to our Chief Financial Officer, Howard Atkins.", "Howard Atkins", "Wells Fargo earned $2 billion after tax or $0.60 a share in the first quarter despite a $2 billion pre-tax provision for credit losses, which included an additional $500 million credit reserve build. Our ability to earn through these higher credit costs reflected the benefit of our diversified business model as well as attractive growth opportunities we have taken advantage of in these challenging markets. We continued to steadily and profitably grow the franchise without compromising our operating margins.", "In fact, key operating margins actually widened in the quarter, while at the same time we continued to fortify our strong balance sheet. In terms of business growth, we achieved record sales in consumer banking, record cross sell in both our retail and commercial businesses, double digit growth in earning assets and loans. Near double digit growth in deposits and fee income, all of which contributed to producing 12% top line growth year over year.", "Double digit revenue growth, once again was broad based across our 80 plus businesses, with commercial banking, asset based lending, insurance, international, wealth management, regional banking, debit and credit cards, business direct, SBA lending, business payroll and mortgage banking all posting double digit year over year revenue growth. Despite the slump in housing and the periodic dislocations in the secondary mortgage capital markets, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage applications rose 45% from the fourth quarter to $132 billion the highest quarterly mortgage application volume since the height of the refi boom in the fall of 2003.", "Operating margins remained strong and actually widened in first quarter. Operating leverage, the difference between revenue growth which was up 12% and expense growth which was down 1% was very positive and continued to improve, reflecting the combination of strong revenue growth with expense discipline. Our net interest margin, at 4.69% remained one of the best among large US banks. The seven basis point increase in the net interest margin from fourth quarter to first quarter, reflects the benefit of having correctly positioned, since early 2007, for the decline in short-term rates that has now ensued along with continued good growth in core deposits and disciplined deposit pricing.", "Even with the higher credit costs incurred in the quarter our return on assets at 1.4% and our return on equity at 16.9% remained among the top of our peers. Pre-tax pre-provision profit, in other words, revenue less non-interest expense, grew 30% from first quarter 2007 to $5.1 billion, a quarterly record driven in large part by 21% growth in average earning assets since last year. Most of the growth in earning assets came from steady commercial and consumer loan growth along with selective purchases of very high quality, mostly AAA, securities at very attractive yields as credit and liquidity spreads continued to widen in the past few quarters.", "As you recall, in past years our assets did not grow appreciably as we believed and said all asset classes were significantly overvalued and were not adequately priced for risk. This has now totally changed with many asset classes now undervalued affording us the opportunity to buy assets at very attractive risk adjusted spreads. At the same time we have exited, scaled back, run-off, priced-up or tightened terms on riskier segments within all of our loan portfolios.", "With the growth in higher quality assets and the run-off in older, lower quality assets, the composition of our portfolio has steadily shifted towards less risky loans and securities or assets with better risk-return characteristics. During the quarter we charged-off $1.5 billion of loans and further bolstered the allowance for loan losses with a $500 million credit reserve build, in other words, provision exceeding charge-offs. Liquidity remained strong, in part due to our continued growth in core deposits from both retail and business customers.", "During the quarter investor demand for our debt securities remained strong, and we successfully bolstered liquidity by issuing $6 billion of new term debt and $1.6 billion of tax deductible capital securities. At quarter end we had significant remaining capacity to issue lower cost capital securities if necessary to keep capital growing in line with attractive asset growth. With that summary of the great combination of growth, profitability, and risk reduction, let me now describe the results of our major business lines in some detail.", "I\u2019ll start with our commercial businesses. Our Wholesale and Commercial Banking Group, which serves primarily middle market customers and select niches in the large corporate market, had double digit loan and double digit deposit growth. Revenue grew $80 million, or 4% from first quarter 2007. Higher trust and investment fees, deposit service charges, foreign exchange income, institutional brokerage and insurance revenue were offset by a lower level of commercial real estate brokerage fees, which were very high a year ago, and a lower level of capital markets activity. We achieved record cross sell of 6.2 products per wholesale relationship and 7.7 products per middle market commercial banking relationship.", "Almost one of every three of our commercial banking offices had more than 8 products per customer relationship. The Wholesale Banking Group\u2019s average loans grew 29% year over year as a result of new customers and opportunistic, attractively priced acquisitions of high quality assets. Asset based lending, middle market lending, international, commercial real estate and specialized financial services, which include our capital markets activities and relationships with Fortune 500 companies, all continued to experience double digit loan growth.", "Throughout the market dislocations of the past three quarters, we have been very clear with our business relationships that we are open for business and we have been actively meeting the financing needs of our wholesale customers resulting in increased market share while maintaining our conservative underwriting standards. Wholesale Banking Group\u2019s average core deposits were up $15 billion or 29% from first quarter 2007.", "The growth came primarily from large corporate and middle market relationships, international and correspondent banking customers and from higher institutional sweep and liquidity balances from our Asset Management customers. The Insurance Services group had double digit revenue growth. Wells Fargo Insurance, Inc., our consumer and small business insurance group grew revenue by 17% from first quarter 2007 driven by sales of identity theft protection, debt cancellation and crop insurance products.", "Wells Fargo Insurance Services, Inc., our middle market commercial insurance broker, achieved 16% revenue growth adding seven new insurance brokerage businesses across the country last year.", "Despite the 7% decline in the S&P 500 index from a year ago, Wells Fargo Advantage Funds, our mutual fund business, grew average assets by 28% from a year ago and ended the quarter with $156 billion in fund balances, becoming the second largest fund manager among US banks.", "This growth was driven by strong demand for our Money Market Mutual Fund products. Fifty three % of the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds were in the top two Lipper performance quintiles for the past three year period. Wholesale net income this quarter was only minimally impacted by the capital markets dislocation that has resulted in billions of dollars of write downs at other financial services companies.", "During the first quarter, $39 million in expenses were recorded for a previously disclosed capital support agreement provided to our AAA rated non government money market mutual funds, which had a small investment in one third party SIV that required some credit write downs. Wells Fargo does not act as a sponsor for any SIV\u2019s. We also took $63 million of net write downs in our Commercial Mortgage held for sale portfolio as a result of widening credit spreads.", "At the same time, the continued market volatility in the first quarter created opportunities for our financial products group to expand customer sales volume and earn higher spreads. While equity capital gains declined from a year ago, sales and revenue of equity, commodities, interest rate and brokerage fixed income products reached quarterly records.", "Now I\u2019ll shift to the Community Banking Group. The Community Banking Group, which includes regional banking, wealth management, home equity, mortgage banking and retail internet, had double digit revenue growth, up 16% from first quarter 2007, driven by double digit fee and loan growth and strong deposit growth. Net income declined $72 million from a year ago, and included a pre-tax credit reserve build of $385 million.", "During the first quarter, regional banking achieved record core product sales of 5.8 million, up 17% from first quarter 2007. For the first time ever we provided over 2 million solutions to customers in a single month. These exceptionally strong sales results continued to be driven by customer demand, improved store based service levels, higher productivity, and deeper customer penetration. Our sales growth benefited from greater banker productivity. We continued to invest in adding more sales people, with platform banker FTE\u2019s up 7% from a year ago, but sales grew at almost two and a half times that rate.", "We measure this increased productivity through core sales per platform banker FTE per day. In the first quarter core sales per platform banker FTE was a record 5.64 per day, up from 5.08 per day a year ago, an 11% increase. Once again, Regional Banking achieved record cross sell. The average retail bank household had 5.6 products with Wells Fargo, up from 5.3 products a year ago and up from around three products 10 years ago.", "To put this in perspective, in order to increase cross sell from 5.3 to 5.6, regional banking had to increase the total number of products our customers own by nearly three times the rate we grew the number of our retail bank households. Six of our 32 regions now have an average retail bank household cross sell of over six. Twenty three % of our retail customers had over eight products with us. Our long term goal, nearly double the amount of customers who bought eight products five years ago, and in our top region, 32% of our customers had over eight products with us.", "We have had strong growth across many product lines including Wells Fargo Packages, which include a checking account and at least three other products such as a debit card, credit card, or savings account. Package sales were up 32% from first quarter 2007, purchased by 72% of new checking account customers. Total card fees, including credit and debit card, were up 19% from first quarter 2007. At quarter end, 38% of our retail bank consumer households had a Wells Fargo credit card, up from 36% a year ago and up from 27% five years ago.", "Purchase volume on consumer bank cards was up 18% from first quarter 2007 and average balances were up 30%. Ninety one percent of our consumer checking account customers had a debit card, up from 86% five years ago, and debit card purchase volume increased by 11% from first quarter 2007. Deposit fees from both consumer and commercial customers continued to grow, up 9% from a year ago. This growth was driven by volume, not price increases.", "Average core deposits of $317 billion grew 9% from a year ago and 3% annualized on a linked quarter basis. Average mortgage escrow deposits were down $205 million from first quarter 2007 and up $572 million from fourth quarter 2007. Excluding mortgage escrow balances, average core deposits grew 10% from first quarter 2007 and 3% annualized on a linked quarter basis. Average retail core deposits, which exclude wholesale banking and mortgage escrow deposits, were up 5% from a year ago and 4% annualized on a linked quarter basis.", "The average balance per retail account continued to decline slightly. We continued to be disciplined in our deposit pricing. The average rate on our interest bearing core deposits declined 70 basis points from fourth quarter. Despite the lower rates, we continued to have good account growth with consumer checking accounts up a net 4.9% and small business checking accounts up a net 2.8% from last year.", "California continued to be our fastest growing market, with new consumer checking accounts up a net 5.7%. This was the eleventh consecutive quarter where net new accounts in California exceeded the average across our footprint.", "Better serving our small business customers resulted in store based business solutions increasing 9% from first quarter 2007. Sales of Wells Fargo Business Services Packages, which include a business checking account and at least three other business products such as a business debit card, credit card, or business loan or line of credit, were up 24% from first quarter 2007 and were purchased by 47% of new business checking account customers.", "Loans to small businesses, loans primarily less than $100,000 on our business direct platform, grew 14% from first quarter 2007. These strong sales results increased business banking household cross sell to 3.6 products, up from 3.4 a year ago. The Wealth Management Group achieved double digit revenue and net income growth by continuing to meet the needs of existing customers and gaining new customers who are seeking a trusted institution during these challenging economic times.", "The Wealth Management Group grew revenues by 12% and net income by 21% from first quarter 2007. These strong results were driven by double digit loan and deposit growth. WellsTrade, our on-line brokerage service, had double digit revenue and net income growth and continued to attract and retain customers with account levels up 14% and assets up over 20% from first quarter 2007. Also driving growth was the introduction during the first quarter of the Family Wealth Group, serving ultra wealthy families who manage their wealth across generations with at least $50 million in net worth.", "The Family Wealth Group, part of The Private Bank, combines superior investment management and risk management capabilities with a broad view of wealth management that includes family enterprise governance and legacy planning. We have a long history of helping families manage their wealth and have a significant presence in the ultra high net worth market segment. The Family Wealth Group currently has $7 billion of assets under management.", "Internet sales are an important channel for overall sales growth with consumer product sales up 10% from first quarter 2007. We had over 10 million active online consumers, up 13% from a year ago with 66% of all Wells Fargo consumer checking account customers are now active online customers. We now have over one million active online small business customers, up 18% from a year ago. We continued to build our physical distribution to better serve our retail and small business customers, opening 11 banking stores and converting 18 retail stores from Greater Bay Bancorp.", "We are now serving our retail customers through our 3,321 stores in 23 states. We also added to our ATM network, adding 16 webATM machines and converting 136 to Envelope Free webATM machines.", "I\u2019ll shift to Mortgage Banking. Despite the continued downturn in the economy and in home prices in the first quarter and despite the dislocation in the secondary mortgage capital markets, first quarter was one of the best quarters ever for our mortgage business. Mortgage retail originations increased $8 billion, or 31%, from a year ago even though we continued to tighten pricing and underwriting standards throughout 2007 and into early 2008.", "During the last year the industry has seen a meaningful shift from nonconforming mortgage originations to proportionately more agency conforming and federally guaranteed mortgages, both of which are traditional Wells Fargo origination strengths. We have picked up substantial origination market share in these core mortgage products. Mortgage applications grew 17% from a year ago and were up 45% un-annualized from fourth quarter.", "About 62% of these applications were for refinancing. The $132 billion in applications taken this quarter were the highest since third quarter 2003 and we ended first quarter with an unclosed pipeline of $61 billion, up 42% from the start of the quarter. Our owned servicing portfolio grew 10% from a year ago, somewhat more moderate growth than in prior periods because lower mortgage rates caused more mortgage payoffs and we have been much more selective in the type of servicing we are buying, shifting much more to higher quality loan pools and substantially less sub-prime and Alt-A servicing rights.", "First quarter turned out to be one of the more challenging quarters for hedging the accounting risk in mortgage servicing rights, with significantly more pronounced and more frequent changes in interest rates and mortgage credit spreads throughout the quarter, yet our MSR hedging process continued to operate effectively. First quarter net servicing income included a net MSR gain of $94 million consisting of a $1.8 billion reduction in the fair value of MSR\u2019s offset by a corresponding $1.9 billion gain in the value of the economic hedge.", "In addition, as rates dropped significantly at one point in the quarter, we realized $323 million in gains by selling $13 billion of MBS securities that were hedging the MSR, ultimately replacing these securities largely with off balance sheet hedges when rates moved back up in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the ratio of capitalized MSRs to the total amount of mortgages loans serviced for others was 1.08% the lowest ratio in four years and a 12 basis point decline from fourth quarter.", "The decline in the ratio was driven by lower market rates as well as sales in mid 2007 of a portion our excess servicing to improve the risk profile of the servicing asset and take advantage of market conditions for excess servicing at that time. Over 90% of the mortgage loans we service are for prime customers. Delinquencies in our residential mortgage servicing portfolio were down on a linked quarter basis due to expected seasonality, with customers benefiting from tax rebates, annual bonuses and lower post holiday spending.", "The weak housing market, however, resulted in higher delinquencies from first quarter 2007 and foreclosures were up both linked quarter and year over year. While the foreclosure rate continued to increase, to 1.02% at quarter end, we believe it was still better than the industry average. We continued to work closely with our customers to keep them in their homes. For example, we work across our portfolios when a home equity loan becomes delinquent and Wells Fargo services the first mortgage.", "With one point of contact for both loans, we are able to better serve our customers and investors. Loan modifications and workouts continued to increase in the first quarter and were up significantly from last year. We are also working with Washington on the proposed rescue plans providing input on both the positive and negative implications of the proposed plans. Net gains on mortgage loan origination and sales activities for the first quarter benefited from the actions we took during 2007 and first quarter 2008 to reduce risk by tightening credit standards and by eliminating certain distribution channels and loan products.", "However, net gains on mortgage loan origination sales activity was negatively impacted by the illiquidity in the secondary mortgage market for nonconforming and adjustable rate mortgages and resulted in $108 million in write downs during the quarter to reflect the decline in the fair value of the mortgage warehouse and pipeline for these prime products. Unlike the third and fourth quarter of 2007, we chose not to securitize and retain in our investment portfolio a significant portion of nonconforming originations in the first quarter, primarily because yields were lower in first quarter.", "In addition, mortgage origination gains were reduced by $107 million primarily to reflect a write down of repurchased mortgage loans and an increase in the repurchase reserve. The net gain on mortgage loan origination sales activities also included a $48 million reduction in fair value of servicing associated with mortgage loans in the pipeline and warehouse.", "Now I\u2019ll talk about credit quality. The credit environment remained challenging this quarter. Net charge offs in the first quarter were $1.5 billion, or 1.6% of loans annualized, up from $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The majority of the increase was in our consumer loan portfolios as our customers continued to be negatively impacted by the downturns in residential real estate and the general economy. In the commercial portfolios the increase in charge offs was primarily from loans originated through Business Direct, while loss levels in our commercial loans to mid sized and large corporations remained modest.", "Total nonperforming assets were $4.5 billion, or 1.16%, of loans in the first quarter compared with $3.9 billion, or 1.01%, of loans in the fourth quarter. The majority of the increase in nonperforming assets was concentrated in portfolios affected by residential real estate, consistent with the rise in foreclosure rates in many markets. Due to market conditions, we continued to hold more foreclosed properties than we have historically.", "Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, excluding insured and guaranteed GNMA and similar loan balances, increased by $72 million from fourth quarter, a substantial reduction from the $296 million linked quarter increase in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. The modest first quarter increase was positively impacted by improvement in the auto portfolio and a more modest increase in consumer real estate secured portfolios and credit cards.", "Let me review the individual loan portfolios in detail, and I will begin by focusing on our exposure to the residential real estate market. Reflecting the continued downturn in housing, the $73 billion first mortgage portfolio had somewhat higher losses with first quarter annualized charge offs of 0.41%, that is only $75 million in total losses on the entire $73 billion first mortgage portfolio for the quarter, up $41 million from fourth quarter.", "This increase was expected, and if housing prices continue to decline we would expect loss rates to increase further. However, our loss rates remained within expected ranges and also remained lower than industry levels because we never offered and never portfolioed the more problematic first mortgage products that are hurting others in the industry. Our first mortgage portfolio consisted of $24 billion of real estate secured loans held at Wells Fargo Financial, $12 billion of home equity loans in the first mortgage position, and $37 billion of mostly prime customer relationship based first mortgages held at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, regional banking, and our Wealth Management Group.", "As we continued to tighten our underwriting standards in the first quarter, growth in this portfolio slowed. We once again adjusted our maximum LTV\u2019s based on local market conditions, increased our minimum credit scores and further adjusted our risk based pricing. At quarter end, Wells Fargo Financial had $28 billion in real estate secured loans. The majority of this amount, a total of $25 billion, was debt consolidation loans that were originated through Financials US retail stores.", "Let me give you some additional characteristics of this $25 billion debt consolidation portfolio. Ninety six percent was in the first lien position. This customer portfolio was originated by Wells Fargo Financial team members and does not include interest only, stated income, option ARM or negative amortizing loans. New real estate customers primarily come from outbound calling to customers with an existing Wells Fargo relationship where we can clearly demonstrate a tangible benefit for our customers by improving their financial situations through debt consolidation.", "We conservatively underwrite these loans with full documentation and require income verification. Sixty two percent of this portfolio had a FICO score above 620. The average LTV was 78%. The average loan size was $131,000. Approximately 51% of the portfolio was fixed rate loans. The remaining loans were 3/27 adjustable rate mortgages with a fixed payment for the first three years of the loan. These loans were underwritten to the fully indexed rate and do not contain teaser rates.", "Based on the current interest rate environment, starting in the second quarter most of our adjustable rate mortgages that reset throughout the rest of 2008 will reset at the same rate or below their current rate, which will actually reduce customer monthly payments. Like other real estate secured portfolios, delinquencies and charge offs have increased due to the weak housing market, yet total first quarter losses were still a very low $34 million on the entire $25 billion portfolio, a 0.56% annualized loss rate.", "The credit performance for this portfolio has continued to perform better than published industry rates for non-prime mortgage portfolios. Our National Home Equity Group manages an $84 billion home equity loan portfolio whose balances are relatively flat from year end. As we previously disclosed, we segregated $12 billion of higher loss content home equity loans, primarily sourced through third party originators into a liquidating portfolio.", "The first quarter annualized loss rate in the liquidating portfolio was 5.58%. This portfolio accounted for 37% of home equity charge offs in the first quarter despite making up only 14% of total home equity balances. Since 63% of the liquidating portfolio had a combined loan to value of greater than 90% at quarter end, based on updated home values as of December 31, 2007 where available, our expectation is that this portfolio\u2019s performance will continue to show high losses until real estate markets begin to stabilize or until we manage through the most distressed customer segments.", "Losses in the liquidating portfolio produced $47.6 million in net charge offs for the month of December and produced $163 million in the first quarter 2008. While 38% of the liquidating portfolio\u2019s balances related to properties located in California, only 2% was located in Central California, a region which has experienced some of the highest loss rates. The core home equity portfolio had an outstanding balance of $72 billion, relatively flat from year end. This core portfolio had a first quarter annualized loss rate of 1.56 %. Declines in home prices and economic weakness contributed to this loss rate.", "Approximately two thirds of this portfolio was either in a first position or a second behind a Wells Fargo first. Ninety eight percent were retail originated which have performed better than loans originated through third party channels. Thirty percent had an updated combined loan to value greater than 90%. This portfolio is very geographically diverse. Within the core portfolio the Central California region representing about 2% of the portfolio and Florida representing about 4% have experienced weak performance.", "However, Minnesota representing 6% and Texas representing 4% have remained relatively stable.", "In this challenging real estate market it is necessary to have more time to work with our customers to identify ways to help resolve their financial difficulties and keep them in their homes. In order to provide this additional time to assist our customers, beginning April 1, we changed our home equity charge off policy from 120 days to 180 days, consistent with FFIEC guidelines.", "Credit losses in the Wells Fargo Financial $28 billion auto portfolio, which included $2.5 billion in auto leases, declined $6 million from fourth quarter due to seasonality and increased only slightly, $31 million over first quarter 2007. Both total delinquencies and 90 days past due and still accruing declined 25% on a linked quarter basis. Delinquencies were down 4% and 90 days past due were down 21% from first quarter 2007.", "Over 70 % of the auto portfolio had a FICO score above 620. The size of our auto portfolio declined 16% annualized from last quarter and 9% from last year reflecting a tightening of account acquisition strategies to reduce loan volume in higher risk tiers and tiers with unacceptable returns. We are very pleased with the reduced risk in our loan portfolio which reflects the tangible progress we have made under a new management team after having installed new collections and underwriting systems a year ago, along with tighter underwriting and pricing.", "Two other retail portfolios that are important to our credit performance are credit card and business direct. The $12 billion Community Banking credit card portfolio is primarily issued to our banking customers within our banking states. While losses are increasing from historically low levels as a result of higher bankruptcy rates, seasoning of the portfolio, and continuing economic pressure on consumers, they were within our normal expected range.", "We continue to proactively manage these accounts. For example, we are tightening our new underwriting standards, which are reducing new customer growth, but resulting in higher quality new customers. We are increasing rates on our higher risk accounts and reducing lines and closing accounts where appropriate. Since the vast majority of our bank card customers have other relationships with Wells Fargo, we also monitor customer behavior with other products and manage these accounts accordingly.", "Wells Fargo Financial has a $7.4 billion credit card portfolio which was down 3% from fourth quarter 2007. These cards are primarily sold to existing Wells Fargo Financial customers and through retailers and manufacturers with large dealer networks, not through mass mailing campaigns. Losses in this portfolio have increased; however, we have made significant investments in default management, continue to tighten underwriting standards, and appropriately price for risk.", "Our $11.7 billion business direct portfolio consists primarily of unsecured small loans and lines of credit to small business owners nationwide with an average balance of less than $20,000. These loans are included in our commercial loan totals, but have tended to perform in a manner similar to credit cards and unsecured consumer loans. We have been in this business since the early 90\u2019s and while losses are increasing, they were within our long range expectations.", "The increase in losses has primarily occurred in certain metropolitan areas within California, Nevada and Florida and appear to be concentrated in industries related to real estate or where the business owner may be experiencing difficulty with a home loan. Similar to our credit card portfolios, we continued to tighten our underwriting standards, including reducing line limits where appropriate. Our remaining commercial and commercial real estate portfolios continued to produce good credit performance.", "While losses have increased from historical lows, they were still below average. Losses in commercial lending are lumpy by nature, but we continued to benefit from our focus on deep and long term relationships. At the end of first quarter, we had approximately $6 billion in residential one to four family construction and land development loans, which was only about 1.5% of total loans. While losses in this portfolio increased due to the decline in the residential real estate market, losses remained minimal because we maintained our credit discipline during the boom times of the real estate market.", "Our commercial real estate management team has been together for over 20 years. They have successfully managed our commercial real estate portfolio through numerous cycles and their experience is invaluable. With the additional $500 million of loan loss provision above charge offs this quarter, our allowance for credit losses was $6 billion, up from $4 billion a year ago. We believe the allowance was adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio at March 31, 2008.", "In summary, credit losses continued to increase in the home equity and small business portfolios, losses in other portfolios also increased but at a much more moderate rate and within expectations. Just as we have continued to tighten our new customer underwriting where we feel it is important to do so, we continue to actively manage our portfolio of existing relationships for long-term value. We work closely with our existing customers and adjust accounts as needed through line size, pricing, frequency of customer service outreach, and general terms and conditions.", "It is always important to remember, that even in challenging times, the vast majority of our customers are paying on time and performing very well. Of course, any actions we take must strike a balance between reducing risk and maintaining long term relationships.", "We continued to have a strong capital position with shareholders equity of $48 billion at March 31, up $2.1 billion from a year ago. Our leverage, tier I capital, and total capital ratios were 7.04%, 7.87%, and 10.95% respectively, all up from year end levels even with our very strong asset growth. During the first quarter we issued $1.6 billion of tax deductible capital securities. This was the largest retail hybrid we have ever issued, at one of the lowest spreads among recent capital securities issued by other financial institutions, reflecting the strong demand for Wells Fargo securities despite difficult market conditions.", "To summarize, first quarter results clearly reflected the underlying strength of the Wells Fargo franchise and our ability to grow profitably during challenging markets. During a quarter with weak financial and housing markets, we achieved double digit revenue and loan growth. While many of our competitors struggled, our strong capital and financial strength enabled us to add lower risk assets at better prices and increase wallet and market share to drive our future growth.", "Thank you for listening.

In this call we will make forward-looking statements about specific income statement and balance sheet items and other measures of future results of operations and financial conditions, including statements about future credit quality and losses generally, and specifically that we expect higher losses in the home equity portfolio until home prices stabilize, that we believe we can mitigate losses by working with customers who are experiencing financial stress, and that, based on the current interest rate environment, most of our adjustable rate mortgages at Wells Fargo Financial scheduled to reset during the remainder of 2008 will reset at or below their current rate.", "Forward-looking statements give our expectations about the future. They're not guarantees and results may differ from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date. For a discussion of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to our SEC filings, including the 8K filed today, which includes the press release announcing our second quarter results, and to our most recent annual report on Form 10K and quarterly report on Form 10Q, filed with the SEC and to the information incorporated into those documents.", "Now I will turn the review over to our Chief Financial Officer, Howard Atkins.", "Howard Atkins", "Wells Fargo earned a $1.8 billion profit or $0.53 a share in the second quarter. Our credit-related expenses, including a $1.5 billion credit reserve build, were $3 billion in the quarter, up $2.3 billion from a year ago. But nevertheless, we continued to grow our company profitability at a time when many of our peers are losing money and shrinking, we continued to shift our asset portfolio toward lower-risk, higher risk-adjusted return business and, even with 15% annualized linked-quarter growth in earning assets, we increased our capital ratios.", "Here are some of the metrics that highlight the profitable growth we've achieved year over year and the further strengthening of our balance sheet this quarter:  pre-tax pre-provision income up 34%; total revenue up 16%; average earning assets up 20%; average loans up 18%, with consumer loans up 13% and commercial loans up 27percent; fee income up 10%, reflecting continued growth in cross-sell; record retail cross-sell of 5.64 products and record commercial cross-sell of 6.3 products; net retail checking accounts up 5.5%; mortgage servicing of $1.5 trillion, up 7%; mortgage originations of $63 billion and new mortgage applications of $100 billion, almost entirely in agency conforming and government guaranteed mortgages; Wells Trade assets under management up 8%; positive operating leverage, with expenses up only 2% versus 16% revenue growth, resulting in a 51% efficiency ratio; net interest margin of 4.92%, up 23 basis points in the quarter; net interest income up $1.8 billion year-to-date from the first half of 2007, largely offsetting the increase in net charge-offs for the same period even after adjusting charge-offs for the impact of our National Home Equity Group's new charge-off policy; reserves to total loans of 1.88%, the highest this ratio has been in five years; and Tier 1 capital of 8.24%, up 32 basis points in the quarter and up 65 basis points since the year end, reflecting our 14.6% rate of internal capital generation, among the highest in the industry, as well as two successful nondilutive capital raises since the year end 2007;", "And finally, Tier 1 capital plus allowance for loan loss equal to 9.7% of average earning assets, up 87 basis points from year end. The growth, profitability and balance sheet strength reflects the benefits of our diversified business model as well as the unprecedented opportunities the credit crisis itself has created to add attractive assets at wide spreads, to add new customers, and to add market and wallet share. In Wells Fargo's case, the benefit of the credit crisis in terms of higher assets at higher spreads has so far largely offset the negative impact of higher charge-offs. We believe we are one of the few banks that have the capacity to take advantage of such opportunities.", "We announced today that the Wells Fargo Board of Directors increased the quarterly common stock dividend by $0.03 to $0.34 per share, an increase of 10% from the previous quarterly dividend. This is the 21st consecutive year that Wells Fargo has increased its common stock dividend.", "Let me now describe in more detail the business growth we achieved this quarter, and I'll end with a review of credit quality and capital management.", "First, the Commercial business, our Wholesale and Commercial Banking Group, which serves primarily middle market customers and select niches in the large corporate market, and double-digit loan and deposit growth. Revenue grew $191 million or 8% from the second quarter of 2007. Businesses that generated strong revenue growth included lending businesses, deposit services, foreign exchange, institutional brokerage, financial products and insurance. Commercial real estate brokerage fees and capital markets revenue declined from an exceptionally high level a year ago.", "During these uncertain times, Wells Fargo is viewed as a consistent and reliable source for financial advice and products by our commercial customers. Our long-term focus on doing the right thing for our customers has resulted in our ability to earn more of our customers' business and add new customer relationships. This success was reflected in second quarter's record cross-sell of 6.3 products per wholesale relationship and 7.8 products per middle market commercial banking relationships, and we continued to grow fee income during the quarter.", "Wholesale Banking's average loans increased 32% from the second quarter of 2007 as we gained more loan business from our customers, added more loan production offices in select cities around the country, and added new customers directly or through opportunistic, attractively priced acquisitions such as the CIT Construction portfolio and a portfolio purchased by Foothill.", "Loan growth was broad-based across many of our Commercial businesses, including double-digit growth in asset-based lending, middle market lending, international, commercial real estate, and specialized financial services, which includes our capital markets activities and relationships with Fortune 500 companies. We saw an increase in loan spreads for new business across many of our Commercial lending products.", "Within Wholesale Banking, the Commercial Real Estate Group had $29.5 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at quarter end, up 9% from the first quarter. The disruption in the capital markets makes Wells Fargo a reliable source of funding for our existing and high-quality new customers. This growth was diversified by property type, with the largest concentration in office buildings - 28% of new loans.", "This portfolio is geographically diverse, with commercial real estate lending originated through offices nationwide. The commercial real estate loans we added to our portfolio were at better spreads with stronger covenants and largely with customers we have done business with over many years and many cycles.", "Wholesale's average core deposits were up $8 billion or 14% from second quarter of 2007. This growth came primarily from our relationships with large corporate, middle market and correspondent banking customers.", "Our Asset-Based Lending business continued to grow during these challenging economic times. We have been in this business almost four decades, and we are one of the nation's largest asset-based lenders. This is a business that's been successful through a variety of business cycles. Loans grew $5.4 billion, up 34%, and revenue grew 21% from a year ago. During the quarter, Wells Fargo Foothill acquired 80 loans with approximately $1 billion outstanding from a national competitor. Foothill had an existing lending relationship with 59 of these customers, a great example of how we have been able to grow quality assets with both new and existing customers in this environment.", "Our International Group also had double-digit revenue growth. Foreign exchange revenue was up 28% from the second quarter of 2007 and quarterly sales were up 32% from a year ago. This increase in foreign exchange sales is due to the fact that many of our middle market commercial customers require currency transactions as a result of their increased exports and increased hedging needs as well as the increased demand by our customers for international investments as an alternative asset class. Foreign exchange revenue growth through our International teller sites located in our banking stores increased 44% from a year ago. Despite a weak dollar, Wells Fargo customers continue to travel overseas, with bank note revenue up 53% from the second quarter of 2007.", "The Insurance Services Group had another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Our Consumer and Small Business Insurance Group grew revenue by 12% from the second quarter of 2007, driven by sales of identity theft protection, debt cancellation and crop insurance products.", "Crop insurance continued to benefit from high commodity products. Our analysis of the recent Midwest flooding currently indicates that damage was not as widespread as it first appeared, nor was it concentrated in counties and states where we had significant exposure. Therefore, no special provisioning was required in the second quarter; however we will continue to monitor crop conditions throughout the growing season.", "It is important to remember that the vast majority of our risk is borne by third parties, including reinsurers and government agencies. Our middle market commercial insurance company achieved 27% revenue growth, adding 13 new insurance brokerage businesses across the country over the past year.", "Wells Fargo Financial Products Group helps our customers manage their exposure to commodity prices, equities, credit, interest rates and currencies, and creates customized commodity, interest rates, equity, credit and currency solutions for customers who want to add tailored investment alternatives to their portfolio.", "The continued volatility in interest rates and credit and equity markets in the second quarter created opportunities for our Financial Products Group to expand customer sales and earn higher spreads, more than doubling revenue from a year ago. While equity capital gains declined from a year ago, equity and commodity trading areas and customer derivative sales were all very strong this quarter. Our institutional brokerage company produced record sales of fixed income products.", "Wholesale Banking continues to invest in better distribution to meet our customers' needs. We are the only provider of browser-based mobile banking for commercial customers, and we've added wire transfer services and image-positive pay functionality to the CEO Mobile service. CEO Mobile is a streamlined mobile optimized version of the Commercial Electronic Office portal. We added this functionality because our customers told us they wanted to handle wires and check exceptions without being at their desks.", "During the past year, Wholesale Banking added 26 offices across 16 states. Acquisitions over the past year included CIT Construction, ABD Insurance, as part of the Greater Bay Bancorp transaction, insurance premium finance company Flatiron Credit Company, and Transcap Associates, Inc., a factoring and trade finance business. These acquisitions expanded our capabilities and give us further opportunities to better serve our customers.", "Let me now shift to the Community Bank. The Community Banking Group, including regional banking, wealth management, home equity, mortgage banking and retail Internet had double-digit revenue growth, up 22% from the second quarter of 2007, driven by 17% earning asset growth and 16% fee income growth in retail banking and mortgage.", "Net income declined $268 million from a year ago, reflecting a pre-tax credit reserve build of $1.1 billion. Core product sales, what we call solutions, were $5.7 million in the second quarter, up 18% from the second quarter of 2007. California continued to be one of our fastest-growing states, with a 21% increase in core product sales from a year ago.", "Sales growth continued to be driven by improved customer service, higher sales force productivity and new product development. We continued to add more salespeople with platform banker FTE up 8% from a year ago, while sales grew at more than twice that rate. In the second quarter, core sales per platform banker FTE, a key measure of our productivity, were 5.24 per day, up from 4.78 per day a year ago, a 10% increase.", "Once again, regional banking achieved record cross-sell. Our average retail bank household had 5.64 products with Wells Fargo, up from 5.4 products a year ago and up from around 3 products 10 years ago. Twenty-three percent of our retail bank households had over 8 products with us - our long-term goal - nearly double the amount of households who bought 8 products five years ago. In our top region, 32% of our retail bank households had over 8 products with us.", "We have had strong growth and better customer penetration across many product lines, including Wells Fargo packages which include a checking account and at least three other products, such as a debit card, credit card or savings account. Package sales were up 33% from the second quarter of 2007, purchased by 72% of new checking account customers and up from 66% a year ago.", "Total card fees, including credit and debit cards, were up 14% from the second quarter of 2007 as we earned more of our customers' business. Thirty-eight percent of our Retail Bank consumer households had a Wells Fargo credit card, up from 36% a year ago and up from 27% five years ago. Purchase volume on consumer credit cards was up 13% from the second quarter of 2007. Ninety-one percent of our consumer checking account customers had a debit card, up from 86% five years ago. Debit card purchase volume growth slowed in the second quarter, up 3%.", "Consumer checking accounts were up a net 5.5%, the highest growth in over three years, and small business checking accounts up a net 2.4% from last year. California continued to be one of our fastest-growing markets, with consumer checking accounts up a net 6.7%. This was the 12th consecutive quarter where net new accounts in California exceeded the average across our 23 Community Banking states. Texas also had strong growth, with consumer checking accounts up a net 6%.", "While deposit pricing in many of our markets remain competitive, we continue to be disciplined in deposit pricing, with the average rate on our interest-bearing core deposits declining 86 basis points from the first quarter. Our short-term CD rates in particular have been less aggressive than many of our peers. On the other hand, the steepened yield curve has allowed us to attract longer-term deposits from retail customers at attractive rates. Our highest-yielding CDs are at maturities greater than 12 months for the first time in eight quarters. Average retail core deposits, which exclude wholesale banking and mortgage escrow deposits, were up 5% from a year ago and 4% annualized on a linked-quarter basis.", "We continue to increase the number of small business customers we serve and to better serve our existing customers with store-based business solutions, which were up 18% from the second quarter of 2007. Sales of Wells Fargo Business Services packages, which include a business checking account and at least three other business products, such as a business debit card, credit card or a business loan or a line of credit, were up 31% from the second quarter of 2007 and were purchased by 48% of new business checking account customers. Loans to small businesses, loans primarily less than $100,000 on our business direct platform, grew 10% from the second quarter of 2007. Business banking household cross-sell was 3.6 products, up from 3.5 products a year ago on a comparable basis.", "Our Wealth Management Group achieved record results, with revenue up 13% and net income up 29% from second quarter 2007. These strong results were driven by double-digit loan and deposit growth. Private banking, servicing our highest net worth customers, was the group's fastest-growing segment. Private banking revenue increased over 50% from a year ago and net income grew 85%, driven by very strong deposit and loan growth. This shows we're seen as a premiere provider of financial services, enabling us to gain more of our customers' business and attract new high net worth customers.", "Wells Trade, our online brokerage service, had double-digit revenue and net income growth and continued to attract and retain customers, with account levels up 14%. Wells Trade assets under management grew 8% from the second quarter of 2007; strong growth considering the S&P 500 dropped 15% during the first half of 2008.", "Internet sales are an important channel for overall sales growth, with core consumer product sales up 16% from the second quarter of 2007. We had 11 million active online consumers, up 14% from a year ago. Sixty-seven percent of all Wells Fargo consumer checking accounts are online. We now have over 1 million active online small business customers, up 20% from a year ago. Core small business product sales were up 44% from a year ago, driven by strong growth in deposit products.", "We opened 19 banking stores during the second quarter, and we are now serving our retail customers through our 3,330 stores in 23 states. We welcome the customers and team members from United Bancorporation of Wyoming, a banking acquisition we completed on July 1st. We are now the largest bank in Wyoming. Through acquisitions and internal growth, we added a total of 350,000 net new retail bank households from a year ago, with 219,000 added since December 31, 2007. We also added 26 webATM machines, brining our network total to 6,950, and we converted 24 to Envelope-Free webATM machines.", "The housing market slowdown and home price depreciation continued to significantly affect many mortgage companies in the second quarter, but our mortgage business continued to benefit from its premiere reputation and leadership position in the industry, resulting in a high level of originations of high-quality products at improved margins.", "Mortgage banking non-interest income was $1.2 billion in the second quarter, up $566 million from the first quarter and up $508 million from a year ago. While total retail mortgage originations were basically flat from a year ago at $31 billion, our origination of conventional, conforming and government guaranteed mortgages increased 40% from a year ago and represented 95% of our total home mortgage originations, up from 60% of originations a year ago. Total originations, including both retail and third-party channels, of $63 billion were down 22% as we intentionally pulled back our third-party mortgage and home equity originations over the past year.", "The fact that originations have remained relatively strong from a year ago while we've continued to tighten our pricing and underwriting standards demonstrates the opportunity we're realizing in the marketplace to add high-quality business and top producers during a period when many mortgage companies have decreased their capacity or exited the business entirely.", "Mortgage applications were down from last quarter and a year ago, but still a very high $100 billion. Forty-four percent of these applications were for refinancing, down from 62% in the first quarter. The volume in purchase applications increased to $56 billion in the second quarter, up from $50 billion in the first quarter but down from $68 billion in the second quarter of 2007. We ended the second quarter with an unclosed pipeline of $47 billion.", "The $566 million linked-quarter increase in mortgage non-interest income reflected a $609 million increase in net gains on mortgage loan originations and sales activities and a $52 million decline in servicing income. The $609 million net gain on origination sales activities reflected wider margins, lower levels of additions to the repurchase reserve, lower write downs of repurchased mortgage loans, an increase in the value of commercial mortgages held for sale, and an increase in the servicing value of the mortgage warehouse and pipeline. These improvements were largely driven by higher interest rates and more stable liquidity in the mortgage market.", "The decline in servicing income reflected a loss of $65 million that consisted of just over $4.1 billion increase in the fair value of MSRs, offset by a corresponding $4.2 billion loss in the value of the economic hedge. The increase in the fair value of MSRs and the decline in the value of hedges were influenced by a 50 basis point increase in mortgage market rates and the resulting deceleration in prepayment speeds and the movement of a large portion of the servicing portfolio to being out of the money for refinancing. This was partially reflected in the drop in refinancing activity in our mortgage applications this past quarter.", "At the end of the quarter the ratio of capitalized MSRs to total mortgage loans serviced for others was 1.37% compared with 1.42% a year ago and 1.08% at the end of the first quarter. Some of the increase in this ratio is mix related since our servicing portfolio now has a lower percentage of ARMs, more FHA mortgages, and less jumbo mortgages. Our owned servicing portfolio grew 7% from a year ago. That's somewhat slower growth than prior periods as we continue to reduce third-party originations and purchase substantially less subprime and Alt-A servicing rights. Over 90% of the mortgage loans we service are for prime customers.", "Reflecting the continued stress on the housing market, the foreclosure rate continued to increase to 1.06% at quarter end, which we believe was still better than the industry average. We continue to work closely with our customers to keep them in their homes. We have invested significant resources into proactively contacting and working with borrowers on casebycase solutions that align with their individual needs and that respect the important role investors play in this process.", "The homeowner's willingness to work with us is crucial to our success in keeping people in their homes. We conducted a study of servicing customers who were up to 60 or more days past due on their loans and not in foreclosure or bankruptcy and found that of every 10 of these borrowers, 7 worked with Wells Fargo and reached a solution, 2 declined our help, and the remainder were either unreachable or a solution could not be found.", "Let me now shift to credit quality. Overall credit quality deteriorated in the second quarter. Net charge-offs in the second quarter were $1.5 billion or 1.55% of average loans annualized. As previously disclosed, beginning in the second quarter we changed our home equity charge-off policy from 120 days to no more than 180 days, consistent with FFIEC guidelines. The impact of this change deferred approximately $265 million in home equity charge-offs from the second quarter, although the change in policy did not reduce second quarter provision expense, which included the deferred charge-offs.", "To illustrate the performance of the different parts of our $399 billion loan portfolio, let me review the segments in detail.", "The deterioration in the overall loan portfolio largely occurred in the second lien home equity portfolio, which represented about 19% of the total $399 billion in loans outstanding. At quarter end we had approximately $84 billion in home equity loans managed by our National Home Equity Group, of which about $12 billion were in the first lien position.", "Second quarter losses in the total home equity portfolio were $342 million, which, as indicated, was approximately $265 million lower than it would have been because of the change we made in our home equity charge-off policy. Of the $342 million in loss, $97 million was in the liquidating home equity portfolio, loans primarily sourced through third parties. The remaining loss of $245 million was in the core home equity portfolio, about 98% of which was sourced directly through our retail system.", "Loans originated through our retail system have performed significantly better than the loans originated through third parties. In terms of financial risk, the principle distinction between the liquidating and the core portfolios is that, due to the continued decline in home prices, 71% of the smaller, liquidating portfolio had a combined loantovalue of greater than 90% at quarter end based predominantly on estimated home values from March 2008, automated valuation models, and May 2008 home price indices, whereas 38% of the core portfolio had updated combined loantovalues above 90%.", "Until home prices stabilize we expect higher losses in the home equity portfolio. It is important to remember that most of our home equity borrowers are current with their loans. Only about 2% of the accounts are two or more payments past due at quarter end.", "We are working diligently but aggressively with our customers to avoid problems and mitigate loss. The change in home equity charge-off policy this quarter was made to provide additional time to work with those customers who may be experiencing financial stress but have the potential to resolve their difficulty. During the second quarter, that change in policy benefited nearly 900 customers, with approximately $90 million in balances. By working with these customers and finding solutions to their financial difficulties, we believe we will end up keeping more customers in their homes and mitigating loss.", "In addition to exiting most indirect home equity origination channels last year, we have been managing accounts to reduce risk while at the same time remaining open for business to our creditworthy retail customers. As a result of our active account management and tightening of credit for new originations, total home equity outstandings were flat this quarter. The liquidating home equity portfolio is down about $800 million or 7% from year end.", "The $75 billion first mortgage portfolio experienced slight deterioration, but losses remained relatively low. Second quarter annualized charge-offs were 0.53% with $97 million in total losses, up slightly from $75 million in the first quarter. The relatively low loss rate in our total first mortgage portfolio largely reflected the fact that we never offered option ARMs or negative amortizing products as well as the conservative underwriting in mortgage products we have traditionally held in the portfolio.", "Our first mortgage portfolio consisted of $25 billion of real estate secured loans held at Wells Fargo Financial, $12 billion of home equity loans in the first mortgage position, mostly retail originated, and $38 billion of mostly prime, customer relationship-based first mortgages held at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, regional banking, or our Wealth Management Group.", "As we continued to tighten our underwriting standards in the second quarter, the growth in this portfolio slowed, up only 2% from the first quarter. We continued to adjust our maximum LTVs based on local market conditions, enhanced our income documentation standards, and further adjusted our risk-based pricing as we continued to strengthen our new origination requirements and loan quality.", "Within the first mortgage portfolio, Wells Fargo Financial had a total of $25 billion of debt consolidation loans originated through Financial's U.S. retail stores at quarter end. Because of the decline in real estate values and active account management, debt consolidation loan growth has continued to slow, with the portfolio up only 2% from the first quarter compared with a 15% increase from second quarter 2007. Ninety-six percent of the $25 billion debt consolidation portfolio was in a first lien position.", "Wells Fargo Financial team members who originate these loans underwrite to the customer first and the collateral second. This portfolio does not include interest only, stated income, option ARM or negative amortizing loans. New real estate customers primarily come from outbound calling to customers with a Wells Fargo relationship where we can clearly demonstrate a tangible benefit for our customers by improving their financial situations through debt consolidation.", "We conservatively underwrite these loans with full documentation and require income verification. Sixty-two percent of this portfolio had a FICO score above 620. The average LTV was 78%. The average loan size was $132,000. Approximately 53% of the portfolio was fixed-rate loans. The remaining loans were 327 adjustable rate mortgages with a fixed payment for the first three years of the loan. These loans were underwritten to a fully indexed rate and do not contain teaser rates.", "Based on the current interest rate environment, starting in the second quarter most of our adjustable rate mortgages that reset throughout the rest of 2008 will reset at the same rate or below their current rate, which will actually reduce customer monthly payments. Like other real estate secured portfolios, delinquencies and charge-offs have increased due to the weak housing market. Second quarter losses were $48 million or a 0.76% annualized loss rate. The credit performance for this portfolio has continued to perform significantly better than published industry rates for nonprime mortgage portfolios.", "The size of Wells Fargo Financial's $27 billion auto portfolio declined 14% annualized from last quarter and 12% from last year, reflecting a tightening of account acquisition strategies to reduce loan volume in higher-risk tiers and tiers with unacceptable returns. Credit losses declined $47 million from the first quarter, in part seasonal, and included only $23 million over second quarter 2007. Losses in this portfolio totaled $242 million or about 16% of Wells Fargo's overall quarterly losses.", "Total delinquencies increased 16% and 90 days past due and still accruing increased 22% on a linked-quarter basis due to the weakness in the overall economy and seasoning of the portfolio. Delinquencies were flat and 90 days past due were up 11% from the second quarter of 2007. Approximately 50% of the portfolio was for cars or vans, with the other 50% for trucks and SUVS, and just under one-third was for the purchase of new vehicles. Almost 75% of the auto portfolio had a FICO above 620. We are pleased with the improved performance of the auto portfolio under a new management team, new collections and underwriting systems installed a year ago, and tighter underwriting and pricing.", "We announced this month that we are exiting the auto leasing business. About 10% of the auto portfolio and about 6% of year-to-date originations were from the lease business.", "Our $13 billion Community Banking credit card portfolio is a relationship product primarily offered to our Wells Fargo customers within our banking states. Credit losses have increased from historically low levels as the result of higher bankruptcy rates, seasoning of the portfolio, and continuing economic pressure on consumers, but they remained within our profit model expectations and historical industry norms.", "We continue to tighten our underwriting standards, which reduced new account growth but increased the quality of our new customers. We proactively manage our existing accounts, including placing accounts in nonexpansion queues, lowering and in some cases closing credit lines, and for a small percentage of accounts, repricing them consistent with the customer's current risk profile. Since the vast majority of our bank card customers have other relationships with Wells Fargo, we monitor customer behavior using both internal and external measurements.", "Wells Fargo Financial has a $7.4 billion credit card portfolio, flat for the first quarter. These cards are primarily sold to Wells Fargo Financial customers and through retailers and manufacturers with large dealer networks, not through mass mailing campaigns. Financial's card portfolio consisted of three different portfolios - $2.7 billion in standard credit cards sold to Wells Fargo customers, $2.8 billion in our retailer portfolio, which is a private label card similar to sales finance, and $1.4 billion in cash on demand, which looks like a credit card but can only be used at an ATM, not at a merchant.", "Losses in Wells Fargo Financial's card portfolio increased $18 million from the first quarter; however we have made significant investments in default management, continue to tighten underwriting standards, and appropriately price for risk. The net interest spread on total credit cards is positive, even with the higher loss rates in this portfolio, so growth in this portfolio added to earnings even as dollar losses increased in the second quarter.", "Within our $168 billion commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio, we have an $11.8 billion business direct portfolio consisting primarily of unsecured small loans and lines of credit to small business owners nationwide with an average balance of less than $20,000. Business direct losses, which were up about $30 million linked quarter, showed signs of stabilizing near the end of the second quarter as a result of almost 18 months of tightened underwriting and account management activities targeted at reducing exposure to the highest risk accounts. However, losses in this portfolio, as in all of our loan portfolios, will obviously be impacted by how the overall economy performs.", "Our remaining commercial and commercial real estate portfolios continue to produce good credit performance. While losses have increased from historical lows, they were still below historical averages. Losses in commercial lending are lumpy by nature, but we continue to benefit from our focus on deep and long-term relationships.", "At the end of the second quarter we had approximately $6 billion in residential one-to-four family construction and land development loans, which was only 1.5% of total loans. While losses in this portfolio increased due to the decline in the residential real estate market, losses remained acceptable because of the quality and experience of our people and customers, and we continue to maintain a high level of discipline in our credit underwriting standards across our commercial and residential real estate businesses.", "Total nonperforming assets were $5.2 billion or 1.31% of loans in the second quarter compared with $4.5 billion or 1.16% of loans in the first quarter. The majority of the increase in nonperforming assets was concentrated in portfolios affected by residential real estate. The nonperforming loan increase was affected by our strategies to reduce losses in home mortgage, home equity and Wells Fargo Financial. We work hard at keeping our customers in their homes and have increased the number of loan modifications. Accounting rules require us to classify these restructured loans as nonperforming until the customer demonstrates the ability to make payments under the revised terms. We require six monthly payments before returning the loan to accrual status.", "The home equity charge-off policy change also contributed to the increase in nonperforming loans as fewer loans were charged off this quarter. Due to market conditions, we continue to hold more foreclosed properties than we have historically. Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, excluding insured and guaranteed Ginnie Mae and similar loan balances, increased by $150 million from the first quarter. The increase this quarter in real estate construction was due to matured loans to a few homebuilders with whom we are working on restructuring.", "With the additional $1.5 billion of loan loss provision above charge-offs this quarter, our allowance for credit losses was $7.5 billion, nearly double the $4 billion allowance a year ago. At quarter end, our allowance as a percent of total loans was 1.88%. We believe this allowance is adequate for losses inherent in the portfolio at June 30, 2008.", "Let me conclude with a few final comments about our balance sheet. During the last year we've added approximately $20 billion to our available for sale securities portfolio. The $91 billion portfolio at quarter end was largely comprised of agency mortgage-backed securities, private CMOs, which were mostly AAA rated, and smaller amounts of hybrid preferreds and other securities. The securities that have been purchased during the past year were purchased and are being held for their attractive long-term yields.", "Stockholders' equity was $48 billion at June 30, up $757 million from a year ago even though we provided $3.4 billion in excess of net charge-offs over the last three quarters. Our leverage Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios were 7.35%, 8.24% and 11.23%, respectively, all up from year end and the first quarter levels even with our very strong loan and securities portfolio growth.", "During the second quarter we issued a $2.5 billion tax-deductible hybrid capital security. The security had the lowest coupon for a Fed Tier 1 eligible capital security issued in 2008 and was nearly four times oversubscribed, reflecting the continued strong demand for Wells Fargo securities in the capital markets. Unlike many large bank peers, we have additional capacity to issue non-dilutive capital.", "In summary, second quarter results demonstrate the diversity and strength of Wells Fargo's business model and our ability to continue to grow and invest in our franchise. While we continue to tighten our underwriting standards and price for risk, the asset and customer growth we achieved this quarter demonstrates that Wells Fargo continue to be viewed by our existing and new customers as a strong and reliable provider of financial services. While the credit crisis has resulted in higher charge-offs, the impact of these charge-offs has so far largely been offset by the benefit of higher assets at wider spreads, in part created by the credit crisis itself.", "Thank you for listening.

My name is Regina and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Wachovia Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, July 22, 2008.", "I would now like to introduce Ms. Alice Lehman, Director of Wachovia Investor Relations. Ms. Lehman, you may begin your conference.", "Alice Lehman - Director of Wachovia Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator and thanks to everyone out there for joining our call this morning. We hope you have received our earnings release by now as well as the slides we will be using in today's presentation and our supplemental quarterly earnings report. If you haven't, all of these documents are available on our Investor Relations website at wachovia.com/investor.", "In this call we will review the first 28 pages of the slide presentation package. In addition to this teleconference, this call is available through a listen-only live audio webcast. Replays of the teleconference will be available by about one o'clock today and will continue through 5 PM, Friday, October 17. The replay phone number is 706-645-9291, the access code is 49418191.", "Our CEO, Bob Steel, will kick things off. He will be followed by CFO, Tom Wurtz, and our Chief Risk Officer, Don Truslow. Also with us are, our Chairman, Lanty Smith and other members of our executive management team, all of whom are here to answer your questions as well. We will be happy to take your questions at the end. Of course, before we begin I have a few reminders.", "First, any forward-looking statements made during this call are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that could cause Wachovia's results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements are set forth in Wachovia's public reports filed with the SEC, including Wachovia's current report on Form 8-K filed today. Second, some of the discussion about our company's performance today will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information that reconciles those measures to GAAP measures can be found in our filings with the SEC and in the news release and the supplemental material located at wachovia.com/investor. And finally, when you do ask questions, please give your name and your firm's name.", "Now, let me turn this over to Bob Steel.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thank you Alice, and thank all of you for joining. This is an important call for Wachovia and we appreciate your attention. As Alice said, the call this morning will really be in three parts. After some introductory comments by me, Tom Wurtz will talk about the facts and the financials, then Don Truslow will talk about some challenges in our credit area and what we think are very realistic assumptions for dealing with this and our strategy. And then lastly, I'll return to make some concluding comments about capital and liquidity. And thank you for your attention. As Alice said too, we have business leaders with us here in the room today. So should your questions be best answered by one of them, we will introduce them and they can speak more specifically to the issues.", "Now let me began by introductory comments and reference you should you be looking at the deck to page 1. Basically, the facts are outlined on this first page. There were GAAP losses of $8.9 billion, including a $4.2 billion credit reserve billed that we have previously announced, as well as the goodwill impairment we'd also [inaudible] for you earlier which totaled $6.1 billion. Excluding the goodwill impairment, we had an operating loss of about $2.7 billion, consistent with what we had announced previously on July 9.", "And excluding about $9 billion of what we are calling \"Notable items\", we generated $4 billion in pre-tax pre-provision results. This is a very important fact to us at Wachovia. The core franchises of our company are strong and in some cases getting stronger and our goal is to make them the strongest. But let me stop, our reported results today are clearly a disappointing performance for which we take responsibility. We are serious about getting on top of these issues quickly and we believe we have a good grasp of the challenges facing the economy, the industry and Wachovia.", "Today, we're going to discuss decisive steps that we believe we're taking to generate, protect, and preserve capital through first, a reduction in the quarterly dividend to $0.05 per common share and with the dividend reduction, and the other organic levers we have to rebuild capital, we estimate that we'll preserve or free up more than $5 billion of capital. And we look forward to discussing all of these different issues with you today.", "In addition to freeing up capital, we are also doing our best to remove significant credit risk by exiting the General Bank's wholesale mortgage origination channel immediately. Previously announced, we had ceased originating the negative am [ph] Pick-A-Pay mortgages, and we are working with our borrowers to assist them in avoiding foreclosures.", "We'll go over this in more detail in the following presentation. So now, let me turn this over to CFO Tom Wurtz for the details on the second quarter and then he will be followed as I said by Chief Risk Officer, Don Truslow to provide a deep dive on the characteristics of the portfolio, the reserve build, and particularly our view regarding stress portfolios because we are committed to increase transparency with regard to all issues of credit risk. And then I will return to cover the capital actions announced today in more detail, and then look forward to your questions.", "Our bottom line thoughts on this performance is their earnings engine remains intact, core businesses are strong and positioned attractively, we have done our very best to be more cautious and develop a realistic approach regarding our credit reserves in light of the severe decline in housing markets. And also our other portfolios are performing better than the industry. Clearly, challenges remain as the economy grows.", "We feel Wachovia is on exceptional strong footing, and let me turn it over to Tom.", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Bob and good morning to everyone. I'd ask you to turn to page two and you can see the headline is the GAAP loss of $8.9 billion, and that corresponds to an operating loss of about $2.7 billion in the quarter. And just a reminder, all of you are well aware that the goodwill impairment is $6.1 billion is non-cash and capital neutral. One of the highlights for the quarter would be strong net interest income growth, you have seen a lot of that across the industry.", "We had expected it to be up strongly and absent the impact of a $975 million SILO charge that we've previously disclosed, net interest income was up 11% on a linked quarter basis. That was driven both by balance sheet growth and a nice improvement in the margin up 23 basis points before the impact of the SILO charge.", "Earning assets and low-cost core deposits were up about 2%, fees up 14%, you will hear more about the strength in the underlying businesses, but we had good performance in service charges, the banking fees, advisory and underwriting, and other income and market disruptions losses were reduced by about $1.4 billion and that is associated with a dramatic reduction in exposures which Don will speak to you later.", "Expenses up on the surface 14%, however excluding in addition to the legal reserve, they are only up about 3%, when you consider both the legal reserves and non-merger severance. And the 3% increase was driven by higher incentives based on higher revenue and annual merit increases.", "Turning to page three, beneath the headline GAAP loss for the quarter, there is a positive story regarding the fundamental underpinning our businesses. This quarter is laden with high-credit costs and a number of notable items, which are net reflective of the longer-term earnings potential of the company. This table is intended to help illustrate this point. We start with the pre-tax loss of $10.4 billion and then back up provision expense to get a pre-tax, pre-provision loss of about $4.9 billion.", "Embedded in that loss are five notable items that aggregate to nearly $9 billion of loss. They are, first, the goodwill impairment of $6.06 billion, the SILO charge of $975 million, market disruption losses of $936 million, the billed [ph] legal reserves of $590 million and the impact of discretionary plan sales of securities, which produced a $391 million loss in the quarter. Absent these items results for the quarter are modestly higher than $4 billion, which speaks to the strength of the underlying franchise. Clearly, we can't wish away any of these items and I'm not suggesting that we are collectively not responsible for these outcomes. So, I think it is useful to clear the dust to better understand how the businesses are actually performing.", "While we are on this page, I would like to address the goodwill impairment we recorded in the quarter. We experienced an impairment in three of our reporting sub-segments which totaled $6 billion. Those reporting sub-segments were our corporate investment bank, corporate lending segment, our investment banking segment and in our general bank, our commercial segment. I would suspect that it's not intuitive why we do not have an impairment in the retail and small business segments, which includes Legacy, Golden West business given the radical changes we are making to our lending strategy and the core earnings outlook for the now trading Pick-a-Pay portfolio. As a little bit of background following an acquisition, the assets of the acquired business are contributed to the appropriate reporting segment of the acquirer.", "In this case, the entire Golden West business was contributed to our retail and small business segment. The goodwill associated with Golden West has been homogenized with any pre-existing goodwill in this segment. We've recorded goodwill in the segment from the merger between Wachovia and First Union, the acquisition of South Trust and other miscellaneous small deals over the past two decades.", "Because of the strong organic growth of this segment over the past seven or eight years, its absolute earnings power and the market value of this franchise, it continues to be able to support the full amount of goodwill assigned to this segment and it's quite unlikely this will change.", "The reason for the impairment in the other segments arises from the significant disconnect between our market cap and our book value of equity. When we estimate the fair value of each reporting segment in light of our overall market cap, we are left with the three segments I mentioned earlier where the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the actual goodwill. For the CIB segment, the entire amount of the signed goodwill was written off and in the GBG commercial segment, approximately one-third of the signed goodwill was written off. We provide more detail regarding the methodology for goodwill accounting and a table detailing this on page 50 and 51.", "Turning to page 4, the key points to take away from this page are the Pick-a-Pay portfolio will begin to try [ph] as we have ceased originations, they are accurately working with customers for refinance and other mortgage products.", "Overall growth for the loan portfolio is expected to be down over the remainder of the year as we focus intently on preserving capital for our core customers and reduce credit only relationships both in consumer and wholesale portfolios. It's worth noting no loans were transferred to the loan portfolio from health or sale or trading accounts in the quarter. And, also we are not seeing any unusual line of credit utilization in either of the retail or wholesale portfolio.", "Turning to page 5. We focus on deposits, you see low-cost core deposits at 2% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year, we saw a nice increase in our suite product, strong commercial and treasury  services sales, and solid checking acquisition with 263,000 net new accounts in the quarter. We also continue to enjoy a strong response for our Way2Save product and the associated cross-sell of checking accounts. After a few months, we are approaching nearly $0.25 billion in new checking balances associated with that account.", "On the CD front, we staggered originations last year so did not mature in the November to February timeframe where we're doing the branch conversions with Golden West. After those conversions were successfully completed, those CDs that we booked early in 2007 matured, and we allowed  about 8 billion of those balances to run off in the quarter and those are relatively high priced CDs in the low 5% range.", "We then initiated a campaign to raise CDs at the end of June, which has increased balances by about $13 billion. The CDs are spreads that are anywhere from 70 to 90 basis points more attractive on a relative basis than what we allow it to try it over that timeframe. So, as you can see the average cost of CDs has come down appreciably since the end of March, is now stabilizing somewhere in around in the low 370s, and we continue to enjoy a  strong positive growth on the CD portfolio.", "As we turn to page six, this page is simply intended to illustrate the core strength of each  business. You see that on a segment basis, and this is consistent with our historic segment reporting methodology, which excludes merger-related restructuring expense, intangible amortization, goodwill impairment, and reserve build, those things are all held in apparent, you can see the General Bank produced on a segment basis over $1.1 billion of earnings, Wealth Management approximately $100 million, the Corporate and Investment Bank about $200 million, and Capital Management about $300 million. So good evidence of strength in each business.", "Now, turning to the General Bank on page 7. On the left-hand side you see two tables. One is the conventional view of the General Bank and the second is the General Bank excluding mortgage. And the purpose for that is in general, the General Bank is doing extraordinarily well in a relatively difficult environment, and the impact of mortgage has a pretty pronounced impact on the results. So, if I can direct you to the bottom part of the page excluding mortgage, what you would see is that our segment earnings basis excluding mortgage, it was up 6% on a linked-quarter basis, down 4% year-over-year with the drivers of that reduction being higher credit costs across other portfolios in the General Bank and mostly higher expenses reflecting western expansion and continued de novo expansion.", "Looking at the General Bank including mortgage, what you see is down 6% on a linked basis, down 23% on a year-over-year basis almost all attributable to the impact of higher credit costs in the mortgage portfolio. But underneath this, you see strong evidence of good solid momentum in the company, you see fees up 2%, card volume up 10%, mortgage banking fees up. Obviously, we have been very focused on expense management. You see that 53% of the expense increase is driven by a higher credit related expenses, REO disposition and management and 17% by growth initiatives so, relatively modest core expense growth.", "And salary is up reflecting annual merit increases, FTE is down about 416 employees. Importantly though in this difficult environment, customer satisfaction remains best-in-class. 6.65 on a 7 point scale, strong customer loyalty, customer acquisition remained very robust, our new loss ratio of 1.23. And we also provided some further details on that, our customer acquisition rate is about 15.3% and attrition a low 12.4%. Also in the commercial side, we see customer acquisition up about 28%. And importantly what you'll hear as a resounding theme is that, across our business segments, you're seeing good evidence of synergies between the businesses. Here we highlight one, investment sales up 26% year-over-year.", "Turning to page 8, the Wealth Management team delivered a record performance in the quarter, and that follows several previous records over the last several quarters. You see strength in net interest income, fee is down slightly based on market valuations, up 2% year-over-year as growth in fiduciary and asset management fees offset lower insurance commissions, a good expense management with most of it driven... most of the increase driven by expansion into the West. A record overhead efficiency ratio of 61% for the Wealth Management team, and great client acquisition, with acquisitions up 16% quarter-over-quarter. And again, here if you see the evidence of the strong partnership with record insurance bank cross sell up 51% year-over-year.", "Turning to page 9, the Corporate and Investment Bank. I think highlight here are several fold. One, there has been a significant reduction in exposures that expose us to further market disruption losses, Don will detail that later.", "Second, the actual losses in the quarter were trimmed by about two-thirds from the prior several quarters. And third, they continue to evidence very solid expense control in what I would characterize as generally, a fairly challenging market, you see underlying strength on the origination side with Investment Bank origination fees up 16%, with strong performance in global rates, leverage finance and equities. Principal investing is down appreciably from the prior quarter, which I'd remind you, included the implementation of FAS 157 that produced a relatively significant mark-to-market on that portfolio.", "You have not yet seen all the evidence of the expense discipline in the Corporate Investment Bank. You will see about 400 of the 500 previously announced FTE reductions occurring in the third quarter in associated expense space. Loans up 6% quarter-over-quarter, about a third of that is associated with the first quarter transfers of loans from trading or available-for-sale portfolios and to loan portfolio where the other two-thirds reflects on a strong international trade finance in commercial real estate businesses.", "We expect balance sheet to contract over the second half of 2008 as we are very disciplined on the lending side. And again, here you see evidence of strong internal partnerships with revenue on GBG referrals of investment banking products, up about 14% year-over-year.", "The final major segment I will address is the Capital Management area. And I think here underneath the reported results are some very strong fundamentals. What you see is, net interest income up 10% on strong growth in retail deposits out of the brokerage business. Fees down 9%, reflecting $118 million of market disruption losses and lower asset valuations. Primarily we have $89 million of securities impairments relating to liquidation of an every [ph] refund and then the further mark on assets that were taken out of money market funds since last fall, together those contribute the vast majority of the reduction in revenue in the quarter.", "Commissions were down 2%, driven by lower insurance commissions in our reinsurance business, and fiduciary and asset management fees down 5% quarter-over-quarter on lower market valuations despite retail brokerage managed account. I think the keys that people should take away is that we are about 40% complete with the AG Edwards integration, it is going very well, a good evidence of that would be, we have record Series 7 headcount at this point, we have client assets where we are witnessing positive net inflows, we saw $4.8 billion in the second quarter of positive net inflows, $4 billion of that within managed accounts. And despite the S&P being down 15% since consummation, client assets are only down about 7%. So, again we are doing a great job of attracting very productive brokers, retaining our core brokers and building client assets.", "Evidence of the strong internal partnerships would be reflected in CIB syndicate revenue, about 61% quarter-over-quarter, and General Bank referrals are up strongly with lending up 15% and deposits up 17%. So, all in all, I think there is great reason to be very accomplished that the underlying fundamentals of our business are quite strong, we're serving customers very well.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thanks, Tom. And now what we will do is have Don comment on some of the issues I aligned earlier with regard to credit, and issues in the housing-related and market disruption exposure. Don?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Thanks, Bob. As has been mentioned, credit costs were very significant for the quarter, and credit metrics showed pretty meaningful deterioration throughout the quarter, primarily through the continued slide in the housing market. We continue to confront unprecedented housing price declines in the market, especially in certain markets in California where we've got Golden West concentrations.", "About two-thirds of our credit costs for the quarter were related to Pick-a-Pay portfolio for both building reserves or covering charge-offs. Secondarily, but still housing-related, we continue to work through the challenges presented by the commercial real estate portfolio, tied to the housing market. Outside of those two portfolios, we have seen credit costs increase, but at a pretty manageable pace, and also I'd say, very much in line with what we have been anticipating and talking about for several quarters, and in line with what... I think one might expect to see in this part of the economic cycle and the credit cycle.", "If you flip over to page 12... slide 12, it provides an overview of the credit metrics for the quarter. Again, period-end loans of $488 billion, non-performing assets ended the quarter at about $12 billion, which was up $3.6 billion at the end of the first quarter. 80% of the increase was driven by the Pick-a-Pay non-performs and higher NPAs and real estate loans related to residential properties.", "Pick-a-Pay non-performs were up $2.4 billion, and end of the quarter it was about $7 billion. Of that $7 billion representing nearly 60% of the company's total non-performing loans. The nature of the Pick-a-Pay non-performing balances as we have discussed before, are such that we would expect they will continue to rise given this just fundamentals of the time frame [inaudible] how long it takes to get that property through foreclosure, that's where we can take quite... actually take action. So we have seen the rise in non-performs that we have been talking about for a while. And I would expect that going forward, we will continue to see some of that trend. Commercial real estate residential related NPA is worth about $500 million for the quarter ending at about $1 billion and non-performs in other loan portfolio is generally showed modest increases.", "Provision expense of $5.6 billion includes $1.3 billion in charge-offs that resulted in 110 basis points annualized charge-off rate for the quarter. Breaking that down a little bit, commercial charge-offs totaled $455 million, up $218 million from the first quarter. The charge-offs in the real estate Financial Services Group improved nearly three quarters of this increase. And again, most of that was tied to the residential related segment of commercial real estate.", "Consumer charge-offs for the quarter were $854 million, up $326 million from the end of the first quarter. This increase was driven by a $268 million increase in Pick-a-Pay charge-offs to $508 million or about 60% consumer losses. Provision expenses exceeded charge-offs in the quarter by roughly $4.2 billion resulting in an $11 billion ending  allowance for loan losses which represented about 2.2% of period-end loan.", "The largest portion of the provision which was $3.2 billion was to bill the allowance related to the Pick-A-Pay  portfolio and as we will touch on in just a minute, this action reflects our view of more negative trends in the housing  market since the end of the first quarter and a higher estimation of losses in the portfolio. The ending reserve balance associated with the Pick-A-Pay  portfolio at quarter end was 4.2%.", "You slip over to slide 13 and this provides an overview of the consumer loan portfolio in total and of the $272 billion of consumer loans at quarter end, the Pick-A-Pay portfolio represented about 45% of the total portfolio. Secondly in auto loans represented about 13% and 10% respectively and you will note there is very little unsecured consumer credit in our consumer loan portfolio.", "Non-performing assets totaled $8.4 billion and $7 billion of which we mentioned are tied to our Pick-A-Pay, included in the $7 billion or about $1.5 billion in loans where we have modified the loans to work with borrowers who are experiencing some form of temporary hardship. And our experience has been recently good in this regard and that roughly 50% of these modified loans remain current with their modified terms after about six months of seasoning.", "As I mentioned charge-offs totaled about $854 million, up $326 million from the end of the first quarter. 82% of the increase in charge-offs were increased Pick-A-Pay charge-offs and excluding the increase in Pick-A-Pay losses, all other consumer losses were up a pretty modest $58 million during the quarter, which we feel recently good about. Slide 14 provides a breakout of the consumer mortgage portfolio, which excludes the home equity products. And information concerning the home equity products is contained in the appendix on page 44 and while cost in the home equity products are up, as we have anticipated, we continue to be very pleased with how that portfolio performs relative to other portfolios in the industry.", "The mortgage portfolio here is really shown in three pieces. First we've got the Pick-a-Pay loan portfolio, and as mentioned in the bullet points, we continue to be aggressive in selling foreclosed properties as quickly as practical given the falling housing prices in many of our stress markets, particularly in California. And, during the quarter we sold just under 1,200 properties against an intake of about 1,400 properties.", "Severities linked to moving these properties, which include selling costs rose to an average of about 36% for the quarter, versus 32% for the first quarter. So our severities are up a little bit, it's we're being aggressive in [inaudible] properties. And I will cover our changed view of the outlook for losses on this portfolio in more depth in just a minute.", "Next is the traditional mortgage book, which consists of the legacy Wachovia portfolio. And while we have seen some modest deterioration in this portfolio it now looks quite well against the challenging housing environment with charge-offs up only 3 million from the first quarter to 32 million which represents about 20 basis points.", "Lastly, there is a smaller mortgage book tied to our Corporate and Investment Bank, which represents loans primarily purchased through our key wholesale channel as well as some other purchase loans, and carried as loans held for investments. And most of these loans were either purchased in a discount or mark down if they were moved from held for sale status.", "To drill a little deeper into the additional provision expense during the quarter for the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, you might want to turn to slide 15. This slide outlines our key changes in our outlook. One distinction, we believe in the modeling tool, which we used as a base for forecasting Pick-a-Pay losses, and therefore we use as a backdrop for setting the allowance is that housing price assumptions in our methodology not only drive the estimated severity, but also directly impact our estimated frequency up to fall.", "So basically as housing prices fall and as our assumptions around housing prices are such that we're looking for declining housing prices, the modeling methodology expects that borrowers will have a higher [inaudible] to fall as well as the higher severity of loss. And that makes the modeled output particularly sensitive to our housing price assumption. You can see the portfolio statistics at the end of the second quarter and the housing price scenario we are currently using compared with the scenario used in the first quarter, the change to a more negative outlook versus what we were using in the first quarter, were driven by a couple of things.", "First, driven by what we are experiencing in the market, and I think that has been also reflected by other market commentators as we move through the second quarter. Also influenced by our view that the consumer is now facing tougher economic headwinds, particularly in employment and energy costs, lenders have generally tightened their credit standards further and that has reduced the amount of capital available with potential buyers.  And we still are very concerned about the growing overhang of foreclosed properties in the  market that may continue to press [ph] values.", "Slide 16, all I have made is probably overly busy with data but hopefully it will provide useful information on the 25 MSC in the portfolio that it contributed to about 90% of the Pick-A-Pay losses experienced thus far. So, very quickly just a range to the page, walking across the page, first set of columns are the balances in these 25 markets as of the end of June.  There is aggregation at bottom of the page and the 22 billion combined concentrated in the Central  Valley and Inland Empire have both represented our biggest challenges, and actually have represented a little under 50% of all losses we've taken to date and that's where we are focusing on, much of our retention and activity.", "The second set of columns begins with  the average original loan to value for Pick-A-Pay loans. The next column titled, current, is the actual combined loan to value for our loans using estimated valuations or AVMs, which were updated in May for the collateral  underlying our loans. And then the third column in that set titled, average at trough, approximates the average loan to value at the model trough of the market by MSA for our loans implied by the housing price decline what we have now in our allowance model.", "So, just to back up on average, we began with 71% combined loan to value  for our portfolio. Our current estimates using May AVMs are that average LTV each have gone to about 85% and the implied average LTV at trough, using the assumptions now in the allowance model would be about 99%, and of course the timing of those troughs will be different across these various MSAs.", "The next set of columns indicate the decline in house prices underlying our loan since origination. Again using the May AVM data, for our houses, in aggregate we've seen a decline of about 9% of our house collateral with some markets such as Riverside and Stockton being a whole lot worse than that.", "Taking this a step further, the next column approximates the price decline implied by the assumptions in the allowance model, from now until the model trough. So, again in short, we've experienced about 9% decline on average in our underlying house prices thus far in the housing slump. And the base model assumptions would imply another 14% to go, we're not quite half way to the decline and again with some fairly wide variations by markets.", "The last set of columns we've shown here are the cumulative losses calculated by the base underlying model.  And total of about 11% for the portfolio and that's up from the 7% to 8% range that we talked  about at the end of the first quarter, reflecting our changed outlook in housing prices.  I'll also say that, in addition to the base model losses, we made several management adjustments to the output to further stress certain markets based upon a variety of factors on what we see on the ground. And so therefore, our overall total cumulative loss for the portfolio today is about 12%.", "The changes in our outlook for housing prices and are updating as [ph] the correlation among the model input based upon our actual experience over the last few months and further management adjustments that I have just described drive the credit costs, we currently see for the remainder of 2008 and 2009 shown on the next slide, slide17.", "The assumptions used for modeling purposes assume basically that housing prices stabilize somewhere around mid 2010 and that our annualized charge-offs peak in 2009 and begin to trend down in 2010 and in 2011. That's why we see anticipated presumably late in 2009. In response, we're taking very aggressive steps to manage our exposure in this portfolio and some of them have already been mentioned on slide 18. We outlined some of these actions highlight and just to reiterate, we have discontinued offering of Pick-A-Pay product and therefore eliminated new loans with negative amortization features. We'll also be discontinuing our wholesale origination channel, which relies upon mortgage brokers in the General B. But focus for our mortgage production going forward will be on our core retail wealth and securities brokerage customers and that is lending, which is traditional business for us and which has held out very well through this housing crisis.", "In addition, we are pursuing strategies to work closely with current Pick-A-Pay customers who craft mutually beneficial ways to reduce our overall concentration in certain markets and to the Pick-A-Pay product. And we are either refocusing or aligning over thousand of our employees to actively manage this activity.", "On slide 19, we've also tightened our lending standards across the mortgage platform by various markets, and this not only encompasses Pick-A-Pay but very much driven by housing price decline dynamics in those markets. We are taking out cost of the mortgage business while at the same time increasing our resources to aggressively manage our problem loans and foreclose properties and we have also dropped the prepayment penalties on Pick-A-Pay loans that may have been a varied [ph] response finance... of ours to refinance and of course discontinued our loan retention efforts for that portfolio.", "Switching gears and flipping over slide 20 relating to partial lending, our total commercial portfolio with $217 billion at quarter end with about $48 billion of that amount in our core commercial real estate portfolio with the rest spread across a number of industries and representing business banking, community banking, middle market and large corporate, but roughly $12 billion in residential related commercial real estate loans are included in the commercial real estate numbers and continue to be our biggest challenge in commercial lending, representing about $2 billion of the total commercial non-performing assets of $3.5 billion. Total charge-offs of $455 million included $262 million in residential related commercial real estate charge-off and if you pull out the impact of residential real estate, commercial... real estate loans from charge-offs for the quarter, commercial charge-offs would have been about 38 basis points.", "As Tom mentioned, flipping over to slide 21, market disruption losses for the quarter were down from the first quarter totaling a little over $900 million versus $2.3 billion in the first quarter, the decrease in losses from the first quarter primarily reflects our risk reduction activities which is focused on both... certainly, but aggressively reducing our exposure to these market sensitive assets. And just to wrap up on slide 22, this captures reduction in exposure and as you can see, in leverage finance we're down quite a bit, our exposure now stands at $3.8 billion, it actually includes $600 million of new business that we committed to you during the quarter that we think is very good new business. Commercial mortgage-backed security", "net exposure is now very modest $750 million, and I think compares very well with other players in the market, it reflects active selling during the quarter was about $2.5 billion sold into the market. And finally our sub-prime related market exposures were down modestly from first quarter. Now Bob has a recap of the credit numbers.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Great, thanks Don, and now what I'll do is try to move to conclude and then we can get to your questions. And I will conclude with talking about the initiatives that are already underway to protect and preserve and generate capital and ensure the right liquidity.", "If you turn to page 24, you can see a summary of the... on the right-hand side, a description graphically of various capital ratios and as we've announced, we are reducing the quarterly dividend to $0.05 per share and that will result in approximately $700 million of capital quarterly being preserved. Nextly, we are reducing expenses as budgeted and deferring capital consuming initiatives and we think that will preserve up to $1.5 billion of capital in the '08, '09 period. Nextly, we are also being much more disciplined about the balance sheet and risk reduction strategies which we think will affect results rather in a $20 billion reduction in loans and securities by this year-end, which should free up as much as $1.5 billion of capital. We also mentioned that Pick-a-Pay refinance, we're going to be driving towards marketable alternatives and that will be a very, very important initiative. We have the potential should we need to, to consider the sale of non-core assets.", "If you turn to Page 25, we drill down in this a bit more with regard to the $1.5 billion of reduction in estimated expenses. We've begun a thorough reduction, a thorough effort of expense reduction in early June and we plan to lower the full-year expenses by a $1.5 billion against budget. That will be about 40% in personal, 25% in other categories, 23% in projects and 12% in marketing and advertising. These initiatives have been identified or/and are in progress. Second half '08 expense benefit of approximately $490 million will be offset by severance and other related costs.", "We are reviewing additionally about 500 existing and planned capital projects and that will result in the delay or cancellation of projects to reduce 2009 CapEx by about $350 million. We believe that these expense actions should have a very modest effect on revenue. We're basically talking about reducing approximately 6,350 active employees today and 4,400 open positions and contractors. Our western retail expansion will continue but at  a more deliberate pace. We expect to improve the 2009 overhead efficiency ratio by 200 to 300 basis points from the normalized level of approximately 57% and all of this should preserve $1 billion of capital.", "On 26... page 26, we talk about some other aspects, which I'll go through quickly with regard to $20 billon reduction as I mentioned of loans and securities. We will focus on the reinvestment of maturing securities and be quite focused there and lean towards very little reinvestment. We'll also have enhanced discipline with regard to commercial lending to be sure that we're focused on our very most important strategic relationships. We will have new return targets for renewals and new commitments to ensure that we are using our capital in the most judicious fashion. We will have active programs to further enhance the mix of our consumer loan portfolios, reducing the mortgage concentration by tightening standards, discontinuing negative am [ph] option loan originations, eliminating the General Bank wholesale channel, and eliminating the focus on Pick-A-Pay mortgage retention.", "We are offering opportunities also for people to refinance into confirming products, and so then we have additional measures of enhanced pricing in the auto portfolio, and continuing to review non-core assets. On page 27, we basically talk a bit about liquidity, which we realize as an important issue. We basically are proactively managing liquidity and capital, given this environment.", "We have significantly increased funding availability in face of the rising industry challenges. The Wachovia Holding Company continues to maintain a very prudent liquidity profile. At the holding company level, we have a cash position of $22 billion at quarter and, which equates to approximately 3.5 years of long-term debt maturities, but we have premarket disruption cash position of $14 billion as of June 30, and we have now enhanced flexibility and liquidity as a result of the aforementioned dividend reduction.", "Wachovia continues to be a provider of excess liquidity to the market. Our retail brokerage average deposit products increased $5.7 billion, quarter-over-quarter with expected new balances of $10 billion over the next several quarters. Balance sheet strategies and asset sales are anticipated when needed to further enhance the strong balance bank liquidity position.", "And now, let me turn to the last page of our presentation. I just want to make a few comments first about the environment overall. There is no question that the economy, financial markets, housings, and financial services and Wachovia are all facing challenges. Progress is being made in working through these issues, but there will be more challenges ahead.", "When we communicate with you, our goal is to be realistic and balanced and cautious and as Mathew Smith says prudently paranoid. Secondly, there is no question that given the cycle, and where we are that credit costs will rise as you would expect given these conditions.", "In summary, we at Wachovia understand our issues and challenges, we are already addressing them, and we will be taking further actions. We believe we are facing up to and are realistic with regards to the realities of housing and its expected deterioration. We are discontinuing the negative amortization product and exiting the General Bank wholesale channel. We are committed to a strong balance sheet, and protecting and creating shareholder value. We have several initiatives as we have described underway to protect, preserve, and generate capital and additional options are open to us.", "Our core businesses are attractive and performing well. We are committed to strengthening them, while continuing to excel and improve our operations. Just a few weeks ago Matthew Smith said that we were committed to providing to you extensive details with regard to our business performance and challenges. And we hope today that we begun to move forward in the fashion.", "Let me now open the line for questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will be from Jefferson Harralson with KBW.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Hi, thanks. I want to ask you about the call on capital that could be coming in the form of the prudential put, I've seen it written that, that it could be a $5 billion evaluation at some point in the future. What is your... what were your thoughts about the potential of a prudential put and how can you plan for that potential event?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Great, thank you. As I said earlier, we have all of our division leaders here and so I'm going to refer that to David Carroll, who is sitting here with me. Thank you.", "David Carroll - Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Capital", "Yes thanks, Bob. First of all, I should make sure everyone is aware that the partnership with Pru has been quite a good one for both of us. And Pru has been pretty candid about their satisfaction with that partnership. As you know, in the formation agreement, which is a public document, it was revealed that they... their first put option was eligible for July 1 of this year. I would be surprised if they put it given the profitability of this venture. Also, the benefits of the AG Edwards acquisition won't be fully borne out until 2009. Edwards placed the value of their put would be significantly enhanced by the $680 million and expense efficiencies that we are on track to get. So, certainly can't speak for Prudential, but given the nature of our relationship for the past five years, the profitability of this, and the value ahead, we'd be surprised by that.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "All right. If it's true that the Prudential put would be $5 billion, it kind of assumes that your value in it is $15 billion, would you guys consider selling this business, is there anything in the contract that would prevent you from selling it, and what would be... what is your basis in the investment right now?", "David Carroll - Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Capital", "This is David Carroll again. I'll defer to Tom Wurtz on any comment on the basis that we are the majority owner of this business and the only thing that requires a super majority, both in the formation agreement would be change in ownership, that is something that we could do and I'll defer to Bob on where this fits into our overall strategy.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Tom, do you want to comment on the basis?", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "All I can say Jefferson, I wish I had somebody to defer to you on that one too, because I don't know the answer to that and I'm sure the IR team can filter [ph] that back to you.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "I think that in terms of... I'm giving my arms [ph] around the all the strategic questions along with my colleagues but I just think that from our perspective this is a core part of our business in our franchise model, it's worked out well, the collaboration with the Prudential has been good and we are working into that process but we're also always thinking about the what ifs or what coulds, but it is something that view as an attractive business opportunity and it also fits in well with a lot of the other aspects of Wealth Management and Asset Management where we have a great, great potential to build on these existing skills. You look at the breadth of the opportunity and that we're strong and well positioned in so many parts of asset management that [inaudible] to a great business for us to continue to drive and grow and we're quite excited about it.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "All right. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Mike Mayo with Deutsche Bank.", "Michael  Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Hi, Mike.", "Michael  Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Bob, you are  new as CEO, you've had a record in government, many years at Goldman Sachs, you have nothing to defend. What's your view about Wachovia needing to raise additional capital?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "I think that we've taken what we believe are some really clear and instantly measurable steps of which were hard decisions to reduce the dividend, point one. Point two, we have outlined a series of projects and plans that are in process already that we believe will give us a substantial improvement in our capital ratios. We have other leverage should those not be enough, but I think you can hopefully hear the determination to work through this situation and to the very best of our ability, be thinking about what's best for our shareholders as we work through this.", "Michael  Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "So, do I read that to say you are not raising additional capital any time soon?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "We are raising lots of capital by reducing the dividend, managing our expenses and running our businesses better, and that's the plan for now.", "Michael  Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "What about through a common stock issuance?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "That's not on the plan. We recognize the different costs of capital and was... as I try to describe that we have lots of options for what we can do and while I can't tell you what will unfold, I can tell you that for now that our plans are to improve our capital position by the ways in which was outlined in this presentation.", "Michael  Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "And then when you refer to the $4 billion of pre-provision, pre-tax earnings, I guess that's $16 billion of cushion to absorb loan losses each year. Did that factor into your analysis?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Mike, absolutely. The fundamental strength of the businesses are evident by that illustration. Now we don't expect not to post a provision and we don't expect that there won't be additional market disruption losses or something else on the horizon that generally comes in a difficult operating environment. But it does give a very strong sense of the core underlying capacity to absorb losses and to build reserves over the intermediate time frame.", "Michael  Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Then my last two related questions, you had $9 billion of notable items, how much more notable items might we see over the next quarter or two? I think we see over $1 billion of reserve bills and Pick-a-Pay based on slide 17. So that might be... when, how much more notable items might you have in the next couple of quarters. And can you reconcile your 11% cum losses on Pick-a-Pay with some of the trading values and some of the securities at like 45% losses?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "On the first one Mike, it is certainly impossible to estimate what the notable losses could be in the future. What I'll say is we've taken the actions to reduce exposures which subject us to market volatility. We have addressed in a permanent way, things like the SILO, we've made very substantive additions to legal reserves, the asset security or the security sales or discretionary items. And so therefore we've certainly diminished the universe of things that could coagulate in the future, but it will be bullish for me to sit here today and suggest that we won't have or that all the industry participants won't have additional things that disappoint them.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "I think Mike, with regard to your second question, I'll invite Don to comment. But I think what we've done in this middle section is described in excruciating detail, we hope in interesting detail and there is even more in the appendix that basically talks about this where we think we're describing how we're viewing this portfolio, we're trying to be forward-looking and straightforward about this and we think our description is consistent with what's appropriate. Don, would you like to add anything?", "Don Truslow \u2013 Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Bob, just to add to that. We think we've taken a realistic view based upon our current outlook. And I'm not sure how to reconcile it with Mike what you're seeing in the market and certain securities other than the product features and just what may be very portfolio specific. But again we tried to provide lots of information here for investors have a good sense of what is in the portfolio, and how we're thinking about it.", "Michael  Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "But when you try to sell some of these assets, what is the liquidity like when you try to sell it... what's the liquidity like today versus say early '07?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Well, it is Bob. I'll start again and I will let Don comment. I think that we haven't been selling, we've looked at a variety of ways in which to extract value, manage the portfolio, focus on modifications, refinancings and things like that, and that has been our strategy.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Also, it has been a very illiquid market, and so not sure it makes a whole lot of sense for us to sell portions of the portfolio right now.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "And there's also the prospect in some cases of converting to conventional products. So I think we have... again a series of alternatives as opposed to just one that might be selling into a stressed illiquid environment.", "Michael  Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Meredith Whitney with Oppenheimer.", "Meredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Questions, one is specific and one is more general. Of the roughly $315 million reduction in CapEx, can you say what that is as a percentage of total I mean what specific projects will be reduced under that umbrella? That is my first question.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Meredith, just in terms of some of the things as Bob mentioned, we are going to reduce the intensity of the branch expansion. We also... there is a variety of projects that address underlying discretionary infrastructure activities that will be delayed. Just across the company, what you find is that with a company as broad as ours that there are literally hundreds of projects, it is about 500 that will be under review, and each one of those consumes a relatively modest amount of capital. And when you put those on the shelf, I mean you end up saving a very substantial amount.", "Meredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay. And just to remind, what percentage of total is that from the CapEx budget?", "David Carroll - Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Capital", "Meredith, this is David Carroll. I sort of oversaw this initiative over the last five weeks, and basically what we did to give a little more detail on it. We took the first six months of this year's actual run rate expenses in the company, and looked at the next 18 months forecast, we've backed out occupancy and incentives, and sought to reduce that in the way that would not impact any ongoing operations, service-quality, cycle times and those kinds of things. The  $1.5 billion represents a 9% reduction to the forward spend, and as our forward view would hold it right now or have it right now, actual expenses next year would be below this year's actual... about $200 million, but it is $1.5 billion off of the forward run rate. And Bob covered the composition of that, it is 6,600 existing MTE's, it is canceling 4,400 open positions. Basically we've taken a good bit of growth initiatives that we are in our forward plan out, reflecting the current market environment that we are in.", "Meredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay. I guess I was just trying to get in terms of the technology investments and things like that. But if we don't have specific number for CapEx budget, is that what you are saying?", "David Carroll - Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Capital", "The technology component of that is --", "Meredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Or just more broadly... just as specific CapEx budget?", "David Carroll - Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Capital", "I don't have the total for that, sorry.", "Meredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay. Thanks for that. On page 5, this is sort of my broader question, and you review your growth in CD's. My broad question is you guys have a big deposit base, and access to federal home loan borrowing. Why now would you grow what is relatively more expensive, cost of borrowing or why not my point is why wouldn't you go through your core deposit base, why won't you go through Federal Home Loan, FHLB borrowing as your mortgage portfolio growth and things like that?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "There is a couple of reasons Meredith. First of all, I'd point, we want to meet the needs of existing customers, you can see that 52% of these incremental CDs were sold to our existing customers. It can be useful customer acquisition strategy and you see that roughly more than a third of the CDs were sold to new customers. If you look at the raw rate that's paid you may conclude [inaudible] that's a high incremental cost. However the reality is, customers tend to renew their CDs upon maturity, customers tend to buy other products during the term of the CDs and when you blend those two things then, we think it's very compelling from a financing standpoint as well as building the franchise. So we really don't have any question about the financial attractiveness of the strategy we perceived.", "Meredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.", "So, you would you say that your growth in CDs is a marketing investment, because obviously it's relatively more expensive than your core deposit in HFLB borrowing base?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Meredith, let Ben Jenkins jump into here. He can provide some perspective.", "Benjamin Jenkins - Vice Chairman and President of the General Bank", "Meredith, Hi. I would say a couple of things, I'd want to remind you that real deposit focuses on low cost core and we are pleased with low cost core relationship deposits and the growth we are getting there, both in money market and in checking. We see this from a customer acquisition standpoint, optimistically, there are times that we want do it... at times we've don't. As Tom mentioned early in the quarter, we did not and we let because of the pricing, FCGs run down, we thought now it was appropriate from a pricing standpoint and we are offering those CDs attracting a lot of non-customers that we would hope and work to cross sell. 80% of the CDs that we sold have been to new customers and we will work hard to sell those additional products.", "Meredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, fine, thank you.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Chris  Mutascio with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Christopher  Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "I think, Don, I have the quick question for you I believe.  If I go to page 17 in the slide, you talk about the updated reserve model for the Pick-A-Pay. If I look at the second half credit cost, I guess, the way I read that, $3.6 billion that's roughly $1.8 billion a quarter, so is it implying a $2 billion reduction in the reserve build for the Pick-A-Pay going forward on a quarterly basis?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Christopher, as part of your question, we see building the reserve by $1.3 billion roughly for the second half of the year. And then as we head into '09 as I mentioned in the comments, we would expect that right now our assumptions would be that we begin to see a leveling out of housing and therefore trailing down of charge-off in 2010, 2011, which would impact the need to either reserve build...build reserves in 2009 or begin releasing reserves in 2009.", "Christopher  Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "I probably didn't state that correctly, I was looking at second quarter you had about $3.8 billion in credit costs related to Pick-A-Pay, which includes the additional provision. And if we just look at the second half of the year looking at $3.6 billion and divide that by two to get a quarterly run rate, that's $1.8 billion. So it looks like the reserve building certainly will be a significant going forward off of the second quarter level?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "That's correct.", "Christopher  Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "And then, can you also comment, and may be this is a question for Bob, but on that same slide, above model the output does not reflect the anticipated benefit of planned portfolio reduction and other mitigation strategies. Can you provide a little more color on what those strategies might be?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Sure. I'll start and then maybe invite some my colleagues, but I think that and the reality is that the news in some case good, in some case different is that we control these assets and they're subject to us doing lots of things with them and whether it's working on modification, refinancing, getting people into different products, government guaranteed, and things like that. But this is an active effort on our part to manage this portfolio for long-term value, and we're going to be doing that with a relentless focus. Anything you want to add to that?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "I would just add that as we look at a borrower who is undergoing stress, if that borrower is in a market that we anticipate will substitute decline, we're probably less likely to modify that loan if it isn't apparent that borrowers can have the capacity and the willingness over the immediate horizon to continue to make payments and then we begin to investigate more aggressively, is there an opportunity to encourage a short sale, is there a way to provide assistance to the borrower in terms of a refinance opportunity where we would offer concessions [ph] or offer assistance of buying down the rate on a new purse. So there is a variety of things that we can employ, we're willing to put a wholehearted effort towards it. And at this point, it's just impossible to estimate what the customer response will be to it as we have just essentially gone through them this week.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "And I think that there is good news and different news and things and the fact that we control them and on our balance sheet and they are regionally concentrated, then it makes it more... it's more efficient or effective for us to think about that. And our goal is not... we are not planning to sell these assets, we're planning just do what we can to realize value over an intermediate period of time.", "Christopher  Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Fair enough. Just one follow-up question, this last one. Tom, going back to the first question on the call, if Prudential were to put back the JV to you, you can pay for that in stock rather than to come on in cash?", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That is correct.", "Christopher  Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "All right. Thank you very much", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Good morning. Three questions here. Number one, in several places in the slide deck, you mentioned a review and possible sale of non-core assets. Could you just give us some idea of what might be considered a non-core asset and what the timeframe is, you are going to be taking here to make that decision?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Well, let's see, I think I can... may be... it's Bob Nancy. I can give you, I think, some idea but probably not as much as you would like. I think the reality is that we are looking at everything and evaluating different activities. But there are certain things and businesses that we have that are not central to what we view as our mission. And we're going to focus on those and try to understand the various alternatives. The reality is too that we described we think a series of rolling activity, some of which are already in process of achieving capital increases by not selling assets. And we are going to focus on those, and I think we'll have more to report in the months ahead as we try to think about these different issues.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Would these be primarily commercial businesses or assets or if you could just give us some idea of which part of the balance sheet they would becoming from?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "I think I would really like if you just give me a bit of pause here for me to buy a bit of time. And I think, we'll try to give more context and structure to this in the next couple of months.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Question for Tom. The ongoing impact of the SILO issue, can you just tell us what that's going to be? We just went through this exercise, the few core things unlike that your approach or your thoughts are on this?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "It's really quite insignificant as we look forward to next year, I think it's in the neighborhood of the $30 million drag, something like that over the next... till 2009. So it's relatively immaterial for the next four, five years and then finally sometime in the mid-teen years like 2013, 2014, you'll begin to see the recapture of this recast right off which stands over the next 30 years, so it's pretty immaterial to earnings in the intermediate product.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC", "So we shouldn't be building anything in the margin impact, etcetera, etcetera for the... looking forward.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "$30 million or $40 million next year is probably, at least holdings.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Okay. And a question, final question for Ben. Ben, this is your [inaudible], of course, you've got the much discussed 4.25% 12 months CD out there, which seems to be the leader in the CD effort. Can you just tell us what kind of deposits and relationships you've gone on with this thus far?", "Benjamin Jenkins - Vice Chairman and President of the General Bank", "Nancy, I made some reference to that in I think, Meredith's question, we brought in $12 billion or $13 billion in that offering and we've been able... I don't have the figures, we are pleased with our checking sales against that, and I know the number of new customer base was 36% or something like that. So there's a big new customer element there that we can... or it's 80% new customers, so there's a big element of new customers that we can work for cross sales. Already the cross sales on the checking side are good, but I don't have that percentage number.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Nancy, it is Bob again. Hopefully we can give you more information in the not too distant future and I admit to being a bit evasive with question one, but we will work hard to be more constructive and to keep you posted as things unfold. Thanks a lot for your patience.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Ed Najarian with Merrill Lynch.", "Edward Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "Nancy and Mike pretty much asked my main questions. So I guess, I just have one more question for Don. Could you give us some idea  to what extent the $12 billion or the $11.9 billion in non-performing assets have been written down to fair market value? Just broadly, don't need it category by category, but just to what extent should we anticipate or think about additional losses coming from what's already on NPA status?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Yes Ed, it's very good question. And on slide 42, there is a bar graph that basically outlines the non-performs related to the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. So, just under $7 billion shown here, and this wouldn't include the other real estate, and so you can see out of this portfolio, there's about $500 million or so that it's already been written down, and then of the $3 billion, $3.5 billion of commercial non-performs, roughly speaking between what we have specifically reserved and FAS 114 reserves or written down, the combination of those two things would be kind of in the 25% to 30% range roughly, where we've already basically recognized the credit costs. I don't know if that helped or not, I don't have a lot on top of my head, the... what would make up the reminder, but that would be roughly $10 billion or so of total of $12 billion.", "Edward Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "And I guess I was a little  bit confusing. What would be $10 billion of the $12 billion?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Well, the matter is that, what I've just mentioned to about Pick-a-Pay is about $7 billion and then the commercial non-performs was a little over $3 billion. The total of those two, $7 billion and $3 billion would be about $10 billion, $12 billion of the total non-performs. So I just don't know... it came at the top of my head what, how to mention the other $2 billion.", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, [inaudible] given attribution to 10 or 12 and if you... and we can get you more detail on the other two.", "Edward Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So just maybe to isolate that 10 of the 12, it sounds though like there could be some fairly material additional write downs or charges may be is a better... or charges against the existing reserve related to that $10 billion. Is that a fair assessment?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Edward, we just have to see as things unfold, but obviously part of the $4.2 billion reserve bill would include our view of remaining a loss content in our non-perform portfolio.", "Edward Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "Great. How would that go against existing reserves, but in your mind, not really come through future provisions?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "That would all depend upon our evaluation of the allowance in the future periods, again our evaluation of the lost content of the portfolio at the time.", "Edward Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, all right. Thank you.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Tom, did you want to add something?", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Ed, clearly the reserve that we have for the Pick-a-Pay portfolio reflects the losses we expect in the existing non-perform portfolio as well as the entire performing portfolio. Right now the reserves or the charge offs that have been taken against the NPAs are something less than 10% of the NPAs we've been experiencing severities in mid-30s, so with every one of those loans went through and experience something similar, and they'll be somewhere around $1 billion more to take and that was incorporated into the existing reserve delta.", "Edward Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, okay. Yes, that's very helpful. Thank you.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Todd Hagerman with Credit Suisse.", "Todd  Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Good morning everybody. Just a couple of questions. Just in terms of deleveraging the $20 billion EBITDA identified, if you could just give us a sense of the mix between just in terms of the existing securities run off as well as how you are thinking between the consumer commercial portfolio. And specifically assuming again that there is something specifically been identified, any potential for impairment that is coming down the road?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Tom you want to start?", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "When you speak of impairments, are you referring to goodwill impairment?", "Todd  Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "No, no. Just in terms of the prospects for loan sales or asset sales, if you will, presumably the $20 billion figure has something specific identified?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yes, it doesn't anticipate sales at this point. As you can imagine starting out with the $127 billion Pick-a-Pay portfolio with no new origination, and the absence of a prepayment penalty as a disincentive. We've been experiencing prepayments of around 12% to 14% over the last several months. So you can do the math there to figure out what the impact there would be. We also think that given the core volume was related to the way the prepayment penalty that will stimulate, in at least in the near-term a higher prepayment rate. We have alluded to the fact that we're going to be very aggressively trying to interact with customers to identify refinance or short sell opportunities for them. And then, in the securities portfolio, maturities probably will be somewhere around $5.5 billion to $6 billion over the remainder of the year so that gives you a good starting point. And then across the franchise, again as we look at all our relationships and that is whether they're... a core relationship with many aspects to it or whether it's credit only we have the opportunity for non-renewals, and by uprising of incremental credits, that will also provide some relief on the inflow side. So I think we feel pretty good about the ability to achieve this over the remainder of the year.", "Todd  Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "And so, right now Tom, you don't anticipate a specific loan portfolio or package sale?", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The $20 billion does not kind of play that. Now, marketing conditions may change such that that is attractive right now that would not be something that would be on the table.", "Todd  Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then just secondarily going back to Don and your earlier comments you indicated that you have taken certainly a more negative view of housing since the first quarter and that's certainly reflected in the reserve methodology in your assumptions there. But I guess at this stage of the game, it's certainly it's fair to assume that this is getting worse. But why could this not very well change in the coming quarter or so, and what gives you kind of comfort at this stage that the 12% cumulative [ph] loss assumption, if you will is kind of the right number?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Todd, well, it's a very dynamic market and like everybody else we will adjust as things unfold. But we think we have got what is a very realistic outlook based upon what we're seeing on the ground and from other sources and our economists and so we feel that the actions we took at the end of the second quarter were very, very appropriate and that reserve is adequate.", "There are some out in the market that are talking about a potentially more pessimistic view and some that are talking about more optimistic view and I think it's just a reflection of -- it's being a very dynamic market and very impressive environment.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "And I think Todd, it is Bob that if you look at page 15 to 16 in the appendices, you can model off of our assumptions. And we try to take a balanced perspective given the environment, and we have also tried to be very transparent as to how we're thinking about it, and allow you to challenge the model in different ways yourself, and we will continue to do the same thing too, consistent with what we see in the market.", "Todd  Hagerman - Credit Suisse", "Terrific. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Matthew O'Connor with UBS.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor - UBS", "Hi, guys. I might have missed this. But what is the deferred interest for the Golden West portfolio, any risk of reversals there?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "And that... search for the...", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "$3.8 million... $2.8 billion Matt. And when you say is there a risk of reversal, I would just say that it adds to the principal balance of a loan, it is that particular loan with a deferred interest balance and then there is no difference than any other aspect of the principal balance.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "And Matt this is Don, in the appendix on page 30...43 there is a schematic that outlines the breakdown of deferred interest. And deferred interest at the end of the quarter represent just a little over 3%, and that's been relatively consistent over the last few quarters.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor - UBS", "Okay. That's helpful. And then kind of a bigger picture question. I know it is tough to look out a few years here, as you think about the balance sheet and  lot of the Golden West portfolio runs off and shrinks into other areas how would you expect to reinvest some of those assets to get freed up or should we expect $100 billion or $150 billon deleveraging, over the next few years.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "It's Bob again. I just feel like... I'd like to speak to that issue after a bit more time. We're really focused here on dealing with the challenges with the credit issues that we've raised, number one, and number two making sure that these strong business franchises get managed and that we set the stage for continued growth where we have so many opportunities. And I think as we... and this is probably my fault, I just feel like I need to have a better understanding to give you a more complete answer. But in the sake, in the spirit of full disclosure, we'll be talking about that in the months ahead. But I just ask to back off a bit, so I said our key focuses are working on our balance sheet and making sure these strong business franchises get the right attention they deserve.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor - UBS", "Yes, fair point. Just lastly, is there any benefits to moving the Golden West  portfolio to discontinued operations?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "I suppose the only benefit, I would have to check to see whether that is something we could do, but  the only benefit would be that it moves it away from the general bank to provide more clarity and it makes the schedule that we showed on the page with and without mortgage in the general bank unnecessary, but that's something we'll give some considerations to math.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Yes, I think that where it is, is a state of mind. We are focused basically on making sure we understand it that we have the realistic expectations and that we do our very best to achieve the best outcomes from the portfolio of assets that we own on our balance sheet in a concentrated area, which gives us lots of alternatives, and that's our focus.", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Brian  Foran with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian  Foran - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. Yes, I think that's the most loss estimates for option ARMs, they partially lie on the fact that most borrowers are making the minimum payment and thus eventually will hit the LTV recast and also an assumption that most borrowers who recastle eventually fall. Do you have what percentage of Pick-a-Pay borrowers are currently making the minimum payment. And then secondly, if we just look at that Pick-a-Pay borrowers who've hit the LTV recast to date realizing it's a small piece of the overall group, what is the frequency of the fall for those borrowers?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Sure. We've got that here. Give us just a second to get to the right page and then we can refer you to it.", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Brian, this is Don. We are looking in the appendix, page 40 would address the pattern of recast, Brian, which I think would probably give people a fair sense of comfort  in terms of what would be subject to recasts based on the 125% balance limitation. And for anyone that doesn't have the deck in front of them, basically it's $7.5 million in 2009, $20 million in 2010, $85 million in 2011 and about $650 million when we out to 2012. It's probably worth also noting that in the modeling, it assumes that when somebody loses their equity, they go to the minimum pay option. So, that is embedded in the credit modeling.", "Brian  Foran - Goldman Sachs", "And what would be the frequency you have to follow for people who hit the recast?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "There have been so few that have actually hit the recast... who would be measured like a hundred people in history, something that we have been evidence of.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "We can check on and if you have questions feel free to follow-up with Don or Tom or myself directly.", "Brian  Foran - Goldman Sachs", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Ron Mandel with GIC", "Ron Mandel - GIC", "I was just wondering, Tom, about your comments in the outlook for the net interest margin or net interest revenue likely to be down from the adjusted first half level, and obviously, I see the decline in assets you're talking about, but I was wondering if you can talk about the margin and why the margin might not offset almost the asset run?", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, we're going to have the continued drag of an increase in NPAs, Ron, which gives these folks obviously, right now we're having $12 billion of assets that went up during the yield on, we still haven't fund those, and then as margin [inaudible] incrementally goes non performing, you lose the coupons on it. So that's... that's really the biggest drag.", "Ron Mandel - GIC", "I guess, I just would have thought that you already have a lot of non performers, so then you have margin improvement this quarter. So, I guess, that's why I was asking the question.", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, all I can tell you this is our best guess as to what will occur, just wanted to provide now really rosy sort of expectations that we've been hit, this is what we believe.", "Ron Mandel - GIC", "And in terms of positioning for how rates have changed and how they might change, have you changed your positioning in that regard?", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, we are relatively neutral through year-end, and then we would be liability sensitive in 2009, and I would say right now, the four incurs are consistently built in, relatively aggressive rate hikes, and therefore we're considerably locked in the current rates because they are just in the core markets. We think the likelihood that rates move a 100 basis points more than that to be relatively modest based on everything we see today.", "Ron Mandel - GIC", "Okay, thanks.", "Tom Wurtz - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question will be from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks, good morning. On the page 26, when you talk about the $20 billion reduction, I guess just want to confirm that most of that reduction in long-term securities you're anticipating through roll off, is that correct?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Yes, the vast majority would be.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then since you're just continuing these various channels of mortgage origination, I just wanted to understand what you are expecting for your total mortgage book, I mean, I'm assuming that you're not... since you're active and trying to renegotiate and restructure some of these loans into more conventional loans. And I think that you are looking over teams some of that's for your balance sheet, I'm just trying to understand how large do you see your mortgage book being over the course of the next year or two?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "I'd just offer a general observation, and that is that with respect to the existing mortgage business, it's really going to be focused, it's going to be a customer-centric model serving the needs of the general banking, wealth management, and Wachovia securities customers. Therefore I would anticipate that that would produce much growth in terms of our initiatives as we work with pick-a-pay customers, our primary objective would be to refinance them into, perhaps the government product where the vast majority of those would be securitized. And so, we may end up with some on our portfolio, but in general, I think you can probably for modeling purposes assume that whatever success we have is evidenced by the balance going away from the company.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "So you have roughly $120 billion of negative amortization loans. We would, you suggested that we should anticipate that that's primarily and roll off the entire portfolio?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Absolutely.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So then when you're speaking about the ... have you anticipate the losses within that portfolio of migrating as the portfolio is rolling off.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Well, Jonathan [ph] a pretty good job of giving you a view as to what our future credit expectations are in terms of both charge-off as well as over provisioning through the end of 2009. What I would say is, there is nothing explicitly built in for whatever success we have in working with borrowers to refi them and tell their product. There is always the chance that as we look at a borrower, we would have anticipated a loss, that was going to occur in 2010, we take action today which incurs a credit cost that we experience today. And therefore there is some asymmetry between the reserves we had built and the current credit cost.  Alternatively, it's just as likely that we've taken action with a customer that wasn't explicitly provided a foreign reserve and we favor or sell something. So I don't think it's going to be at this point something that causes people to need to model credit cost differently because of our outward actions with customers. And as we experience the customer reaction will that help let people know what it is.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And as you think about that portfolio, rolling off overtime, I mean, how have you thought about the kind of capital requirements for that portfolio relative to a regular loan portfolio where you are building, growing that portfolio overtime? Do you think that the capital requirement as differently?", "Don Truslow \u2013 Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "Well, certainly this portfolio is more capital intensive as evidenced by the credit losses that we are experiencing. In the near-term, I think where we... what we are focused on is building our capital ratios and I think for the foreseeable horizon just growing capital ratios to the greatest extent we can is what we're focused on. And if I mentioned at some point, we will revisit whether redeploying some of the freed up capital is appropriate thing to do. But in the near term you should think of just harboring that capital as the balance sheet declines from that portfolio.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "It's Bob Steel. I think too I push pause and buy a bit of time here. One of the things we spend a lot of time talking about is the right allocation of our capital in terms of the asset to support and how to think about that. And that will be a project that we focus on and we'll look forward to reporting into you [ph] in the not too distant future. But you raised a good point and it has our focus.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And at this stage you haven't changed your capital targets, is that correct?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "No.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentle, we have reached the allotted time for question. Your last question will be from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Good morning. Don, can you us some color on the non-performing assets in the commercial, finance and agriculture line. Then also in the commercial real estate non-performers of 2.2 billion, what percentage were construction loans versus commercial real estate mortgages?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "On the commercial real estate, the vast majority of the commercial real estate non-performs would be out of that 11, $12 billion builder residential related books. So those would be in the category of loan to builders or land. So mostly you can think about it in the construction arena, but land would also be a fairly significant component as well. And then on the remainder of the commercial... of the C&I side, there is really... part of your question is there's really not an underlying pattern or theme to the credits that we have... had go non-perform from an industry standpoint. They tend to be a little more one-off, maybe a little more oriented toward credits that have some tie to real estate such has build and supply and companies that service the real estate business, but there is not really a discernible underlying kind of industry [inaudible].", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "And sticking with the commercial loans on the NPAs. Can you give us any color, I believe the shared national credit exam has just ended. Any color on what you're hearing from that?", "Don Truslow - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer", "My sense is that the OCC and the system and the Fed have taken a very, very thorough look given just concerns that they have about the economy and where the credit cycle is unfolding and so, pretty thorough review. We are very pleased with the outcomes of our portfolio, and I guess it will be some time in the third quarter, maybe early third quarter when they typically released the overall industry portfolio statistics. So it will be interesting to see what those look like.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "And then finally, Bob obviously you've hit the ground running. And are you planning to do any long-term strategic planning in the next three to six months how to position Wachovia for the future and should we expect some sort of announcement regarding that at some point in the future?", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Well I think you are leading me in the right direction. I think that it has been great to get here and to work with the team. And our focus as I have said near-term is to deal with the challenged assets, which we accept responsibility for and to work through those issues, and ensure that our balance sheet is strong and that we're marshalling our capital in the right way.", "The second issue is to make sure we focus on these very, very strong of core franchises that we have, which are doing pretty darn well. And we really want to focus on our customers, and our clients and our colleagues to make sure we continue to execute very strongly in those areas. Once we get through that stage, we are all looking forward here at Wachovia to sitting down and looking at what we have learned, and where we should position the company for the longer-term. And as I have said earlier, we'll be very open and transparent as we work those issues and look forward to speaking to you as they become more clear.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Robert K. Steel - Chief Executive Officer and President", "Great. I think that's it and so again let me just say thanks to everyone for providing your time. I know how busy you are especially on a day like today with so many different calls and comments. This was an important call for Wachovia, and we appreciate you giving attention to all the things we are working so hard on.

(NASDAQ:WB) Q3 2008 Earnings Call October 22, 2008 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Alice Lehman - Director, Wachovia Investor Relations ", "Robert K. Steel - CEO and President ", "David Zwiener - CFO ", "Kenneth Phelan - Chief Risk Officer ", "Alice Lehman", "Thank you for calling in to Wachovia\u2019s third quarter 2008 pre-recorded earnings review call. This is Alice Lehman, Director of Investor Relations. ", "Before you listen to the rest of this call, you may want to go to our website at wachovia.com/investor, and download the slide presentation we\u2019ll be referring to throughout. Also on our website, you can obtain a copy of today\u2019s earnings press release and tables and our supplemental quarterly earning report. ", "In this call, we\u2019ll review our third quarter financial highlights deck. In addition, this call will be available on our website through January 16, 2009, at 800-642-1687 for U.S. callers and 706-645-9291 for international callers - Conference ID: 69710892. The call is also available on the Internet at wachovia.com/investor. ", "Our CEO Bob Steel will kick things off; he'll be followed by CFO David Zwiener, and our Chief Risk Officer, Kenneth Phelan. ", "Before we begin, I have a few reminders: First, any forward-looking statements made during this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause Wachovia's results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements are set forth in Wachovia's public documents filed with the SEC, including Wachovia's current report on Form 8-K filed today. ", "Second, some of the discussion about our company\u2019s performance today will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information that reconciles those measures to GAAP measures can be found in our filings with the SEC and in the news release and supplemental material located at Wachovia.com/investor. ", "Third, Wachovia\u2019s proposed merger with Wells Fargo will be addressed in a definitive proxy statement/prospectus to be filed with the SEC, and we urge you to read that document when it becomes available because it will contain important information. Information regarding the participants in the proxy solicitation is contained in our annual proxy material filed with the SEC, and will also be contained in the definitive proxy statement/prospectus. That document and other SEC filings can be obtained for free at the SEC\u2019s website and from Wachovia and Wells Fargo. ", "Now let me turn things over to Bob Steel.", "Robert K. Steel ", "Thank you, Alice. Hello, and thank you for joining us today. I will turn it over in a moment to David Zwiener, our CFO and Ken Phelan, our Chief Risk Officer, to discuss our third quarter, but first let me say a few introductory words on our pending combination with Wells Fargo. ", "Clearly, these are extraordinary times. While we are disappointed that Wachovia will not remain independent, we are enthusiastic about the prospects that lie ahead for a combination with Wells Fargo. ", "When I arrived at Wachovia about three months ago, we immediately got to work addressing the well-known challenges on our balance sheet. We cut the dividend and were working hard to make adjustments to the balance sheet and reduce our expenses. While we were making progress on these initiatives, as everyone now knows, the market environment changed more precipitously than anyone had expected and we had to move quickly and in a different direction to act in the best interests of, and preserve value for all of our constituencies", "Our board approved the combination with Wells Fargo, and it\u2019s an exciting combination. Wachovia\u2019s shareholders will be owners of one of the world\u2019s strongest financial institutions. It represents good value under the circumstances for our shareholders; it gives them upside in a stronger combined company;  and it preserves the best of what is Wachovia and our culture. ", "Wells Fargo is strong and stable and active in 80 different financial services businesses. Wells is number 1 in many areas including small business lending, agricultural lending and commercial real estate brokerage. It is number 2 in mortgage origination and servicing and debit cards and has the largest bank-owned insurance brokerage. ", "In many ways, Wachovia is the mirror image of Wells Fargo. We are one of the nation\u2019s largest diversified financial service companies, with a successful full service retail brokerage, a banking presence in 21 states and very strong core franchises. We are also the number one retail bank in the Southeast. ", "I would also add that Wells Fargo is inheriting a strong, dedicated team here at Wachovia. During these difficult times, my colleagues have demonstrated that Wachovia always puts the interests of our customers and clients first. We at Wachovia have long respected Wells Fargo from afar and are confident that the combined organization will benefit from the marriage of their sales and cross-selling culture with our highly rated culture of customer service. ", "Let\u2019s just close our eyes and imagine what the combination of Wachovia and Wells Fargo will create: one of the strongest financial companies in the world with $1.4 trillion in assets and $787 billion in deposits; we\u2019ll be a premier coast-to-coast banking franchise with a presence in 39 states; and we\u2019ll have the second largest retail brokerage in the U.S. ", "Since the announcement of our merger with Wells Fargo, we have taken specific steps to enhance our liquidity position and are experiencing stabilizing deposit activities. These developments have given us the ability to more proactively support the needs of our customers and clients in these challenging times. Further, we look forward to partnering with Wells Fargo to leverage our industry-leading sales and service cultures to soundly and profitably grow market share in today\u2019s economic environment. This combination makes sense for Wachovia\u2019s shareholders, and the marketplace, recognizing the value of this transaction, clearly agrees. ", "The deal represents a complete company bid without direct government assistance, and there is strong cultural compatibility between these two firms. The Federal Reserve has approved the combination and we expect the transaction to close by the end of the year subject to shareholder approval. ", "With that, let me turn it over to David Zwiener and Ken Phelan for their assessment of Wachovia\u2019s third quarter results. ", "David Zwiener ", "Thanks, Bob. Today, I\u2019ll review our financial highlights, and then our Chief Risk Officer Ken Phelan, will discuss our loan portfolio and credit-related material. ", "First let me say that, while I\u2019ve been at Wachovia only a short time, it\u2019s been long enough to understand the potential of this franchise, with its exceptional people, commitment to customer service and cross-sell excellence, compelling geographic and demographic footprint, and attractive product set. Because of our shared values, we\u2019re enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead as we plan to join with our merger partner, Wells Fargo. ", "Beginning with Slide 1, it is clear that our results this quarter were greatly impacted by increasing credit costs, market disruption losses, lower overall asset valuations and subdued market activity. Additionally, our GAAP results included the recognition of $18.8 billion pretax of noncash goodwill impairment, which reflected declining market valuations and the terms of the merger with Wells Fargo. ", "On an operating basis we reported a loss of $4.8 billion, representing a loss of $2.23 per common share. In an attempt to provide clarity around the core trends driving these results, I will speak to our results excluding goodwill impairment, merger-related and restructuring expenses, intangible amortization, market disruption-related losses, our second quarter \u201908 non-cash SILO charge and our principal investing results.", "On that basis, our revenue was down 8% on a linked quarter basis.  Net interest income, which historically accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue, was down 5%, largely due to pressure from our capital and liquidity strategies, a deposit mix shift and higher non-performing assets, primarily in our Golden West Pick-a-Pay portfolio.", "Fees were down 10% excluding the principal investing and market disruption losses and while we saw growth in our traditional banking fees during the quarter, all market-related fees were lower on reduced origination activity and asset valuations.", "Our loan portfolio, excluding Golden West, which we refer to as our core portfolio, continued to perform relatively in line with our expectations.  However, the worsening economic backdrop, deteriorating trends within the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, and an updated expectation for further house price declines resulted in our posting a provision expense of $6.6 billion during the quarter.  This included a reserve build of $4.8 billion, 66% of which was attributable to the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, which Ken will cover in more detail later, but let me relate that the reserve now reflects a 22% cumulative loss expectation.", "Expenses were down 6% on a linked quarter basis, despite $497 million of costs relating to the previously announced auction rate securities settlement and reflected our initiatives to rationalize our business to the changing economic environment.  Qualitatively, despite all the turmoil, our teammates in our traditional bank continued to focus on serving customers, as evidenced by growth in net new checking accounts, retail CDs, Way2Save product sales, growth in online customers and transaction dollar values, and annuity and investment management sales.", "Our retail brokerage team also remains focused on serving clients, and I\u2019m pleased to report that we ended the quarter with the A.G. Edwards integration on track with stable financial advisor headcount.  The success of this business\u2019s customer-centric model can be seen in client assets, which have declined 16% since the merger versus a 24% decline in the S&P 500 over the same period.", "Slide 2 provides a more detailed account of our third quarter GAAP and operating loss.  I\u2019d like to make two points.  First, regarding the goodwill impairment, about two-thirds of the impairment relates to our retail and small business sub-segment.  In July, when explaining our second quarter goodwill impairment, which didn\u2019t include impairment in the retail small business sub-segment, we told you that we were not likely to have impairment in this sub-segment.  The unprecedented, almost unimaginable events of the third quarter and the consideration for our pending merger with Wells Fargo created a scenario that required goodwill impairment for that and other sub-segments which rendered our earlier prediction incorrect.  We have a detailed explanation of the goodwill in the appendix to these materials.", "Second, you will note we have provided two views of net interest margin, both the GAAP view as well as the margin adjusted for our second quarter non-cash SILO charge, which shows a decline of 21 basis points in the margin during the quarter.  I\u2019ll provide further detail on the drivers of the decline shortly.", "Of course, we\u2019d like you to see, as we do, the core earnings power of this franchise, and slide 3 lays out the notable items that reduce what otherwise would be a pre-tax, pre-provision bottom line of around $3 billion.  We\u2019ve outlined key items on this page that affected our results, and I\u2019ll provide more detail on the market disruption losses later.  For now, let me direct your attention to the table at the lower right where we lay out additional items that we believe are useful to note, as they put additional pressure on our results.", "The impact of the lower market valuations reduced our principal investing results by $446 million.  Additionally, the capital and liquidity strategies that we detailed for you last quarter had the effect of replacing higher-yielding assets with lower-yielding assets and reduced net interest income by an estimated $100 million and the margin by 10 basis points.  ", "Also during the quarter we experienced a deposit shift mix which pressured the margin by 5 basis points, and the ongoing impact of rising NPAs, primarily in the Golden West portfolio, hurt the margin by 4 basis points.  Combined, these items hurt core revenues by about $690 million in the quarter.  Adjusting for these headwinds, our normalized results would be more in line with our pre-tax, pre-provision, pre-notable item results for the first two quarters of 2008.", "The next slide shows the impact on loan growth from our actions to preserve and protect capital.  In addition to our capital efficiency strategies, which included securitization activity and reducing single service commercial exposures, our results reflect the realities of a tightening credit environment.  We have deployed a number of strategies to appropriately reduce unfunded exposures.  We did see the effect of slower prepayment speeds and some up-tick in utilization of credit lines rather than new originations.  Specifically in our home equity portfolio, we saw utilization rise from 33% to 36% and in our large corporate book from 26% to 32%.", "Bob talked last quarter about our liquidity strategy regarding retail CDs.  You can see the success of that strategy on slide 5, with 13% growth in average balances on a linked quarter basis.  But results also reflect the effect of market turmoil on our deposit base.  Overall, average core deposits were relatively stable, as consumer core deposit growth of 9% year over year and 4% on a linked quarter basis offset the sizable and abrupt end of quarter outflows in commercial core deposits.", "However, it\u2019s important to point out that period-end core consumer deposits increased 6% year over year, net new checking account sales continued to be robust at 208,000 during the quarter, and our Way2Save campaign continued to exceed expectations.  41% generated a new checking account, and we ended the quarter with $328 million in new checking account balances as a result of this campaign.", "While we experienced significant pressure on our higher cost commercial deposits given the uncertainties following the WaMu announcement since quarter end we have begun to see our commercial deposit trends improve due to our clients\u2019 confidence in our merger partner as well as excellent customer service in our global banking group.", "As you can see on slide 6, fee income was down significantly as unprecedented uncertainty in market conditions weighed heavily on valuations and overall activity levels.  However, you can see that our traditional banking business continued to perform well, with fees in positive territory.  I\u2019ll go over the impact of market conditions on our market-related businesses next.", "Lower retail brokerage commissions on a linked quarter basis reflected a notable decline in daily transaction volumes which was felt industry-wide.  Also, fiduciary and asset management fees reflected not only market pressures but the effect of a shift in brokerage from market funds to insured deposits.  As I previously mentioned, principal investing losses were $310 million this quarter versus a gain of $136 million on a linked quarter basis and securities losses were approximately $2 billion, most of which were due to impairments.", "Now let\u2019s turn to slide 7, where you can see that impairment losses in capital management and the parent drove market disruption-related losses in the third quarter.  In our corporate and investment bank, losses of $940 million were up on a linked quarter basis despite lower distribution exposures and because of the lack of the second quarter benefit of $438 million on resolution of unfunded leverage finance positions, but these losses were down 40% from the first quarter.", "The losses in capital management were driven by impairment and trading losses of $851 million, relating largely to previously disclosed support of Evergreen Funds as well as auction rate security losses of $80 million.", "Securities impairment losses on the investment portfolio in the parent were $619 million.  Also at the bottom of this table you can see the totals for legal costs and sundry expense attributed to our auction rate securities settlement with regulators.", "Turning to our businesses, beginning with the general bank on slide 8, let me direct your attention to the table at the bottom left which illustrates the general bank results excluding mortgage.  You can see linked quarter and year over year that good sales momentum and strict attention to costs drove solid revenue and expense performance.  However, this strength was more than offset by rising credit costs due to the worsening economy.  I\u2019m very impressed with the continued efforts of this team to serve our customers in the face of market pressures, and you can see this in the continued solid customer satisfaction and loyalty scores.", "The challenging conditions also affected our wealth management results, as you can see on slide 9.  While the market turmoil led to deposit outflows, loans were stable and fiduciary and asset management fees and insurance commissions were higher.  I\u2019d also like to point out that while bottom line results were down on a linked quarter basis, they were up a solid 5% year over year due to this business\u2019s adoption of a new managed account basis client model in 2007.", "Of course, hardest hit were the market-related businesses in our corporate and investment bank.  As you can see on slide 10, expenses were up significantly, but we believe our expense reduction plans remain on track.  FTE reductions exceeded our previous estimates.  CIB was a key focus of our balance sheet reduction strategies, and they executed well against their target, despite market conditions that drove the increasing line utilizations at the end of the quarter.", "Turning to slide 11, our capital management business grew net interest income nicely on retail brokerage deposit growth and spread expansion.  Fees suffered in the market turmoil, including the market disruption losses described earlier.  But once again, we saw good expense discipline in capital management.  Excluding auction rate securities costs, our retail brokerage posted an adjusted pre-tax margin of 25.8%.", "We\u2019re extremely pleased to report solid progress in A.G. Edwards integration activity, which is now more than 50% complete.  On a linked quarter basis, series 7 headcount remained stable, with an increase in more productive financial advisors.  We also continued to see good cross-sell activity with general bank deposits in the quarter.", "Now let me turn this over to our Chief Risk Officer, Ken Phelan, for details on the loan portfolio and credit.", "Kenneth Phelan", "Thanks, Dave.  First off, I want to point out that while our credit costs are up significantly, reflecting continued weakness in the residential market and particular weakness in our Golden West portfolio, the balance of our portfolios appear fairly solid given the backdrop of the market and the rapid deterioration in the credit markets.", "As you can see from slide 13, total credit costs for the quarter were $6.6 billion, consisting of net charge-offs of $1.87 billion and an increase in our reserve of $4.8 billion.  Of the total credit costs, nearly two-thirds or $4.2 billion related to the Golden West Pick-a-Pay portfolio: $810 million from charge-offs, and $3.4 billion of reserve build.  I will discuss the Golden West Pick-a-Pay portfolio after first going over the core consumer and commercial loan portfolio, which we\u2019ve broken out on the right-hand side of the table on page 13.", "Our core loan portfolio performance is in line with expectations given the economic environment.  NPAs on this portfolio are up $1.1 billion, or 32 basis points, to $6 billion or 1.65% of loans.  The core loan portfolio provision of $2.4 billion includes a reserve build of $1.3 billion.  This reserve build included an increase of $576 million for the largely branch-originated consumer real estate portfolio, $132 million for autos, $214 million for commercial, and an unallocated increase of $440 million.  We leave the quarter with $7 billion allowance for credit losses on this portfolio, or 1.92% of loans, up $1.2 billion from the second quarter.", "Moving away from provisions to performance, on slide 14 we focus on the performance of the core consumer loan portfolio, where NPAs were up $371 million to 1.23% of loans, due to increased stress in the consumer real estate.  Charge-offs were up $169 million or 45 basis points of loans, in line with expectations.  Included in this amount were higher consumer real estate losses driven by $51 million in increased charge-offs from the CIB non-branch originated portfolios.  Charge-offs in the auto loan portfolio were up $60 million, reflecting some seasonality but largely driven by weakness resulting from stressed housing markets as well as increased severities driven by the large engine/V8 type models.  We also charged off $26 million in student loans based on the bankruptcy of one large insurer.  ", "Consumer past dues are up but outperforming industry averages. Traditional mortgage 90 plus days past due are one-half that of the industry average at 1.2% versus 2.39%.  Second lien home equity 60-plus days past due are one-third of the industry average, at 0.75% versus 2.03%.  Auto 30-plus days past due are three-quarters that of the industry average, at 2.89% versus 3.77%. Slide 15 graphically illustrates that our traditional mortgage and second lien home equity portfolios continue to significantly outperform the industry.", "Expanding on that last point, the next slide shows that our traditional mortgage product is performing relatively well.  This $41.6 billion portfolio is solid, branch-originated product with a current average LTV of 72% and an average current FICO score of 732, virtually unchanged from the portfolio\u2019s at-origination statistics.  Charge-offs were up $19 million or 19 basis points.", "Very different results have been experienced in the much smaller $1.95 billion CIB non-branch portfolio.  These mortgage loans are largely Alt-A loans that were originated for distribution.  In this portfolio, NPAs were $333 million at the end of the quarter, up $71 million quarter over quarter, and charge-offs were $48 million to 9.53% of average loans.", "A similar story can be told for our traditional home equity portfolios, where 95% of the portfolio was customer relationship-based and originated through direct channels.  As shown on slide 17, NPAs are up 25 basis points since the second quarter \u201808, driven by increases in stressed geographies and net charge-offs are up $4 million or 2 basis points.  As we saw within mortgage, the non-branch originated home equity portfolio in CIB performed significantly worse than branch-originated product and had charge-offs of $15 million or 15.88%.", "Slide 18 shows the managed auto portfolio performance, which had losses of 2.82%, up 86 basis points quarter over quarter.  As I mentioned previously, the increase in losses reflects some seasonality but is largely the result of weakness attributed to the retail housing markets and higher severities.  NPAs are up $27 million or 10 basis points to 34 basis points.", "We continue to pursue a number of risk mitigation strategies including ongoing focus on prime credit originations; newer originations with an average FICO score of 673; average LTV of new originations continuing to decline; reducing extended term, i.e. seven-year loans; a goal for 2% of originations from a high of 6.5%; collection systems upgrade resulting in improved response times.", "I want to focus for a moment on the commercial loan portfolio, excluding real estate financial services, or the REFS portfolio, which we\u2019ve highlighted for a number of quarters now and which I will discuss in more detail on the following slide. Despite the deterioration in the overall economy, this loan portfolio continues to perform as expected.  We have highlighted this view of the commercial portfolio in the bold section of the table on the left-hand side.  Commercial NPAs, excluding REFS, were up $133 million in the quarter, reflecting four large credits tied to the consumer spending and residential construction-related sectors.  Commercial charge-offs were up $47 million, or 11 basis points, driven by modest increases in large corporate and middle market.", "While I would note that our total commercial loan portfolio past due performance actually improved on a linked quarter basis with a 30 to 89 days past due down 10 basis points to $695 million, and the 90-plus past dues down 4 basis points or $81 million to $152 million, continued deterioration in the economic environment, particularly related to consumer spending and additional pressures from the housing market led us to build commercial reserves this quarter.  Allowance as a percentage of commercial loans increased 6 basis points quarter over quarter to 1.35%.", "Now to our commercial real estate REFS portfolio found on slide 20.  Period end outstandings declined modestly as we continued to focus on appropriate risk-based pricing and restructuring our residential-related exposures, ending the quarter at $10.9 billion.  The residential component of the portfolio is certainly most at risk and was the driver of the performance in the quarter, accounting for 81% of the NPAs and 75% of the charge-offs.", "Following the fourth quarter 2007 and first quarter 2008 reviews of the residential portfolio, we underwent an intensive review of the income-producing portfolio in August, and the findings were not surprising or unexpected.  While there was minimal overall negative grade migration, we do anticipate weakness in this portfolio to escalate with worsening of the broader economy.", "Now to the Golden West Pick-a-Pay portfolio on slide 22.  As a reminder, it consists of 438,000 loans with a large concentration in California.  The average LTV at origination was 71% with a current LTV of 95%.  Trends reflect the continued effect of declining home values, particularly in stressed areas such as California and Florida.  NPAs are up $1.9 billion and charge-offs are up $302 million since the second quarter 2008.  There\u2019s deferred interest of $4.1 billion or 3.5% of the portfolio.  There are nearly 2,100 REO/REJ properties with an average time to sale of 66 days and 2008 year-to-date severity is 38% including selling costs.  ", "Earlier I mentioned a $3.4 billion reserve build for this portfolio, reflecting an expected cumulative loss of approximately 22% over the remaining life of the portfolio. The next slide 23 shows increasing delinquency roll rates and this, combined with lower cure rates, particularly in the later stage delinquencies, are important factors in our updated reserve model output.", "Slide 24, updates our reserve model, and as I just mentioned, 30% of the increase in cumulative loss output is driven by updated actual experience in our portfolio and 70% is attributable to our views on continued home price depreciation.", "Finally, the next slide discusses the losses expected to be incurred by the end of 2009.", "Moving on to slide 26, as we first disclosed last quarter, we were in the process of taking active steps to minimize the risk and maximize the value of this portfolio.  In July we began an aggressive customer outreach beta program that has current staff of 300 in sales and 385 in fulfillment to refinance these mortgages to keep people in their homes and reduce losses in the portfolio.  The program is primarily focused on approximately $77 billion of Pick-a-Pay loans that we believe may be eligible for refinance under FHA guidelines.  Although very early in the program, we\u2019re encouraged by the results we have seen.", "I think that recaps our credit review and I\u2019ll hand it back over to Dave.", "David Zwiener ", "Thanks, Ken. Once again, this was a very challenging quarter in unprecedented times, but one thing remained clear: Wachovia has an exceptionally attractive franchise, footprint and set of businesses. The dedication of our teammates in putting their customers\u2019 needs above their own is unmatched. We look forward to being able to leverage this great franchise with our merger partner, Wells Fargo.

Thank you for calling into the Wells Fargo fourth quarter 2008 earnings review pre-recorded call.", "Before we discuss our fourth quarter results, we need to make the standard securities law disclosure. In this call we will make forward-looking statements about specific income statement and balance sheet items and other measures of future results of operations and financial conditions including generally statements about future credit quality and losses and the expected financial and other benefits and opportunities of the Wachovia merger including assumed cost savings, revenue synergies, internal rate of return and GAAP earnings accretion and specifically statements that the risk reduction or de-risking actions taken in the fourth quarter will reduce the likelihood of future losses, that the acquisition of Wachovia will add significantly to the Wells Fargo earnings run rate upon full integration and that we expect the additional revenue opportunities from adding long-term loans and securities during the current credit cycle to last longer than the higher charge offs because of the duration of the loans and securities that as we reduce the higher risk and lower return assets of Wachovia we expect the combined net interest margin to move somewhat towards the Wells Fargo historic stand-along margin, that we are on track for similar or higher mortgage application volume for the first quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter 2008, that as customers refinance their mortgages at par we expect to recoup some of the mortgage warehouse write down, that we believe the combined Wells Fargo/Wachovia platform provides us with the ability to generate profitable growth, that until home prices stabilize we continue to expect higher losses in the home equity portfolio and that we feel good about our financial assumptions.", "Forward-looking statements give our expectations about the future. They are not guarantees and results may differ from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date.", "For a discussion of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, refer to our SEC filings including the 8K filed today which includes the press release announcing our fourth quarter results and the slides that accompany these pre-recorded comments. Also refer to our most recent annual report on form 10K and quarterly report on form 10Q filed with the SEC and to the information incorporated into those documents.", "John Stumpf, our CEO, will make some concluding comments but first Howard Atkins, our CFO will review the company\u2019s financial performance. A slide presentation to go along with Howard\u2019s comments is available on our website.", "Howard Atkins", "Thanks, Bob. 2008 was a year in which the financial landscape was fundamentally reshaped. The environment in which Wells Fargo operates continued to be challenging in the fourth quarter and if anything became even more difficult with the unexpected, abrupt and sharp decline in economic activity late in the quarter. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by the economy and dysfunctional markets, in some cases like higher charge offs adversely impacted and in other cases like higher mortgage applications positively impacted.", "In addition, we took numerous actions in the fourth quarter to reduce the risk, or as we like to say de-risk, the combined new balance sheet in preparation for the Wachovia acquisition. While some of these actions adversely impacted fourth quarter earnings, this de-risking will reduce the likelihood of losses in the future, improving the level and consistency of our performance going forward.", "To put the fourth quarter in context I\u2019d like to cover several topics.", "First, the fourth quarter represented a continuation of the same profitable growth in lending and deposit gathering that Wells Fargo has always been successful at and which, if anything, accelerated since the start of the credit crisis in mid-2007.", "Second, I will go over with you the balance sheet actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2008 to prepare for the next exciting stage of our growth; the acquisition of Wachovia which will create the premier coast to coast financial services organization and which we continue to believe will add significantly to the Wells Fargo earnings run rate upon full integration.", "I will then go over fourth quarter results and how the actions taken in the fourth quarter to de-risk the balance sheet impacted fourth quarter earnings and the resultant capital position of the new company. I will conclude with color on credit quality and various key loan portfolios of the two banks that have now come together.", "Wells Fargo is a diversified growth company that has always focused on providing a full range of financial services to all customers, consumers, small businesses, middle market commercial and large corporations. While many other banks and almost every other large bank retrenched from lending since the start of the credit crisis, Wells Fargo has remained open for business providing over half a trillion dollars in mortgage originations and new loan commitments to our consumer and commercial customers and on a net basis increasing on our balance sheet over $119 billion in loans and securities by year-end 2008.", "The opposite was the case during the irrational exuberance of 2006 to 2007 when asset spreads were at all time lows and were not priced for risk. At that time our asset levels were relatively flat, in fact declining in 2006, while other financial institutions were leveraging their companies in some cases growing by double digit rates at low or no economic return.", "We were building our capital in that period waiting for the dam to break and it sure did. We were also prepared to lose market share and in fact we lost, for example, mortgage market share because we maintained our disciplined lending standards throughout that period.", "In the last one and one-half years as others needed to retrench, Wells Fargo accelerated its growth, taking market share in our chosen markets, increasing the number of households and businesses we serve and actively working to build relationships that will last forever. Wells Fargo\u2019s growth in average earning assets, adjusted for acquisitions of 25% from the beginning of the credit crisis through year-end 2008 was the highest among our large bank peers and also the highest among the top 9 peers in the United States.", "In terms of just loans, Wells Fargo\u2019s acquisition adjusted 22% growth was the highest among our peers. Keep in mind that while Wells Fargo has been fully extending new credit we were simultaneously reducing high-risk loans including exiting indirect channels, tightening credit standards and pricing for risk.", "For example, our home equity portfolio was essentially flat and our auto portfolios were reduced during this same period. Essentially, we have been reducing higher risk transactional lending as we have been expanding business with our customers.", "In addition to increasing earning assets at a double digit rate since the start of the credit", "crisis, we also increased deposits at a double digit rate over this same period, up 13% adjusted for acquisitions, well above the peer group averages while having the lowest average cost of deposits among our peers.", "With the Wachovia acquisition, Wells Fargo has an 11.2% deposit market share, essentially tied for the highest in the nation with what is arguably the best distribution system across the country based on June 2008 deposits updated for subsequent acquisitions.", "As we indicated previously, Wachovia has roughly half of Wells Fargo\u2019s core deposits, even though they are roughly the same size as Wells Fargo. We look forward to working with the Wachovia salespeople to increase the base of core deposits in their region as well as increasing cross sell to existing Wachovia depositors.", "As we have consistently provided credit to our customers throughout the credit crisis, we continued to grow and build the franchise in the fourth quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter we extended $22 billion in new loan commitments, originated $50 billion in new residential mortgages and took $116 billion in new mortgage applications. We ended the year with a $71 billion unclosed pipeline, our largest pipeline since the second quarter of 2005.", "Core deposits increased 31% annualized linked quarter. Net new consumer checking accounts once again exceeded 6% annual growth, as has been the case every quarter since third quarter 2005. Our net new consumer checking growth in California exceeded our overall growth rate.", "For the fourth quarter, California grew at an 8.3% rate, up from a 6.5% average for the prior four quarters which we believe to be evidence of both our relationship driven strategy and a continuation of a flight to safety in the industry. We are also pleased to note that Wachovia\u2019s core deposits resumed growth in the fourth quarter following the merger announcement with Wells Fargo, increasing 10% un-annualized from the trough early in the quarter and increasing across all customer segments. Both consumer and commercial depositors returned to Wachovia during the quarter.", "As recently reported in the Wall Street Journal, most of our large bank peers shrank loans in the fourth quarter. Wells Fargo increased lending in the fourth quarter at a 10% annualized linked quarter growth rate, one of the few large banks in the country to actually increase loans.", "The result of consistently extending credit and building our franchise shows up in our accelerated top line growth. A metric such as pre-tax, pre-provision profit, in other words growth in revenue net of expenses, is relevant because it demonstrates the underlying earnings power of the franchise each year and over the long term apart from the up and down impacts of the credit cycle.", "Wells Fargo has typically grown pre-tax, pre-provision earnings at least 10% per year, except for 2006 when we were deliberately shrinking our balance sheet because we weren\u2019t getting paid enough to hold assets. As spreads have widened significantly during the credit crisis we have been able to accelerate growth at wider margins and, consequently, pre-tax, pre-provision profit growth last year accelerated to 18%.", "Relative to our peers, we have had the highest and most consistent growth in top line revenue net of expense growth over either 1 year or 5 year time periods. Adjusted for acquisitions, none of the large peers had positive pre-tax, pre-provision growth last year. Our relative performance is due to our faster loan and deposit growth as well as the fact that we have not had the revenue losses that all of our peers have had in connection with problems from covenant light leverage lending, structured investments, proprietary trading or market making in sub-prime or exotic securities because we have never had material exposure to those activities.", "Our solid pre-tax, pre-provision profit growth is largely fueled by strong revenue growth. In addition, we have grown revenues at a faster rate than expenses, creating positive operating leverage. In 2008, Wells Fargo grew revenues by 6.1% organically while reducing our expenses by 2%. None of our large bank competitors had positive operating leverage last year, adjusted for significant acquisitions.", "Our pre-tax, pre-provision performance has been driven in large part by strong growth in net interest income. For 2008, net interest income growth was 20% driven by both 17% earning asset growth and our industry leading net interest margin, 4.83% for the year. Net interest income grew to $6.7 billion in the fourth quarter, up 23% year-over-year with the margin widening further to 4.9%.", "While the credit cycle is producing higher credit costs, the same external environment has produced numerous opportunities to add attractively-priced, long-term loans and securities for those banks that have had the capacity and origination systems to do so, like Wells Fargo. In the last year, our growth in net interest income from expanding our balance sheet $4.2 billion has essentially covered the additional charge offs we have incurred in this same period.", "In effect, the opportunities from the credit cycle have offset pre-reserve build credit costs cumulatively in the last 18 months. While credit costs could remain high or elevated for a period of time, we would expect the additional revenue to last even longer given the duration of some of these assets.", "One of the reasons we have been able to grow net interest income at above peer rates is because our net interest margin has consistently been one of the highest among our peers. In 2008, our net interest margin was 4.83%, rising to 4.9% in the fourth quarter, generally around 200 basis points above margins earned by other large competitors.", "Note that Wachovia\u2019s stand alone net interest margin has been closer to the other large peers shown in slide 15. As a result, the net interest margin of our consolidated organization will by definition be lower than Wells Fargo\u2019s stand alone margin, although the combined margin of the two banks in the fourth quarter 2008 would still have been higher than any large peer.", "As we integrate Wachovia and reduce its higher-risk, lower-return assets over time, we expect to move the combined margin somewhat toward Wells Fargo\u2019s historically higher standalone margin. Keep in mind that while mathematically lower than Wells Fargo stand-alone, the new company\u2019s margin will be associated with nearly twice as many assets as Wells Fargo\u2019s stand-alone margin, benefiting net interest income.", "The main reason for Wells Fargo\u2019s high stand alone net interest margin is not only better long term asset yield, but more importantly our lower cost of deposits than the peers. At 0.91% in the fourth quarter of 2008, our average deposit cost on $368 billion of our average deposits remained lower than our peers, typically 25-50 basis points lower than our large peers on our entire base of deposits.", "The primary reason for this is the proportionately higher percentage of non-interest bearing and low-interest demand and savings accounts in the mix of total deposits that we have accumulated and maintained over many years of successful cross selling and relationship building, as well as our ability to attract interest bearing deposits through our extensive store networks at lower cost than the competitors.", "We have already begun to conform Wachovia\u2019s deposit rates to Wells Fargo\u2019s in their geographic markets and so far deposit retention rates at Wachovia have exceeded our expectations. Our overall growth pattern continued in the fourth quarter. Let me describe the drivers in each of our main business lines.", "Regional banking had strong sales growth and cross sell, reflecting the continued focus on our vision of satisfying all our customers\u2019 financial needs and helping them succeed financially in all economic environments. Regional banking had core product sales of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter, up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2007. These sales results benefited from better penetration of Wells Fargo Packages, which include a checking account and at least three other products such as a debit card, credit card and savings account.", "Package sales were up 33% from the fourth quarter of 2007, purchased by 75% of all new checking account customers, up from 70% a year ago. Through acquisitions, not including Wachovia, and internal growth we added nearly 410,000 net new retail bank households in 2008, up 4%. Retail banking households have a record 5.73 products with Wells Fargo, up from 5.53 a year ago and up from around 3 at the time of the Norwest/Wells Fargo merger ten years ago.", "24% of our retail bank households had 8 or more products, our long-term goal. Lower consumer spending in the fourth quarter impacted card fees and purchase volume. On Wells Fargo consumer credit cards, purchase volume was down 2% from the fourth quarter 2007 and down 4% on a linked quarter basis. Debit card purchase volume was up 3% from the fourth quarter 2007 but down slightly on a linked quarter basis.", "We continued to have strong debit and credit card penetration of our retail bank households. 38% of Wells Fargo\u2019s retail bank consumer households had a Wells Fargo credit card, up from 27% five years ago and 92% of our consumer checking account customers had a debit card, up from 86% five years ago.", "Wachovia had much lower credit card penetration of 11% providing a natural growth opportunity for our card business in the future. Declining mortgage rates resulted in a surge in applications, $116 billion for the quarter, up 40% from third quarter. While 68% of applications during the quarter were for refis, almost $40 billion in new mortgage applications for purchased homes were taken in the quarter.", "Application volume for the month of December was the fourth highest month on record in what is traditionally a seasonally slow period for the industry and application volume during the first 14 business days of January have already exceeded those of the full month in January 2008 and indicates we are on track for similar or better application volume than in the fourth quarter.", "The mortgage pipeline ended the quarter at $71 billion including $5 billion from Wachovia, up from $41 billion at the end of the third quarter and the largest pipeline since the second quarter of 2005.", "Our total residential servicing portfolio grew 21% from a year ago to $1.8 trillion, including $271 billion from Wachovia. Reflecting the continued stress in the housing market, the foreclosure rate for the servicing portfolio continued to increase to 1.41% at quarter end which we believe was still better than the industry average. We continue to work closely with customers who face financial difficulties.", "Through repayment plans, modifications and other loss mitigation options we have delivered more than 143,000 solutions to customers in the fourth quarter alone. In 2008, we provided over 498,000 solutions to customers. We are working with government agencies, Hope Now and others and have led the industry in the development of programs for approximately 3 million at risk customers to avoid foreclosure.", "Also, just this week we announced the expansion of our leading the way home program, which offers solutions to prevent foreclosure. By expanding our efforts to Wachovia, approximately 470,000 customers, including those with Pick a Pay loans, will have access to the program if they face payment challenges. Through our active communication programs, Wells Fargo home mortgage has reached 94% of its customers who are two or more payments past due.", "For every 10 of these customers we have worked with seven on a solution, two declined help and one could not be reached. Of those who received a loan modification, one year later approximately 7 of every 10 were either current or less than 90 days past due.", "Mortgage non-interest income in the fourth quarter included a $413 million write down due to additions to the repurchase reserve and a write down of aged mortgage warehouse loans due to spread widening on limited quotes in the secondary market. As customers refi at par old mortgages we are holding in the warehouse we expect to recoup some of that write down.", "The impact of interest rates on origination and servicing non-interest income was a net positive of $7 million reflecting a net valuation loss of $346 million on MSR\u2019s net of hedges, a $328 million loss due to the impact of interest rate changes on the pipeline/warehouse values net of hedge results which was reported in mortgage origination gains offset by $681 million in net gains on debt securities that were hedging the MSR\u2019s reported in gains on debt securities available for sale.", "We also had strong sales during the quarter in business banking with store based sales to our small business customers up 23% compared to fourth quarter 2007. Business banking households have a cross sell of 3.61 products per household. Sales of Wells Fargo Business Services packages, which include a business checking account and at least three other business products such as a business debit card, credit card or business loan or line of credit, were up 36% in the fourth quarter and were purchased by a record 51% of new business checking account customers.", "Our Wealth Management Group, serving our high net worth customers, achieved 10% revenue growth and 20% growth in pre-tax, pre-provision profit from the fourth quarter 2007. Net income was negatively impacted by a charge off of $294 million pre-tax related to clients who were impacted by the Madoff fraud.", "Average core deposits were up $7 billion or 40% from a year ago and increased 32% annualized from the third quarter of 2008. Wealth Management customers continued to place a premium on safety and quality when choosing where to place their financial assets.", "Private Banking, serving our highest net worth customers, grew revenue by over 50% from the fourth quarter of 2007. In the fourth quarter, Private Banking grew average core deposits by 38% and average loans by 27% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Wells Trade, our online brokerage service, had double digit revenue and net income doubled and continued to attract and retain customers with account levels up 12% from last year.", "Our wholesale and commercial banking business, which serves primarily middle market customers and the large corporate market from coast to coast, continued to have strong loan and deposit growth as Wells Fargo has remained open for business during a time when others have pulled back or exited from commercial lending.", "Wholesale banking\u2019s average loans increased 30% from fourth quarter of 2007 as we continued to have more opportunities to increase business with new and existing customers at improved credit spreads and with better structures. Loan growth was broad based across many of our commercial businesses including double digit growth in asset based lending, middle market lending, commercial real estate and specialized financial services which includes our capital markets activities and relationships with Fortune 500 companies.", "Wholesale banking\u2019s average core deposits grew 18% from fourth quarter last year and 26% from third quarter. This growth was strong in both interest bearing and non-interest bearing deposits reflecting the benefit from a flight to quality and the continued success of our relationship based model and national presence. By continuing to focus on our relationship model, wholesale banking increased cross sell to a record 6.4 products per customer relationship, up from 6.1 products a year ago.", "Our middle market customers now have 7.8 products per relationship and U.S. corporate banking, serving Fortune 500 companies has an average cross sell of 7.6 products per relationship. This relationship focus will remain at the center of the integration of the wholesale businesses in the merger with Wachovia. The increased scale in many products will benefit customers across the country.", "For example, in our mutual fund business Wells Fargo increased its rank from 18th a year ago to 14th in the fourth quarter and including the combination with Wachovia\u2019s Evergreen funds we ranked 11th at year-end with a total of $254.5 billion in fund balances.", "Our recently closed acquisition of Wachovia is the next important stage of Wells Fargo\u2019s continued growth. On a combined basis, we now operate what we believe to be the nation\u2019s premier coast-to-coast financial services franchise. This status is achieved by both the physical reach of our company as well as through the leading presence we have in key lending, deposit and brokerage activities across the country. We firmly believe that this platform provides us with the ability to generate profitable growth for our shareholders in much the same way our prior, pre-acquisition business did for decades.", "We are now the number one in the U.S. in community banking presence, small business lending, middle market commercial banking, agricultural lending, commercial real estate lending, commercial real estate brokerage and bank owned insurance brokerage. We are number two in banking deposits in the United States, home mortgage originations and servicing, retail brokerage and debit card.", "Although we just closed the acquisition on December 31, our integration efforts have been underway since the deal was announced and we are on or ahead of schedule in most key areas of our merger.", "For example, our updated analysis throughout the fourth quarter of Wachovia\u2019s loan portfolios reconfirmed our comfort with the prior credit assumptions; senior leadership structure is in place, our respective teams have been exceptionally active in combining best practices to provide the best possible service to our expanded customer base and all major operating system decisions have now been made.", "All in all, we are very pleased with our progress and if anything are only more confident in the value of this merger. From an expense standpoint, approximately $74 million of merger and integration expenses have been taken through Wells Fargo\u2019s earnings in fourth quarter and a preliminary $199 million of expenses were taken through purchase accounting adjustments at the time of the merger.", "We are pleased with the progress Wachovia is making in returning to the business of lending to its retail and commercial customers and building deposits, which were up 10% un-annualized since the early fourth quarter trough.", "The efforts made by Wachovia to reduce asset risk prior to the actual merger exceeded our initial expectations. Through a combination of asset write downs, sales of investment and trading securities and reductions in higher-risk lending, Wachovia made great progress toward reducing exposures on non-relationship portfolios that Wells Fargo has indicated will not be part of the long-term business mix of the new company. In the process reducing loans, securities, trading assets and loans held for sale by $115.2 billion, or 17% since June 30, 2008, almost entirely in the fourth quarter.", "The asset run off underway at Wachovia was part of an overall effort to de-risk the two companies in preparation for the merger in order to reduce the potential losses that might have detracted from earnings growth going forward. The principal de-risking action was to identify and segregate what turned out to be $93.9 billion of higher risk loans on Wachovia\u2019s balance sheet and impair those loans through purchase accounting adjustments at close for the $37.2 billion of estimated life of loan losses.", "This is roughly consistent with our initial expectations and differs only in part because some of the originally estimated life of loan losses were already charged off in fourth quarter of 2008 or were essentially provided for in Wachovia\u2019s reserve build instead of purchase accounting as the mix of loans between impaired and non-impaired was ultimately finalized.", "Both Wachovia and Wells Fargo incurred costs in the fourth quarter related to credit de-risking. In addition to the $37.2 billion of credit marks on high risk Wachovia loans, which were taken as purchase accounting adjustments, Wachovia recorded through its earnings a $1.2 billion provision for fourth quarter charge offs in its Pick a Pay portfolio, largely for the pool of loans subsequently identified as high risk at close and a $4.2 billion credit reserve build.", "Wells Fargo built reserves by $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter to conform both bank\u2019s reserving practices to the more conservative of the two banks and also added $1.7 billion in reserves for projected credit deterioration. Apart from the $37.2 billion credit write down for impaired loans at Wachovia, the other items were charged to the respective earnings of the two banks.", "Each bank had a number of other significant items including write downs of securities and loans as well as merger and integration expenses. As a result, Wells Fargo reported a $2.5 billion loss in the fourth quarter. While we were disappointed to have reported a loss, the quarter included numerous de-risking and merger related items amounting to $6.9 billion pre-tax, including the $3.9 billion provision to conform reserve practices to the most conservative of each company; the $1.7 billion additional credit reserve build; a $413 million write down of loans in the mortgage warehouse and additions to the mortgage repurchase reserve; $473 million of other than temporary impairment securities write downs; $294 million of net charge offs related to the Madoff fraud and $74 million of merger-related costs.", "Had Wachovia remained a stand alone company it would have reported a loss of $11.2 billion in the fourth quarter which included a $2.8 billion deferred tax asset write down. Wachovia also had numerous significant items during the quarter including a reserve build of $4.2 billion and market disruption losses of $4.3 billion.", "The company\u2019s results were also dampened by the effect of declining market values on the market sensitive business model. Underlying business trends at Wachovia began to recover as we neared the second half of the quarter and we remain excited about the opportunities that still exist.", "Wachovia did see positive business trends throughout its consumer and commercial businesses as the customer base stabilized and deposit and checking accounts began to grow again and new customer acquisition metrics remained positive. Each major business segment at Wachovia experienced positive deposit growth including retail/commercial, wealth clients, brokerage and cash management during the quarter.", "Additionally, in the markets oriented businesses such as retail brokerage, sales of traditional banking products and were up and net inflows to Wachovia funds were up $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter versus a net outflow of $11.7 billion in the previous third quarter. Finally, net exposure in the investment bank to sub-prime, CMBS and leveraged loan assets ended the quarter down 85% from the prior year.", "Tier-1 capital was $86.4 billion at December 31, 2008 after the impact of de-risking the balance sheet for credit impairments of loans and write downs of negative cumulative other comprehensive income at Wachovia, which in the aggregate reduced the tier-1 capital ratio of the combined organization by approximately 230 basis points to 7.9% at year-end, still well above regulatory minimums for a well capitalized bank even after the de-risking actions.", "Another metric sometimes used to assess capital strength is the combination of tier-1 capital and the allowance for credit losses. For Wells, the combined amount of tier-1 capital and our $21.7 billion of allowance would approximate 9.4% of earning assets for the consolidated two banks and year-end 2008. That ratio is higher than Wells Fargo maintained on a stand alone basis at any point in the last six years other than 2006, a year in which Wells Fargo built excess capital by significantly reducing assets given the fact that asset spreads were not properly accounted for risk. We consider the capital position and allowance of the consolidated company to be a source of strength.", "Since credit is such an important part of the current picture let me now conclude with an overview of the various loan portfolios including Wachovia\u2019s major loan portfolios.", "The new Wells Fargo has a combined total of $129.5 billion in home equity loans and lines of credit at the end of 2008 including loans and lines of credit that were originated through the National Home Equity Group, Wachovia, Wells Fargo Financial and the Wealth Management Group.", "For reporting purposes, additions to the total reported portfolio at year-end are included within the core portfolio while the liquidating portfolio is reported on the same basis as prior quarters and is Wells Fargo only.", "The fourth quarter home equity loss rate on a combined basis, excluding the impaired home equity portfolio, was 2.87%, down from the Wells Fargo home equity loss rate of 3.09% in the third quarter, which included home equity loans originated in the National Home Equity group only.", "This improvement in loss rate reflects the higher quality of Wachovia\u2019s home equity portfolio which was predominately retail originated, about 98.8%, with a higher percentage of balances in the first-lien position than Wells Fargo\u2019s portfolio and with greater geographic diversity. About 20% of legacy Wachovia\u2019s Home Equity portfolio balance was in a first-lien position compared with approximately 13% for stand alone Wells Fargo.", "The addition of Wachovia\u2019s Home Equity portfolio actually improved the geographic diversification of the overall Home Equity portfolio since 74% of Wachovia\u2019s Home Equity portfolio is outside of California and Florida compared with 58% outside of California and Florida for the stand alone Wells Fargo Home Equity portfolio.", "The liquidating portfolio reported a fourth quarter loss rate of 8.27% up from 7.59% in the third quarter, reflecting the continued decline in home prices, higher levels of unemployment and the proportionately higher percentage of the portfolio at a combined current loan-to-value of greater than 90%.", "76% of this portfolio had a combined loan-to-value of greater than 90% at quarter-end based predominately on estimated home values from automated valuation models updated through December 2008. 40% of the core portfolio, excluding legacy Wells Fargo Financial and legacy Wells Fargo Wealth Management Group, had a combined loan-to-value of greater than 90%. The liquidating portfolio at December 31, 2008 was $10.3 billion, down from a peak of $11.9 billion a year ago. The higher risk home equity loans at Wachovia are reflected in the impaired portfolio with a beginning balance of $1.4 billion which were marked down 41% to $0.8 billion.", "Until home prices stabilize we continue to expect higher losses in the home equity portfolio. It is important to remember, however, that most of our home equity borrowers were current with their loans at quarter-end.", "Excluding the impaired home equity portfolio, about 2.48% of the portfolio balance were two or more payments past due compared to 2.29% at September 30, 2008 for the Wells Fargo stand alone portfolio.", "We continue to work aggressively with our customers to avoid problems and mitigate loss. During the fourth quarter our loss mitigation activities within the National Home Equity Group benefited nearly 4,400 customers with over $429 million in balances. By working with these customers and finding solutions to their financial difficulties we believe we will end up keeping more customers in their homes and mitigating loss.", "In addition to exiting most indirect home equity origination channels last year, we have been managing accounts to reduce risk while at the same time remaining open for business for credit worthy retail customers.", "As you may remember, Wells Fargo has never originated option ARM's and we are not going to start now. In fact, Wachovia\u2019s Pick a Pay portfolio is already in the process of being reduced as no new loans are made and existing loans mature, are modified or sold. However, we do believe that Wachovia\u2019s option ARM portfolio, or Pick a Pay, is the highest quality option ARM portfolio in the industry.", "After the effect of purchase accounting, the portfolio totaled $93.2 billion. $35.5 billion of the remaining portfolio are credit impaired loans which were marked down by 41% and represents the portion of the Pick a Pay portfolio we believe has the greatest probability of default.", "Estimated future losses for the impaired portion of the portfolio have already been recognized as a reduction in these loan balances pursuant to purchase accounting and will not be charged against future earnings. We are already using the mortgage company\u2019s expertise in mitigating losses with a test mailing to select Pick a Pay customers where we believe a loan modification may help keep them in their homes. This follows Wachovia\u2019s modification efforts last fall with the mark that we have taken on the portfolio providing us with more flexibility particularly on balance and rate adjustments.", "The portion of the Pick a Pay portfolio that we did not mark, $57.7 billion, has dramatically better credit performance and characteristics. For example, the 30 plus day delinquency ratio was only 10 basis points. Additionally, these borrowers have credit statistics that are more representative of Wachovia\u2019s remaining consumer real estate portfolio with an average current FICO of 712 and an average current LTV of 80% at quarter end.", "Within the first mortgage portfolio, Wells Fargo Financial had a total of $25 billion of debt consolidation loans originated through Financial\u2019s U.S. retail stores at quarter end, flat from the third quarter due to tightening underwriting standards, declining real estate values and less investment in their distribution network.", "The declining real estate values and increases in unemployment have resulted in higher delinquencies and charge offs in this portfolio with fourth quarter losses of $97 million, a 1.53% annualized loss rate. While losses and delinquencies increased they are still significantly better than published industry rates for non-prime mortgage portfolios.", "The better credit performance in our portfolio was due to our consistently tighter underwriting standards compared to other non-prime mortgage originators. The Wells Fargo Financial team members who underwrite these loans originated through the store network underwrite to the customer first and the collateral second. This portfolio does not include any interest-only, stated income, option ARM or negative amortizing loans. $12 billion of the debt consolidation portfolio is in ARM products. Almost 25% of the ARM portfolio is in the adjustable period and an additional 20% is scheduled to have its initial adjustment in 2009.", "Adjustable rates decreased for much of 2008 and if interest rates remain low loans scheduled to adjust in 2009 will, in fact, have lower monthly payments.", "Wells Fargo Financial\u2019s $24 billion auto portfolio declined 19% from last year reflecting tightened credit standards and car sales at a 26-year low. Net charge offs on the Wells Fargo Financial portfolio were up $55 million linked quarter, a 6.04% annualized loss rate reflecting seasonal trends, lower used car prices and the deterioration in the economy. Ninety days past due were up 11 basis points from the fourth quarter last year.", "Wachovia\u2019s $23.4 billion owned auto portfolio increased 4% year-over-year. While net losses in this portfolio are not included in Wells Fargo\u2019s results for the quarter, the annualized net charge off ratio on the owned portfolio was 3.7% in the fourth quarter. Ninety days past due increased 7 basis points from both the third quarter of 2008 and the fourth quarter of last year.", "Beginning January 1, indirect auto loans will be originated through Wachovia Dealer Services and Wells Fargo Financial will originate all direct auto loans. Approximately 90% of the combined auto portfolio was originated through indirect lending.", "Wells Fargo\u2019s Community Banking credit card portfolio had $13.7 billion in outstanding balances at quarter end, up 18% annualized from the third quarter and up 15% from a year ago. The growth of this portfolio has continued to slow, reflecting lower consumer spending and tighter underwriting standards. Losses in this portfolio continue to increase as a result of higher bankruptcy rates and higher unemployment.", "We proactively manage our existing accounts, including restricting balance growth and transactions on riskier accounts, lowering and in some cases closing credit lines and for a small percentage of accounts re-pricing them consistent with the customer\u2019s current risk profile. Since the vast majority of our bank card customers have other relationships with Wells Fargo, we monitor customer behavior using both internal and external measurements.", "Wells Fargo Financial had $7.8 billion in credit card balances at quarter end, up 5% annualized from the third quarter. These cards are sold primarily to Wells Fargo Financial customers and through retailers and manufacturers with large dealer networks, not through mass mailing campaigns. Wells Fargo Financial\u2019s card portfolio accounted for over half of the quarterly increase in consumer credit cards losses.", "Similar to the bank\u2019s credit card business, Wells Fargo Financial has continued to proactively manage new and existing accounts with tightened underwriting standards and by appropriately pricing for risk.", "Wachovia had only $2.5 billion in credit cards outstanding at the end of the quarter. The Wachovia card business model mirrors Wells Fargo\u2019s with cards sold only to banking customers. Wachovia\u2019s fourth quarter loss rate was in line with the loss rate on Wells Fargo\u2019s Community Banking card portfolio.", "Within our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio, we have an $11.7 billion Business Direct portfolio consisting primarily of unsecured small loans and lines of credit to small business owners nationwide with an average balance of less than $20,000. Business Direct\u2019s credit losses increased in the fourth quarter by $29.4 million from the third quarter. This increase is consistent with the higher losses experienced in our consumer portfolios.", "Wells Fargo had a total of $68 billion of commercial real estate and construction loans outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter, up 6% from the third quarter, including $32 billion managed by the Wholesale Banking Group. Charge offs were $93 million in the fourth quarter, or a 0.55% loss rate. Although the portfolio has shown some signs of stress the loss rates have remained at an acceptable level.", "Our real estate underwriting expertise has remained consistent through many prior cycles and continues to serve us well in this one. Within our commercial real estate portfolio, we had approximately $5.5 billion in residential, 1-4 family construction and land development loans. While losses in this portfolio increased due to the decline in the residential real estate market, losses remained within expectations because of the quality and experience of our people and our customers.", "Wachovia\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio totaled $70 billion including $45 billion managed by the real estate division after taking $7.7 billion of loan marks. We believe the loan marks taken in this portfolio were appropriate given the risk in the portfolio. Approximately $60 billion of the combined commercial real estate portfolio between the two banks is owner occupied commercial real estate.", "Let me now briefly summarize the loan portfolio for the combined company. On a combined basis we had $865 billion in loans outstanding as of December 31, 2008. There is more geographic diversity in this portfolio than either bank had prior to the merger and we have maintained our balance of commercial and consumer loans. The allowance for credit losses of $21.7 billion at year-end covered more than 320% of non-performing assets, the highest coverage ratio among large bank peers. The allowance covers 12 months of estimated losses for all consumer loans and at least 24 months for commercial loans.", "In summary, within the context of a challenging external environment, Wells Fargo remains an industry leader in providing credit to consumers and businesses extending over half a trillion dollars in new loan commitments and mortgage originations since the start of the credit crisis in mid-2007. Loan and deposit growth is driving significant and hopefully durable top line growth with pre-tax, pre-provision growth increasing 18% last year.", "We successfully closed the Wachovia acquisition on schedule, on plan on December 31, 2008. In preparation for the next stage in our profitable growth, numerous actions were taken by both banks in the fourth quarter that will reduce the potential for loss going forward. While these actions and other significant items resulted in a reported loss at both banks in the fourth quarter, the balance sheet of the combined organization was strengthened and the resultant de-risked capital position of the new organization remains strong.", "Let me now turn it over to John Stumpf, Wells Fargo\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, for some concluding comments.", "John Stumpf", "Thanks Howard. I just wanted to reiterate how enthusiastic we are about the future for Wells Fargo. With the completion of the Wachovia merger, we are one team, twice as strong. I feel better about this deal now than I did when it was first announced. I have met with thousands of Wachovia team members and customers all over the East Coast and the Southeast.", "These are really great people in really great markets. This merger is coming together better than we ever could have expected. While the economy is worse, no question about that, than when we announced the merger, we feel very good about our financial assumptions including 20% IRR and at least 20% accretive to GAAP earnings in year three, 30% on a cash basis. I also believe that our cost save projections were low and our conversion cost projections were high.", "The weakened economy is in many ways a benefit for bringing these companies together. Wachovia\u2019s talented team members are choosing to stay with the company in greater numbers than we anticipated. These are really terrific team members who are among the very best at serving their customers and customers that left Wachovia prior to the merger are coming back and are excited about giving Wells Fargo their business.", "Remember, we didn\u2019t include any revenue synergies in our models. So, while economic conditions are still uncertain we couldn\u2019t feel better about the future for Wells Fargo. I\u2019m also happy to report that today the Board of Directors declared a common dividend of $0.34 per share consistent with our prior dividend.", "Thank you for listening.

Atkins \u2013 Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Bob Strickland ", "This is Bob Strickland. Thank you for participating in the Wells Fargo second quarter 2009 earnings review pre-recorded call. Before we discuss our second quarter results, we need to make the standard securities law disclosure. In this call we will make forward-looking statements about specific income statement and balance sheet items and other measures of our future financial results and condition, including statements about future loss content of and cash flows from the legacy Wachovia impaired loan portfolios, expected credit losses and credit performance generally and in specific loan portfolios, the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, future levels of nonperforming assets, future levels of capital, the timing and amount of expected cost savings and business and revenue synergies related to the Wachovia merger and other initiatives, and our ability to generate revenue growth and earnings.", "These forward-looking statements are based on our expectations, and they are not guarantees of future performance. They speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date. Actual results may differ materially from expectations due to a number of factors, including our ability to successfully integrate Wachovia and realize the expected cost savings and benefits from the merger. There is no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover future credit losses, especially if credit markets, housing prices and unemployment do not stabilize or improve. For a discussion of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, refer to our SEC filings, including the Form 8K filed today, which includes the press release announcing our second quarter results, and our First Quarter 10Q and our 2008 annual report on Form 10K, each available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.SEC.gov.", "In this call we will also discuss our tangible common equity, tier I common equity and related ratios as well as pretax, pre-provision profit. For more information about these measures, refer to our second quarter earnings press release which is accessible on our website www.WellsFargo.com by clicking on about us, then investor relations, then quarter earnings. We\u2019ve also posted on our website a second quarter 2009 credit supplement that provides performance information for specific loan portfolios.", "I will now turn the call over to CFO Howard Atkins.", "Howard I. Atkins ", "Wells Fargo earned another record profit this quarter $3.17 billion. While many banks are struggling to earn consistent operating profits we\u2019ve had back-to-back quarterly record profits totaling $6.22 billion so far this year. Our second quarter profit which was up 81% from a year ago was after incurring a $565 million pretax FDIC special assessment, $244 million of merger related costs and a $700 million credit reserve build.", "The strength of our results should not be particularly surprising. Wells Fargo has a long track record of building its franchise in all economic environments by profitably growing its 80 plus businesses and this quarter was no exception. In fact, the number of businesses that contributed to the overall result was even larger and even more broad based than usual. We saw strong contributions from businesses as diverse as regional and commercial banking, mortgage originations and mortgage servicing, investment banking, wealth management, card services, insurance and international.", "Of our 30 or so largest businesses, more than half produced revenue growth of at least 8% annualized sequentially, the broadest mix of businesses with such strong growth in at least the last two years. In addition to the profits that come from successfully executing our uniquely diverse and well positioned business model, we are gaining new customers, gaining more of our existing customers business and gaining market share in any businesses. This inflow of new customers and additional business has the potential to continue to add to earnings well beyond the turn in the credit cycle.", "We also are beginning to benefit from the business synergies and new opportunities we have from acquiring Wachovia which has already begun to add to our earnings. Our earnings this quarter were driven by numerous accomplishments including the following: record revenue up 28% annualized from the first quarter; record retail bank household cross sell of Wells Fargo products of 5.84 products; and wholesale cross sell of 6.4 products at legacy Wells Fargo.", "At legacy Wells 41% of retail bank households have over six products with us and one out of every four retail bank households now have at least eight products with us. A 14% increase on regional bank and core product sales of legacy Wells Fargo from the prior year on a comparable basis. $194 billion in new mortgage applications, up from $190 billion in the first quarter; the second quarter was the second best mortgage applications quarter in our company\u2019s history indicating potentially good origination levels in to the third quarter.", "A 20% annualized increase in combined average checking and savings deposits from the first quarter which now represent 80% of total core customer deposits, arguably the best deposit base among large banks in the world. Over $206 billion of new credit extended to customers in the second quarter. Wells Fargo has extended more credit than any other bank in the United States this year through May 2009 including mortgage securities purchased. 8% increase in wealth brokerage and retirement services client assets from the prior quarter, over $1 trillion of client assets. Net interest margin of 4.3%, the best among large banks, up 14 basis points from the first quarter. Pretax, pre-provision profit of $9.8 billion, up 27% annualized due to revenue growth and disciplined expense management.", "Pretax, pre-provision profit which is total revenue less non-interest expense was double credit losses in the quarter, another illustration of our ability to earn through the current credit cycle. Reflecting the diverse nature and competitive advantages of our business model, our pretax, pre-provision profit has remained well above cyclically high charge offs and has accelerated through much of the last two years.", "Our earnings were well balanced in the second quarter reflecting the overall quality of our record results. Total revenue earned in the quarter was roughly split equally between spread income and fee income and driven by both retail and commercial businesses. Wachovia and legacy Wells Fargo each contributed to the overall record $22.5 billion of revenue, about 39% from Wachovia.", "To give you some idea just how broad based the results were, I will elaborate on several of the businesses that grew revenue in the quarter. Wells Fargo remains one of the largest providers of credit to the United States economy. In the second quarter we extended $206 billion in new credit to our consumer and commercial customers for a total of $917 billion since the start of the credit crises in mid 2007. While loan demand has moderated in the last two quarters as consumers and businesses reduce their debt, the facilities we have extended represent an important source of liquidity to our customers and an important source of fee income to Wells Fargo. Loan and commitment fees in the quarter were up 6% annualized from the first quarter.", "We continued to experience very strong core deposit growth particularly in checking and savings accounts. While macroeconomic factors such as the money supply growth and higher consumer savings rates are having a positive impact on deposit growth in the industry, we believe we are gaining share as we add customers and build deposit relationships in retail, commercial and wealth management. Average core deposits of $766 billion in the quarter were up 6% annualized from $754 billion in the first quarter.", "During the quarter $24 billion of higher rate Wachovia CDs matured and we retained $14 billion of these deposits in lower cost checking and savings accounts or lower rate CDs. Consumer checking accounts were up a net 5.5% for the overall company and up a net 6.5% at legacy Wells Fargo from the prior year. California continued to outperform our other banking states with a net 9.5% increase in consumer checking accounts benefitting from our strong competitive position in the state and from growth at Wachovia stores.", "We also had strong growth in small business checking accounts, especially in Wachovia\u2019s retail banking franchise. Small business checking accounts were up a net 3.9% throughout Wells Fargo and up a net 6.2% at Wachovia from the prior year benefitting from a small business marketing campaign. Our deposit base is arguably the best among large banks with approximately 10% of the nation\u2019s deposits at Wells Fargo. About 80% of our core deposits are in checking or savings accounts, among the highest of our large bank peers based on first quarter data.", "This is a major driver behind our industry leading net interest margin. We have several competitive advantages in being able to attract and maintain more low costs deposits. First, our long term focus on capturing the primary checking account relationship has provided a gateway to increased cross sell and balance retention. On average our retail checking account customers have five additional products with legacy Wells Fargo which increases our success in retaining these checking account balances.", "As the nation\u2019s number one small business lender as well as the number one SBA lender including Wachovia, we also focus on serving the checking account needs of our small business and business banking customers which also drives our higher balances. Finally, our strong distribution network and the convenience it offers is key to meeting the needs of our existing checking account customers and attracting new retail and business customers.", "Wells Fargo Home Mortgage had its third best originated quarter in its history, $129 billion in the quarter, up 28% from the first quarter. Mortgage applications in the second quarter were $194 billion, up $4 billion from the first quarter application rate. Applications for home purchases almost doubled in the quarter reflecting increased purchase activity in some markets, like California, where lower home prices and lower mortgage interest rates have substantially improved affordability.", "Despite the increase in mortgage rates late in the second quarter, the mortgage pipeline ended the quarter at a relatively high $90 billion. The managed mortgage servicing portfolio increased 38% from a year ago to $2.2 trillion. The servicing side of the mortgage business not only has good fee income growth and economies of scale but, it also represents an important source of cross sell opportunities. As mortgage rates rose 72 basis points during the quarter, we wrote up the mortgage servicing rights asset by $2.3 billion while writing down the value of the offsetting hedge by $1.3 billion.", "The hedge generated solid carrying income due to the low level of short term rates which we expect will continue in the third quarter. Future hedge results however will also depend on the amount of servicing that is hedged and the composition of the hedging instruments. The ratio of MSRs to loans serviced for others was 91 basis points at quarter end down from 137 basis points a year ago. The average note rate was only 5.74%, the lowest rate in over three years.", "Card fees grew 33% annualized from first quarter on higher volumes, not by raising the fees we charge our customers. Our credit card business is relationship based, primarily sold to existing banking customers as a means of deepening the relationship. We intentionally have kept our fees constant while others in the industry have increased customer fees. Linked quarter purchase volume on credit cards was up 26%. Some of this growth was seasonal but also reflects increased customer usage and new customer growth including new private label dealers at Wells Fargo\u2019s financial retail sales finance business.", "While credit losses on credit cards remain elevated, the business remains profitable. We have a great opportunity to cross sell credit cards to the Wachovia customer base. Currently 15% of Wachovia\u2019s retail bank customers have a credit card with us compared with 36% penetration at legacy Wells Fargo. The National Credit Card Act will benefit some credit card customers by eliminating practices such as double cycle billing and universal default. Wells Fargo did not engage in any of the practices that the Act is addressing however, other aspects of the Act will likely result in further credit tightening and general increases in the cost of consumer credit.", "Wealth, brokerage and retirement services posted a strong second quarter driven by 13% linked quarter revenue growth and positive operating leverage. Client assets reached $1.1 trillion at quarter end, up 8% from the first quarter. We also had strong growth in deposits, up 11% from the first quarter. As retail investors waded back in to the markets in the second quarter, we were able to help them with their investment needs.", "Through our retail securities brokerage business, we\u2019ve managed to count assets up 16%. Our 22,000 registered representatives now have full access to Wells Fargo suite of deposit, mortgage, trust and other banking products for their clients. Second quarter saw a record mortgage origination volume through this channel, another example of new cross sell and revenue synergies with Wachovia. We expect additional cross sell as we integrate our home equity, small business financing, business lending, equipment financing, credit card and other platforms to our brokerage business in the coming quarters. Year-to-date we have recruited nearly 1,000 experienced financial advisors and on average the business productivity of the new financial advisors is 60% higher than those who left.", "Our retirement services business also benefited from improved market conditions and higher net inflows with retirement plan assets up12% to $250 billion and IRA assets up 10% to $212 billion from the first quarter. With the acquisition of Wachovia Dealer Services, Wells Fargo is not the second auto lender in the country. Revenue in this business is up 7% from the first quarter driven by portfolio growth and widening spreads. Two years ago Wells Fargo\u2019s auto business was underperforming and we purposely put the brakes on the growth in this business.", "Today, we\u2019re extremely pleased with the performance of Wachovia Dealer Services with the expertise acquired from Westcorp., it\u2019s one of the best run auto businesses in the country with an exceptional management team that understands how to operate a profitable auto business. This strong team combined with the corporate strength of Wells Fargo and capabilities across the retail and commercial auto business is producing excellent results and gaining market share.", "Investment banking revenue increased 29% from the first quarter. This business combines the best of the two companies advisory, financing and securities distribution capabilities to provide a range of essentially fee based investment banking and securities placement services. On top of that, we have one of the most attractive bases of corporate and commercial relationships in US banking. The skill and scale we now have in this business allows us to profitably participate in the customer advisory and customer flow aspects of investment banking.", "Asset based lending revenues grew 13% from the first quarter. This group of businesses includes Wells Fargo Foothill, Wells Fargo Business Credit, Wells Fargo Trade Capital and Wachovia Capital Finance. Asset based lending typically produces strong results in tougher economic environments by providing our commercial customers creative financing alternatives to more traditional bank lines and other sources of capital. Margins continue to widen and we continue to increase share in this business as competitors struggle or exit the business. Asset based lending is also benefitting from the enhanced investment banking platform gained through the merger with Wachovia. We\u2019ve had more chances to compete for and win lead positions in larger credit facilities creating additional fee income. \u2018", "Our international business also produced strong linked quarter revenue growth up 16% annualized from the first quarter. Our global payments business was acquired with Wachovia, generated 14% growth from the first quarter in international fees from its business of processing US dollar payments from overseas banks. This represents a substantial turnaround from the second half of last year when volume in the business was reduced as global bank customers reacted cautiously to market conditions in the United States. With the assurance of the strength of Wells Fargo behind this business, these customers returned this year. In addition, our foreign exchange revenues were up 14% on a linked quarter basis where volatile currency markets continued to drive greater customer demand for risk management solutions.", "The Wachovia acquisition is proceeding as expected. 39% of consolidated revenue in the second quarter came from Wachovia. Revenue synergies between legacy Wells Fargo and Wachovia are emerging in both directions and are ahead of expectations. For example, we\u2019ve successfully leveraged the distribution capabilities of Wachovia Securities with Wells Fargo\u2019s extensive commercial and corporate relationships to earn more bond and equity origination mandates.", "In our mortgage business, some of our near record volume of mortgage applications is the result of Wells Fargo mortgage reps working with Wachovia customers to help them finance or refinance a home. New revenue opportunities from the Wachovia acquisition are potentially significant. For example, while Wachovia as a similar number of retail banking stores and about 10 million retail bank households, Wachovia\u2019s retail bank household cross sell of Wachovia\u2019s products is currently 4.55 compared with legacy Wells Fargo retail bank cross sell of Wells Fargo products of 5.84.", "So, increasing the cross sell of Wachovia retail bank households just to the legacy Wells Fargo levels will provide an opportunity to increase the number of products held by Wachovia customers by over 25%. This opportunity extends across many products, for example, 14% of legacy Wells retail bank households have either a Wells Fargo or Wachovia mortgage compared with 9.5% of Wachovia\u2019s retail bank households. 36% of legacy Wells retail bank households have a credit card with us compared with around 15% at Wachovia. Around 80% of legacy Wells Fargo retail bank households have a debit card compared with only around 60% at Wachovia.", "In addition to these revenue synergies, we are on track to achieve $5 billion of annual run rate expense savings when the integration is completed which is scheduled to occur in 2011. We have begun to realize those savings in the first two quarters of the integration although merger and integration charges have largely offset the consolidation savings so far.", "Let me now turn to credit quality which performed in line with our expectations. Our credit losses increased during the quarter as expected but, the rate of increase slowed in many of our consumer portfolios. We also saw some signs of stabilization in early stage delinquencies in certain consumer portfolios. At legacy Wells Fargo, seven portfolios including credit card and business direct had a decline in 30 days past due in the second quarter compared with the first. While this trend may not continue, we believe it reflects the actions we\u2019ve taken in tightening credit standards over the past 24 months.", "Other portfolios such as commercial continue to show higher losses but from historically low levels. Losses throughout our portfolios will continue to be driven by unemployment and real estate values. But, with the purchase account marks we took on Wachovia\u2019s portfolios and the actions we\u2019ve taken to reduce risk throughout our portfolios, we are encouraged by have they have performed during these challenging economic times.", "We once again provided a lot of detail on our individual loan portfolios in our credit supplement this quarter which is available in the investor relations section of our website. I\u2019d like to highlight two of our portfolios, the commercial real estate and pick-a-pay portfolios. We provide commercial real estate loans to businesses large and small. Our $137 billion commercial real estate portfolio is well diversified by property type and geography. As expected, losses throughout our commercial real estate portfolio are increasing from historically low levels. However, we also firmly believe that our relationship focus and prudent credit discipline builds inherently higher quality in to the CRE loan book compared with the rest of the industry.", "Our commercial real estate loans are primarily originated through two key channels, $77.8 billion are in the wholesale banking group which originates both larger and more complex CRE loans in our real estate banking group as well as loans to medium sized customers in our middle market real estate group and our commercial banking group. At Wells Fargo, a seasoned and experienced credit risk management team is responsible for maintaining credit discipline. We believe this is the best team in banking and we continue to benefit from their deep experienced gained from managing through several previous tough credit cycles.", "The loans originated at Wachovia that were included in the impaired portfolio are being aggressively managed by a dedicated team focused on mitigating risk and losses utilizing a variety of asset restructuring, disposition and work out strategies. While the loss rates on the impaired portfolio have been significantly higher than our core wholesale CRE portfolio, they are generally performing as we had anticipated and as previously indicated estimated life of loan losses in Wachovia\u2019s CRE portfolio were already written down at close. The $50 billion of CRE loans originated through the community banking group have a smaller average loan size and are geographically diverse. Approximately half of those loans are owner occupied.", "While credit losses throughout our CRE portfolio are increasing from historically low levels, unlike the residential real estate market, and for that matter the commercial real estate market of the early 90s, we\u2019re not dealing with an outsized overbuilt market. While the size of our portfolio has remained relatively flat, reflecting lower demand, we continued to originate high quality loans at improved terms and spreads.", "The pick-a-pay portfolio also performed as expected as we continued to derisk the portfolio. I\u2019d like to highlight some key points that are important for every investor to understand about this portfolio. First, not all option ARM portfolios are alike and we believe we have the best portfolio in the industry. While recently reported industry data as of April 2009 indicates 37% of all industry option ARM loans are at least 60 days past due, our portfolio is performing significantly better with only 18% 60 days or more past due as of June 30th.", "Not surprisingly, our non-impaired portfolio is performing significantly better than our impaired portfolio with only 4.7% 60 days or more past due. In fact, 92% of the non-impaired portfolio is current compared with 62% of the impaired portfolio. In addition, while many other option ARM loans have recast periods as short as five years, our pick-a-pay loans generally have 10 year contractual recasts. As a result, we have virtually no loans where the terms recast over the next three years allowing us more time to work with borrowers as they weather the current economic downturn.", "Second, we continue to reduce the size of this portfolio with a total of $90 billion outstanding, down $3 billion from the first quarter and down $5 billion from yearend. This reduction reflects loans paid in full, loss mitigation efforts and the fact that we are not originating any new loans of this type. Third, we have been very active in assisting customers in modifying loans, completing 22,200 loan modifications in the second quarter, up from 11,000 modifications in the first quarter. These modifications include principal forgiveness, term extensions and interest rate reductions.", "In most loans that we modified we eliminate the negative am feature, confirm income and reduce debt to income to no higher than 38%. We are seeing very positive early performance on these loan modifications but it is still too early to declare a success. However, we are confident that the significant loan modification efforts we are making will reduce the future losses we will realize in this portfolio. In addition, the lower carrying value that results from these modifications improves loan-to-values.", "For the first time in over five years, deferred interest balances declined this quarter due in part to lower interest rates and the impact of gradually increasing minimum payment requirements which not only eliminates additions to deferred interest but reduces the deferred interest already outstanding. Finally, after once again reviewing the impaired pick-a-pay portfolio, we did not need to take any credit reserve strengthening actions during the quarter on that portfolio.", "In addition to pick-a-pay we continued working with customers on other real estate secured loans throughout our portfolio to help ensure ongoing affordability. In the first half of 2009, through lower rates, refinances and modifications, we helped close to one million homeowners. This includes providing more than 200,000 trial and completed modifications including those made in our pick-a-pay portfolio, an increase of more than 100% from the same period last year. We\u2019re doing everything we can to help customers including increasing our trained staff by 54% over the first half of this year to 11,500 default team members.", "It is important when analyzing trends for the quarter to remember that these loan modifications also affected certain credit metrics. For example, if a modification includes some debt forgiveness, the amount forgiving will generally be charged off and increase net charge offs for the period. However, one effect of this forgiveness may be to pull forward net charge offs that might otherwise have occurred in the future. Therefore, a current period charge off is in effect a derisking action that may benefit future portfolio credit quality. Loan modifications can also create troubled debt restructurings. We do not reclassify to accruing status a non-accrual loan that has been modified until the borrower has made at least six consecutive payments under the modified terms.", "Our credit performance continued to benefit from our efforts to reduce our balance sheet exposure to higher risk loans. Approximately $114 billion of consumer loans are from businesses we have exited or from portfolios that we are running off. These include legacy Wells Fargo indirect auto, a portfolio we began reducing nearly two years ago, indirect home equity which we also exited almost two years ago, pick-a-pay which Wachovia stopped originating last year and which was subject to purchase account write downs and has benefited from our success in modifying the loans.", "Additionally, we are focused on further reducing certain higher risk portions of Wachovia\u2019s commercial real estate division\u2019s portfolio. In total, these portfolios have been reduced $51 billion or 24% since June 30, 2008 to write downs, run off or modification including a $6.3 billion reduction just in the second quarter of 2009. Because we have been reducing credit exposure for some of these higher risk portfolios, we believe growth in loan losses will be more moderate than what would otherwise be the case and the peak in our credit losses would be expected to occur earlier.", "The increase in non-accrual loans during the quarter was as expected. When analyzing our non-accruals it is important to keep in mind several things first, about 60% of the increase in non-accruing loans came from Wachovia\u2019s non-impaired loan portfolio largely due to Wachovia\u2019s impaired loans being written down through purchase accounting at the time of the merger and the removal of those loans from non-accrual status which left only $92 million in non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2008. Because of the low starting point, there was an expected repopulation of non-accrual loans balances that primarily occurred in the second quarter. Going forward, the increase in non-accrual loans attributable to this repopulation effect will be much less significant.", "Second, not all non-performing loans result in a loss. More than 90% of the second quarter\u2019s $18.3 billion in non-performing assets are secured. We consider both delinquency and default non-performing status and both loss and allowance estimates for our consumer loan portfolios. The consumer problem loan policy requires real estate secured loans to be p laced on non-accrual at 120 days past due. At 180 days past due the loan is written down to the net realizable value and the loss is taking through charge offs. The allowance therefore captures emerging loss estimates for these loans. The majority of the loss associated with these loans is taken at 180 days past due.", "Because of the continued weakness in the real estate market and large amount of loan modifications we\u2019ve completed, non-performing loans are staying on the books longer than in the past and additions to non-performers showed signs of stabilization due to the benefit of loss mitigation and prior credit typing. We continue to build our allowance for credit losses totaling $23.5 billion which included a $700 million credit reserve build in the second quarter. The allowance covers approximately 12 months of expected losses for our consumer portfolios and inherent losses in commercial and commercial real estate portfolios expected to emerge over approximately the next 24 months. The allowance coverage considers the current economic environment, the impact of our derisking and the historical performance of the loan portfolios.", "Let me now turn to capital; we continued to significantly build capital during the quarter with our tier I common equity to risk weighted assets reaching 4.49% at quarter end, up from 3.12% at March 31st. Tangible common equity to total risk weighted assets was 5.24% at quarter end, up from 3.84% at March 31st and tier I capital to total risk weighted assets reached 9.8%, up from 8.3% at March 31st.", "By June 30, 2009 we had already generated $14.2 billion toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s $13.7 billion SCAP capital requirement an excess of $500,000 million. We generated this $14.2 billion through an $8.6 billion equity raise and by generating capital internally in the second quarter including $2.4 billion of actual pre-provision net revenue or pretax pre-provision profit plus certain federal reserve adjustments in excess of the Federal Reserve\u2019s estimate, $2.7 billion realized of deferred tax assets and $500 million of other internally generated sources of capital including core deposit intangible amortization. These internal sources of SCAP qualifying capital are expected to further add to the $14.2 billion in the third quarter.", "As you know, we accepted the US Treasury\u2019s investment of $25 billion last October to help extend credit in to the US economy and we have extended a total of $471 billion to credit worthy customers since then, nearly 19 times the government\u2019s investment. We will work closely with our regulators to determine the appropriate time to repay their investment and we will do this in a shareholder friendly way while maintaining strong capital levels.", "In summary, it has truly been an exceptional quarter and year for our company. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the performance of our businesses across the board and underscoring the balanced strength of our diversified business model which drove a record $3.2 billion in profit. This demonstrated once again an ability to create sustainable growth through all cycles, very much what we\u2019ve been saying throughout the credit crisis.", "While of course we still operating in the challenging economic environment, it is worth repeating some of our accomplishments this quarter: record revenue up 28% annualized from first quarter; record pretax pre-provision profit of $9.8 billion with strong contributions across our diverse businesses; our best mortgage origination quarter since 2003; net interest margin of 4.3%, the highest among large bank peers; 20% growth annualized in average consumer checking account and savings deposits; higher capital ratios; and strengthened reserves. The new Wells Fargo is off to a very powerful start and we see an incredible future in the years ahead.", "If you have any questions, please call Bob Strickland, Director of Investor Relations at 415-396-0523 or Jim Rowe, Associate Director at 415-396-8216.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Atkins \u2013 Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President", "Bob Strickland", "Hello, this is Bob Strickland. Thank you for participating in the Wells Fargo third quarter", "2009 earnings review prerecorded call.", "Before we discuss our third quarter results, we need to make the standard securities law disclosure. In this call we will make forward-looking statements about specific income statement and balance sheet items and other measures of our future financial results and condition, including statements about future nonaccruals, loss content and cash flows from the legacy Wachovia impaired non-impaired loan portfolios, expected credit losses and credit performance generally and in specific loan portfolios, the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, future levels of nonperforming assets, future levels of capital, the timing and amount of expected merger one-time expenses, cost savings and business and revenue synergies related to the Wachovia merger and other initiatives, and our ability to generate revenue growth and earnings.", "These forward-looking statements are based on our expectations, and they are not guarantees of future performance. They speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date. Actual results may differ materially from expectations due to a number of factors, including our ability to successfully integrate Wachovia and realize the expected cost savings and benefits from the merger. There is no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will be adequate to cover future credit losses, especially if credit markets, housing prices and unemployment do not stabilize or improve. For a discussion of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations, refer to our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today, which includes the press release announcing our third quarter results, and our First and Second Quarter 10-Qs and our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, each available on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov.", "In this call we will also discuss our Tier 1 common equity and related capital ratios, as well as pre-tax, pre-provision profit. For more information about these measures refer to our third quarter earnings press release, which is accessible on our website, wellsfargo.com, by clicking on \u201cAbout Us,\u201d then \u201cInvestor Relations,\u201d then \u201cQuarterly Earnings.\u201d We have also posted on our website a third quarter 2009 supplement that provides additional information on our loan portfolios and businesses.", "I will now turn the call over to CFO, Howard Atkins.", "Howard Atkins", "Thanks, Bob. I have a lot of ground to cover in my comments so I want to give you up-front the three key author\u2019s messages about our third quarter.", "First, we continued to generate earnings and capital at a record rate in the third quarter despite cyclically elevated credit costs. The main reason is that our diversified business model continued to generate very strong revenue as it has in other environments. Quarterly revenue net of expenses was once again this quarter more than double our quarterly net charge offs, a positive margin of $5.7 billion. We have increased shareholders equity by $23 billion since the merger and have exceeded the SCAP requirement by a wide margin.", "Second, Wachovia is already additive to Wells Fargo\u2019s earnings and capital growth, earlier and better than originally anticipated. Revenue synergies have been significant. Expense savings from the consolidation are on track for $5 billion annually by the end of 2011 and we now expect substantially lower merger and integration costs. Credit costs in the aggregate are in line with our expectations at the time of the merger with cumulative Pick-a-Pay losses now expected to be less than originally projected.", "Third, we are seeing signs of stability in our credit portfolio and based on our current economic outlook, we expect credit losses to peak in 2010 with consumer losses potentially peaking in first half of the year and gradually declining as the year progresses. We have substantially less exposure to credit cards than our peers with large, national credit card portfolios. Where we do have large exposure, in commercial and commercial real estate, we are comfortable with how the legacy Wells Fargo portfolios were underwritten and are performing and we have previously written down the Wachovia portfolios at close of that acquisition late last year.", "Let me elaborate on these three points. Wells Fargo once again achieved record earnings in the third quarter despite elevated credit costs. Our $3.2 billion net income was our third record quarter in a row. We have earned more than $3 billion in each quarter in 2009. Year-to-date earnings in 2009 a record of $9.5 billion were up 75% from a year ago indicating our company\u2019s ability to absorb higher credit costs over the cycle.", "After deducting preferred and common dividends, cumulative retained earnings so far this year were $6.9 billion, the main reason we are generating capital internally at a very fast rate. In combination with other internally generated sources of capital and with two of the largest non-IPO offerings of common stock in history, we have more than doubled the company\u2019s equity since before the merger late last year.", "There are three main reasons our earnings have been so consistently strong. The first relates to our business model, the second relates to the benefits we are already seeing from the Wachovia consolidation and the third relates to how we manage credit. The key driver of our earnings is revenue. Our third quarter revenue was $22.5 billion, equal to the record revenue we generated in second quarter, and our pre-tax pre-provision profit, total revenue less noninterest expense, was $10.8 billion, a record for the company. Wells Fargo\u2019s revenue was about 92% of the average revenue of the other largest banks in the U.S. even though we are only about 60% of their size based on average assets.", "In fact our revenue per dollar of assets, 7.2% before expenses and 3.4% after expenses, is significantly and consistently greater than any of the other three largest U.S. banks. In the third quarter we produced pre-tax, pre-provision profit that once again was more than double our quarterly credit costs. At a time when many U.S. companies are struggling for sales, Wells Fargo had record sales in the third quarter. This is because we are gaining new customers, increasing the number of products sold to existing customers and increasing market share. Core product sales, for example, at legacy Wells Fargo regional bank were 6.84 million in the quarter, a record and up 10% from last year on a comparable basis.", "Retail bank cross-sell was 5.90 products per household, a record, and wholesale cross-sell was 6.4 products. The Wells Fargo revenue machine is a direct consequence of the breadth and depth of our diversified business model and our singular focus on earning all of our customers\u2019 financial business. That focus has generated strong and consistent revenue growth over the last 20 years. In any given period some of our businesses are affected differently by the economy or interest rates and some, like insurance, are seasonal, but in combination they tend to produce exceptional revenue.", "While mortgage originations and servicing revenue remained high in the third quarter, total mortgage banking noninterest income represented less than 15% of consolidated company third quarter revenue, reflecting the breadth and depth of the Company\u2019s business model. In the third quarter we had linked quarter double digit annualized revenue growth in asset management, auto lending, consumer finance, debit cards, retirement services, SBA lending and wealth management.", "Let me highlight some of the key business drivers of our revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter. We have had great success growing deposits and accounts throughout the credit crisis. Combined average checking and savings deposits increased 11% annualized from second quarter and are up 16% annualized since the first quarter, in part due to the conversion of higher rate CDs into lower rate liquid deposits. Checking and savings accounts now represent 83% of total core deposits. Deposit and account growth has been strong across our customer segments.", "Consumer checking accounts were up a net 5.2% overall and a net 6.4% at legacy Wells Fargo from prior year. We continued to experience strong consumer checking account growth in California, still our largest deposit state, with a net 9% increase in consumer checking accounts. Core deposits in our Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement business grew 10% annualized and wholesale core deposits grew 25% annualized. We continued to supply credit to U.S. consumers and businesses with over $547 billion of new credit extended to customers through the third quarter this year.", "Wells Fargo has extended more credit than any other bank in the U.S. this year through August 2009, including mortgage securities purchased. Because non-mortgage loan demand has been soft so far this year and since we originate conforming mortgages for sale, our significant credit extended has not translated into an increase in assets on the balance sheet but it has boosted loan-related fee income.", "Mortgage origination fees of $1.13 billion were up $849 million from a year ago and charges and fees on loans were $453 million, up 70% from last year and up 12% annualized from second quarter. In wholesale banking we continued to add new customers and do more business with existing customers. In a slower economic cycle, commercial loan demand is naturally weaker, but when the economy recovers and loan demand resumes, we will benefit from these additional customer relationships and the deeper relationships we have with our current customers.", "Trust and investment fees were up 15% annualized linked quarter, including strong growth in managed account fees, consistent with market trends, and modest growth in brokerage transaction revenue, overcoming typical seasonality. Client assets in our wealth, brokerage and retirement business continued their year-long growth reaching $1.2 trillion this quarter and up 8% from second quarter. Retirement plan assets increased 9% to $271 billion and IRA assets also rose 9% to $231 billion.", "Wells Fargo is now the third largest U.S. wealth manager based on client assets and the second largest based on number of financial advisors. The average productivity of our 21,500 registered financial reps has increased each quarter with new financial advisors more productive on average than displaced advisors. This large productive group of financial advisors across the U.S., branded as Wells Fargo Advisors is quickly becoming an important new distribution channel for banking products since the 21,500 advisors nationally have access to and are already selling Wells Fargo\u2019s suite of deposits, trust and other banking products.", "Card fees grew 10% annualized from second quarter. Unlike many of our peers, our credit card business remains profitable despite elevated credit losses, which actually were down slightly from second quarter. Consumer spending continued to be dampened by the economy with fewer big ticket purchases in the third quarter resulting in a decline in average transaction size on both debit and credit cards. At the same time, consumers are increasingly using their debit cards for everyday items such as gas and grocery purchases, which is helping to increase overall card volume.", "Linked quarter purchase volume on cards was up 22% with the majority of the growth from legacy Wells Fargo debit cards, increased volume from Wachovia debit and credit cards and Wells Fargo Financial. Global Remittance Service is another consumer payments business that continued to generate strong household and volume growth. Transaction volumes were up 22% year-to-date while dollar volume growth increased 5% over the same period. With the Wachovia merger, our presence in the primary U.S. geographies that send remittance payments to Latin America has increased from 54% to 88%. This business is also benefitting from a new online option that supplements the current store and phone bank distribution channels.", "The auto business continued to benefit from industry trends, gaining market share in both the new and used car space while simultaneously improving credit quality. Revenues grew 12% annualized from the second quarter. The popular Cash for Clunkers program generated record monthly auto originations of $1.5 billion for August. The loans originated under this program have been high quality with higher levels of cash down and better customer credit scores than existing auto loans in our portfolio. While auto losses typically rise during the second half of the year, losses in our core indirect auto portfolio were actually down slightly from second quarter reflecting the benefit of higher used car prices, with the Manheim Used Car Index at record levels.", "We also benefitted from an improved customer mix within our portfolio and the tighter underwriting standards we put in place at the start of this credit cycle. Student lending provided increased lending opportunities and growth in our customer base. We have successfully transitioned our student loan business to leverage opportunities in private student lending across the expanded Wells Fargo footprint. Private loan originations are up 10% year-to-date compared with 2008, driven by seasonally strong third quarter back to school volume.", "Originations of government student loans increased 14% over the same time period. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage once again generated strong results in the third quarter benefiting from their business model\u2019s balance between originations and servicing. Origination revenue was down in the third quarter as volumes declined from very high first and second quarter levels, while servicing revenue was up. Total revenue for this business was down modestly in the third quarter from second quarter. Total originations of $96 billion in the third quarter were strong, although down from second quarter.", "Lower mortgage rates early in the fourth quarter are currently driving strong application volume, which was up 36% in the first 10 business days of the fourth quarter compared to the same period in the third quarter although the pace of applications will obviously depend on mortgage rates since about 70% of this activity was refinance related. With a 33 basis point decline in mortgage rates during the third quarter, we wrote down the value of the MSRs by $2.1 billion, which was more than offset by economic hedge gains of $3.6 billion.", "The economic hedges once again generated solid carry income reflecting the low rates in the third quarter which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter. Future hedge results, of course, will also depend on the amount of servicing that is hedged and the composition of the hedging instruments. The ratio of MSRs to loans serviced for others was 83 basis points at quarter-end, down from 134 basis points a year ago and the third lowest ratio in our company\u2019s history. The average servicing portfolio note rate was only 5.72%. The second key message is that we are seeing a contribution to earnings and capital growth from Wachovia that is occurring earlier and better than originally anticipated.", "We are on track to achieve the originally targeted $5.0 billion of annual run rate savings upon full integration which we still expect by the end of 2011. After having begun to consolidate the two banks in the three quarters since we have owned Wachovia, we are now beginning to realize about 1/3 of these savings on a run rate basis. We have very detailed plans to achieve the balance of the savings over the next two years as the systems integration and store conversions are completed in 2011. We now estimate we will spend approximately $5.5 billion in merger costs compared with our previous $7.9 billion estimate.", "The projection has been lowered primarily because we are achieving greater proportion of the labor cost savings through attrition rather than severance and because the cost of disposing and/or subleasing owned office space has turned out to be lower than assumed. Of this $5.5 billion, we have spent $1 billion; $559 million through goodwill under purchase accounting and $444 million expensed to earnings including $200 million in the third quarter. A portion of the remaining merger costs will be taken through purchase accounting adjustments to goodwill in the fourth quarter with the balance of the merger costs to be taken as expenses over the next two years.", "We will report on these expenses each quarter and we believe these expenses will likely be offset by merger related savings over the next two years leaving us with the full benefit of the $5 billion annual savings once the integration is completed. Our first banking state conversion, in Colorado, is coming up next month. After Colorado we will continue to convert our other overlap markets followed by the non-overlap markets. Once the conversions are complete, we will offer unmatched convenience for our 70 million customers, with similar products on a common system nationwide.", "While the banking store branding and system conversions remain ahead of us over the next couple of years, much has already been accomplished in terms of preparing for the conversions and rebranding other major businesses such as Wells Fargo Advisors, Wells Fargo Securities, Wells Fargo Mortgage and Wells Fargo Insurance, as well as beginning to instill legacy Wells Fargo\u2019s sales practices into the new part of our banking franchise. As a result, the cross sell ratio at legacy Wachovia increased to 4.65 in the third quarter, up from 4.55 in the second quarter.", "When we priced the Wachovia merger we assumed no revenue synergies but of course revenue synergies are occurring daily. Let me give you four examples of the many areas where synergies are already occurring. In the securities business we are actively marketing Wachovia\u2019s securities placement capabilities to the combined companies\u2019 expanded base of corporate and commercial relationships to win more and more lead and co-lead bond and equity mandates and fees. Wells Fargo always had commercial and corporate customers who needed access to the capital markets.", "With the Wachovia merger we now have an outstanding investment banking business to meet our customers\u2019 debt, equity and advisory needs. Parenthetically, this is another great example of how having a diversified model provides revenue in all environments. One reason commercial loan demand has been soft this year is because commercial borrowers are accessing the public markets for financing instead of drawing on their bank lines. Having the securities placement business helps us remain in the flow of our customers\u2019 financings, whether they borrow from the bank or borrow directly from the capital markets.", "The 21,500 financial advisors I mentioned earlier opens up an entirely new and significant source for offering Wells Fargo products and services and we are actively making it very efficient for those advisors to be able to access all of our banking product platforms. These financial advisors already contribute to our mortgage originations and deposit growth. To give you some idea of the potential, the 21,500 base of financial advisors compares to over 28,000 platform banker FTE\u2019s throughout our regional banking network.", "A third example of revenue synergies with Wachovia would be government and industrial banking, which helps meet the financial needs of government, education, healthcare and tax-exempt organizations by offering credit, treasury services and investment banking solutions. Legacy Wells Fargo had many customer relationships with local and state governments within our community banking footprint and we had recently began to develop a team to better meet their needs. With the Wachovia merger we now have an integrated model providing seamless coordination and delivery of services to this customer base.", "Throughout the economic downturn, we have continuously provided credit for government and institutional clients nationwide and have increased loan commitments by 14% since the beginning of the year and the final example of revenue synergies with Wachovia would be Global Financial Institutions and Trade Services, which provides global correspondent banking services, such as payments and trade solutions, trade and working capital financing and deposit products to 1,450 international banks, 2,200 domestic banks and 30 multilateral institutions from 42 locations around the world.", "This business is benefiting from the improvement in global economic activity, which drove payment and trade fees up 8% annualized from second quarter and core deposit growth up 13% from second quarter. The combination with a smaller but complementary Wells Fargo team brings new foreign exchange and deposit capabilities to bank clients but more significantly the combined global financial institutions business offers a highly developed network of strong and experienced partner banks enabling every Wells Fargo customer to connect to the world. We are on track, if not ahead, in terms of reducing Wachovia\u2019s credit risk.", "We have dealt with this in several ways. At merger closing we built significant reserves for credit losses including conforming credit loss emergence practices to the more conservative practices of Wachovia and Wells Fargo. Second, through purchase accounting we wrote down the higher risk segments of Wachovia\u2019s loan portfolios including the portion of their commercial real estate portfolio with the highest probability of default. Unlike other banks that have yet to incur losses on the highest risk portions of their loans, we have already accounted for these losses.", "Overall we believe our life of loan loss estimate originally assumed still holds, with commercial a little higher and Pick-a-Pay lower. In the third quarter we added $184 million to reserves for impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans.", "Based on our most recent estimates, life of loan losses for Pick-a-Pay are expected to be below original expectations and accordingly we now expect to add modestly to accretable yield for Pick-a- Pay going forward. Third, Wachovia securities portfolio and trading assets were already at fair value at merger closing, but we wrote off the unrealized losses in OCI as a reduction in the carrying value of these assets. If anything, the unrealized value of these assets has improved significantly since the acquisition closed due to the subsequent decline in long-term yields and recovery of credit spreads.", "Fourth, we have also eliminated risk by reducing balances, the identified high risk portfolios of commercial real estate, indirect auto and Pick-a-Pay have been reduced by $5.7 billion linked quarter through write-downs, modifications and sales.", "Let me now turn to credit. We provide a lot of detail on our individual loan portfolios in our quarterly supplement which is available in the investor relations section of our website which you should refer to for our detailed analysis of credit performance this quarter. I want to spend my time on the call highlighting a few key credit trends and portfolios. While credit losses and NPAs increased again this quarter, the rate of increase slowed and we have seen signs of stabilization in several consumer loan portfolios.", "Consumer loans 90 days past due actually declined $140 million from second quarter and total loans 90 days past due, excluding insured GNMA loans, was up only $8 million, essentially flat. The loss rate in the third quarter for legacy Wells Fargo was 3.37%, below large bank peers. Our overall loss rate of 2.5% reflects the benefit of purchase accounting on Wachovia\u2019s higher-risk loan portfolios at year end. Legacy Wells Fargo net charge-offs were relatively flat from the second quarter reflecting lower losses in commercial and commercial real estate and slightly higher losses in consumer.", "Wachovia\u2019s net charge-offs increased to 1.66% of average loans due to some deterioration in its portfolios and the lagging impact of purchase accounting. The increase in commercial and commercial real estate losses in Wachovia\u2019s non-impaired portfolio reflects the lagging impact of purchase accounting with the overall loss rate in the third quarter for Wachovia\u2019s portfolio roughly comparable to Wells Fargo\u2019s high quality portfolio. Over 40% of the increase in Wachovia\u2019s consumer losses came from the non-impaired Pick-a-Pay portfolio, reflecting the lagging effect of purchase accounting.", "We expect credit losses to peak in the first half of next year in our consumer portfolio and later in 2010 in our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios absent further deterioration of the economy. Nonaccrual loans were up again this quarter, although at a slightly lower growth rate. Purchase accounting for Wachovia\u2019s loans has resulted in some anomalies in our nonaccrual growth rate.", "Here\u2019s one way to think about this. At year end 2008, Wachovia had $20 billion of nonaccruals that were eliminated at closing due to purchase accounting for credit impaired loans. Since then, about $14 billion of the estimated life of loan losses we reserved for under purchase accounting have actually been charged to the non-accretable difference rather than charged off against loans.", "If we were to add back the $20 billion in Wachovia\u2019s nonaccruals to the reported nonaccrual total, nonaccruals would have grown from $27 billion at December 31, 2008 (including legacy Wells Fargo nonaccruals) to $41 billion at September 30, 2009. That\u2019s before reducing the September 30, 2009 nonaccruals for a substantial portion of the $14 billion in charge-offs that would have reduced the ending nonaccrual balance. So in effect we believe purchase accounting had a significant impact on the nonaccrual growth rate this year and the impact of the credit deterioration in nonaccruals has actually been less significant than what is implied by our reported growth rate.", "The $2.7 billion increase in commercial and commercial real estate nonaccrual loans in the third quarter was down from the $3.1 billion increase in the second quarter. Nonaccrual commercial loans in Wells Fargo\u2019s portfolio were up only $777 million. Wachovia\u2019s growth rate slowed and the $1.9 billion increase in commercial and commercial real estate from second quarter reflects some deterioration in the portfolio, but is in line with expectations post purchase accounting and is reflected in our allowance for credit losses. 50% of the total increase in commercial nonaccruals was from five large relationships and 70% of the increase was driven by four industries (real estate-related services, nonbank financials, media and gaming).", "The rate of growth in consumer nonaccruals also slowed with the increase in legacy Wells Fargo\u2019s consumer portfolio only $606 million from the second quarter and the increase in Wachovia\u2019s consumer portfolio was primarily driven by the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. The growth in Pick-a-Pay nonaccruals reflected the inflows expected after purchase accounting write-downs. We continued to be active in modifying Pick-a-Pay loans through the use of troubled debt restructurings, which are expected to temporarily keep nonaccrual levels elevated until the modified loans can demonstrate performance.", "Let me highlight three of our loan portfolios. Our $23.6 billion credit card portfolio is only 3% of total loans, significantly less than other large bank peers. Our credit cards are sold primarily to our retail banking customers. We have not focused on being a large national credit card company. The smaller relative size and relationship focus of our portfolio is one reason we now believe our total consumer losses will peak in first half 2010. In fact, the loss rate on our credit card portfolio, while still elevated from historical norms, was actually down slightly from second quarter.", "Our $135 billion commercial real estate portfolio, down $2.6 billion from year-end, is larger than our peers, but is well diversified by property type and geography. As expected, losses throughout our CRE portfolio have increased from historically low levels. However, we also believe that our relationship focus and prudent credit discipline build inherently higher quality into the CRE loan book compared with the rest of the industry. Our commercial real estate portfolio is primarily originated through two key channels. $79 billion are in the Wholesale Banking Group, which originates both larger and more complex CRE loans in our Real Estate Banking Group as well as loans to medium-size customers in our Middle Market Real Estate Group and our Commercial Banking Group.", "Within Wholesale Banking, the CRE portfolio, which includes C&I loans managed by the Commercial Real Estate Group, can be broken into three portfolios, the portfolio originated at legacy Wells Fargo and two portfolios originated at Wachovia, one credit impaired and one non-impaired. The $34 billion CRE portfolio that was originated at legacy Wells Fargo is led by a seasoned and experienced management team that has worked together for decades including through the troubled commercial real estate market in the early 90s. Underwriting in this portfolio is focused primarily on cash flows and creditworthiness of the borrower, not solely on valuations. Losses in this portfolio actually decreased from second quarter to 1.30%, down from 2.80%.", "The majority of Wachovia\u2019s CRE portfolio is managed by a dedicated specialty group focused on mitigating risk and losses utilizing a variety of asset restructuring, disposition and workout strategies and includes the $31 billion of Wachovia originated commercial real estate loans that were not credit impaired. The loss rate on this portfolio is increasing as expected from the extremely low level earlier in the year post purchase accounting.", "The third quarter loss rate on this portfolio was in line with the loans originated at Wells Fargo with a third quarter loss rate of 1.28%. The $12 billion of loans originated at Wachovia that were included in the credit impaired portfolio are also being managed by the dedicated specialty group. While the loss rates on the impaired portfolio have been significantly higher than our core wholesale CRE portfolio, they are generally performing as we had anticipated. Charge-offs in this portfolio were $143 million in the third quarter. Since this is an impaired portfolio, resolutions to assets which would normally be reflected as loan loss recoveries are accounted for as either net interest income or non-interest income.", "These recoveries totaled $64 million in the third quarter. Therefore the economic net loss on this portfolio was only $80 million, or 2.63%. The $39 billion of CRE loans originated through the Regional Business Banking Group have a smaller average loan size of approximately $600,000 and are geographically diverse. Approximately half of these loans are owner-occupied. The loss rate on this portfolio in the third quarter was 1.28%.", "The other portfolio I would like to highlight is the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. We are very encouraged with the performance to date of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio and actually expect lower life of loan losses than we would estimated at the time of merger for both the credit impaired and non-impaired portfolios.", "Due to our improved current outlook, beginning in the fourth quarter we expect to recognize a modest yield increase in our impaired portfolio, recapturing a portion of the life of loan purchase accounting marks through net interest income. While the housing market, unemployment and the economy levels will affect future performance, let me explain why we are optimistic about the future performance of this portfolio.", "First, we have been actively modifying these loans and have completed nearly 20,000 full-term modifications in the third quarter and over 43,500 modifications year to date, modifying 22% of the loans in the impaired portfolio. Nearly 98% of the modifications completed have decreased the payment materially for the customer, which we believe is the key driver of success. All modifications are re-underwritten, income is verified and the negative amortization feature is eliminated.", "For the modifications we completed earlier this year, our re-default rates after six months have been less than half the 41% re-default rates for industry modifications with a comparable amount of seasoning. But, we acknowledge it is still very early in the lives of these modifications and we will continue to report on performance going forward.", "Second, we have continued to reduce the size of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio to a total of $87.8 billion outstanding, down $2.6 billion from second quarter and down $7.5 billion from year-end. This decline reflects loans paid in full, loss mitigation efforts and the fact we are not originating any new loans in this portfolio.", "Third, while this portfolio is called the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, only 74% of it is Pick-a-Pay loans which have negative amortization potential, down from 86% at year-end, a $22 billion reduction. So, not all loans that we include in our Pick-a-Pay portfolio are pay option loans with negative amortization potential.", "Fourth, deferred interest balances declined for the second consecutive quarter due to the combination of lower interest rates and the impact of gradually increasing minimum payment requirements, as well as our modification programs. In September, approximately one-third of the customers who chose to make the minimum payment did not defer interest. While customers\u2019 minimum payments have continued to increase annually, market interest rates have decreased and many customers are at the point where their minimum payment not only covered the interest due, but paid down some principal as well. We expect this trend to continue.", "Fifth, the stabilization in the outlook on home prices in certain markets where we have significant exposure benefits the expected performance of the portfolio. Finally, we have observed improvements in delinquency roll rates compared to projections earlier in the year. As you would expect, our non-impaired and impaired Pick-a-Pay portfolios are very different. The non-impaired portfolio has shown stronger credit characteristics. Let me explain the key differences.", "The average loan size on the non-impaired portfolio is $227,000, versus $326,000 in the impaired portfolio. A significant portion of the non-impaired portfolio was originated prior to 2006 with an average age of loans of 5.5 years, versus 3.5 years in the impaired portfolio. 49% of the non-impaired portfolio is in California, compared with 68% of the impaired portfolio. The non-impaired portfolio includes a large subset of loans that would be expected to have minimal losses even if they were to go into default with 36% of the portfolio having an updated CLTV of less than 80%.", "Our Pick-a-Pay portfolio continued to perform better than the industry. Recent data released by the OCC indicates that as of June 30, 2009, 25% of all industry option ARM loans are at least 60 days past due while only 17% of our portfolio was 60 days or more past due, with most of these loans in the impaired portfolio. These delinquency rates demonstrate, what we have always believed, that our option ARM portfolio is of better quality than the rest of the industry.", "Finally, I want to update you on our most recent analysis of the impact of the application of FAS 166 and 167 which is expected to result in the consolidation of certain off-balance sheet assets currently not included in our financial statements. We provided a preliminary analysis in our second quarter 10-Q. Based on our continued refinement of this analysis we now expect approximately $55 billion in incremental GAAP assets to be brought on balance sheet representing approximately $28 billion in incremental risk-weighted assets. This latest analysis is lower than we originally projected primarily due to a reduction in the amount of securitized residential mortgages that will be consolidated.", "In addition, we continue to explore the sale of certain interests we hold in securitized residential mortgage loans which would further reduce the amount of incremental GAAP assets and incremental risk-weighted assets. In summary, while the economic recovery continues at its own pace, we are forging ahead and playing to our strengths. One year after the merger agreement with Wachovia was announced, we generated record earnings and capital as we benefit from a diversity of businesses, many of which produce countercyclical performance, and help create sustainable growth in all cycles.", "We are seeing a good contribution to revenue from Wachovia as we make progress in laying the groundwork for a nationwide platform to provide the utmost in service and convenience for our 70 million customers. We are seeing signs of stability in the credit portfolio and currently expect credit losses to peak in 2010 with consumer losses potentially peaking in the first half of the year and gradually declining as the year progresses absent further economic deterioration. We are exhibiting strong expense discipline, and bearing the fruit of prior expense initiatives as well as merger efficiencies. We have generated, once again, an industry-leading net interest margin, at 4.36% and we have continued to strengthen the balance sheet, build credit reserves and reduce risk on our balance sheet.", "This is our last recorded call. Wells Fargo has always been committed to providing clear, complete, and transparent communication about the company\u2019s results to all of its stakeholders. As we enter the second year of the merger with Wachovia, we will be expanding our quarterly communications to include a live quarterly earnings conference call starting in January for our Q4 and full year 2009 results and we will also host an Investor Day in 2010.", "If you have any questions, please call Bob Strickland, Director of Investor Relations, at 415- 396-0523, or Jim Rowe, Associate Director, at 415-396-8216.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Celeste and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo fourth quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn today\u2019s call over to Mr. Bob Strickland. Please go ahead, sir.", "Bob Strickland", "Good morning. This is Bob Strickland, Director of Investor Relations at Wells Fargo. Thank you for joining us on our call today where John Stumpf and Howard Atkins will review fourth quarter and full year 2009 results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and financial supplements are available on our website. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call and that those forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.", "Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today and the earnings release and financial supplement included as exhibits. In addition, some of the discussion today about the company\u2019s performance will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can be found in our SEC filings and in the earnings release and financial supplement available on our website at wellsfargo.com.", "I will now turn the call over to the Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thanks, Bob, and thanks to everyone who has joined us this morning on this call. We appreciate your interest in Wells Fargo and look forward to reviewing our results and answering your questions. First, let me say how proud I am of all the dedicated Wells Fargo team members across the nation who put forth tremendous effort to help us achieve strong results throughout the year.", "In my 28 years at Wells Fargo, I believe 2009 was the best year we ever had in terms of positioning us for the future growth. Looking back at where we were last year at this time, I believe our business is better in virtually every aspect. We generated record earnings, strengthened our balance sheet, and removed a great deal of risk from our businesses. We generated significant capital, both internally and externally, ending the year with capital ratios higher than they were before we completed the Wachovia merger.", "I couldn\u2019t feel better about the opportunities ahead. With a company that is twice the size it was in 2008, we see tremendous opportunity ahead as we continue to integrate our two companies. The merger with Wachovia is exceeding all of our expectations in terms of expense savings, successfully meeting integration milestones, the quality of our team members and customers, and the opportunities we see together going forward.", "Now to be sure, we\u2019ve had \u2013 we\u2019ve all had to manage through a lot of change and uncertainty over the past year. While the economy is starting to show some signs, positive signs, and pockets of stability, the unemployment rate is still too high and housing price improvement continues to be spotty. No doubt, there will be surprises ahead. But the business model that has served Wells Fargo well for over two decades, focus on diversification and satisfying all of our customers\u2019 financial needs continues to serve us well in the current environment and will guide us through 2010 and beyond.", "In fact, if you liked Wells Fargo in the past, you should love us today. As a result of the merger with Wachovia, our business model is even stronger. We have more geographic diversity and twice the number of customers who we can better serve with a more diverse and powerful set of products. We are more balanced between fee income and interest income and between commercial and consumer businesses.", "And while we have gained much with our merger with Wachovia, much has remained the same. We have the same strong management team, I believe the best in the business, made even better with the addition of Wachovia team members who remain focused on providing exceptional customer service. We have the same culture and singular focus on helping our customers succeed financially, because when our customers succeed, so do we.", "We measure hundreds of things everyday at Wells Fargo. For example, how many checking accounts were opened, how many mortgages we originate, how many did we modify, how many assets do we have under management. But the most important thing we measure is revenue growth. We believe revenue growth is the best measure of how well we serve our customers.", "In 2009, we generated a record $89 billion in revenue, including fourth quarter revenue of $23 billion. This revenue growth was diverse with double-digit annualized linked-quarter growth in asset management, auto lending through Wachovia Dealer Services, merchant card, insurance, mortgage banking, and wealth management. With the merger, we see even more opportunities to grow.", "In addition, because of the financial crisis, we have never seen a better opportunity to grow market share and earn more of our existing customers\u2019 business. Let me give you some examples of what we already have achieved. On average, retail bank household at legacy Wells Fargo now has 5.95 cross-sell of Wells Fargo products, up from 5.73 products just a year ago. Our market share in mortgage originations is 23%, up from 16% in 2008 and 10% in 2006. In auto lending, we are the number one used auto lender with a 6% market share, up from 4% a year ago.", "In 2009, we ranked number one in middle-market lending market share, establishing more new relationships during the year than any other financial institution. While these market share gains demonstrate how we have benefited from our strength in the marketplace, our goal has never been to get bigger for the sake of being number one. We always start at what is best for our customer and our shareholders.", "The share that matters the most to us is the share of our customer\u2019s business. When a customer brings us more business, we can give them a better deal, they stay with us longer, they give us more opportunities to sell them more products and services, we know more about them and their financial needs, and we earn more profit per customer.", "As I look at the year ahead, there are many exciting things happening at Wells Fargo that we believe will benefit us for years to come. But as we\u2019ve always said, our top priority will be meeting the financial needs of our consumer and business customers, helping them and Wells Fargo succeed financially.", "Now let me turn this over to our CFO, Howard Atkins, for more details on our fourth quarter results and I\u2019ll be back with him at the end to take your questions. Howard?", "Howard Atkins", "Thanks, John. I\u2019d like to cover four topics in the next 20 minutes or so and then John and I would be happy to open up the call for your questions. Four things I\u2019d like to talk about; first, a quick recap of our fourth quarter results; secondly, I\u2019ll give you our take on credit quality; third, I\u2019d like to give you an update on Wachovia and how credit expenses, revenue synergies have performed compared to our acquisition model and integration objectives; and I\u2019ll conclude with a few remarks about the strength of our balance sheet and our capital.", "So let me talk about the fourth quarter. Our results in the fourth quarter were a great ending to what we think was a pretty remarkable year. The $2.8 billion we earned in the fourth quarter capped a record annual profit of $12.3 billion. And the key to these results, as John says and as it has always been at Wells Fargo, is revenue, which reached a record $22.7 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% annualized linked-quarter.", "Revenue growth at the company was solid across many of our diverse business lines, including wealth management, which had 21% revenue growth annualized linked-quarter; our investment banking business, up 25%; our insurance business, up 23%; and our auto business, up 14%. And you can see just how diverse that list of businesses is that had some strong revenue growth.", "Our mortgage business once again contributed to revenue growth with $94 billion in originations, very similar to the strong third quarter volume, and solid results in our mortgage servicing business. Hedging results in the mortgage business were strong again this quarter, and in fact could remain relatively high as long as short-term rates remain low and the hedge performs effectively.", "Our actual hedge results in any quarter, of course, will reflect how much of the servicing asset we hedge and the effectiveness of the particular instruments we used to hedge. Now we manage the mortgage business very holistically to achieve a target range of combined origination and servicing earnings within a reasonable range of interest rates. Our goal isn\u2019t to try to maximize profits each quarter, nor do we try to eliminate all interest rate risk.", "The mortgage business itself naturally provides some countercyclical balance to our overall results, but that\u2019s part of the value of our business model. At points in the business cyclical, less conducive to strong mortgage earnings, such as when the economy is strong or interest rates are higher, many of our other businesses contribute relatively more to our results in the mortgage business.", "To give you an example, in the current rate environment, we\u2019ve kept our powder dry at our mortgage-backed securities portfolio despite the significant growth we\u2019ve had in long duration core deposits all year on the possibility that today\u2019s relatively low mortgage rates return to historically more normal levels. So if anything, we are giving up current carry income in our investment portfolio right now.", "Loan demand remains soft in the fourth quarter although we did see some demand emerge in the consumer loan portfolio. Total loan outstandings were down $17 billion, less than the $22 billion decline we had in the third quarter. The fourth quarter decline was due to $4.7 billion reduction in what we call non-strategic consumer loans, $2.4 billion reduction in non-strategic commercial real estate loans, and $5.4 billion of net charge-offs. What I\u2019ll call the core or continuing consumer loan portfolio was actually flat in the fourth quarter, after declining every other quarter in 2009.", "On the commercial side, many of our commercial customers remained very liquid and line utilization on our $258 billion of revolving commercial commitments dropped again to about 35% compared to typical utilization rates in the 40s. Once the loan demand ticks up, we would expect to gain commercial lending market share because we already have the existing and extensive longstanding relationships with these customers.", "Our commercial customers\u2019 liquidity also reflects typically their strong financial position, one of the reasons why we\u2019ve experienced such low loss rates in our C&I portfolio. Expenses in the fourth quarter were up $1.1 billion from the third quarter, including $860 million of merger related and other incremental costs, including the previously disclosed $261 million expense provision for the auction rate security settlement.", "Apart from the auction rate securities settlement, the increase in expenses in Q4 breaks down into four sources. First, an expected increase in integration expenses before the end of 2009. Second, an increase in foreclosed asset expenses, which are likely to remain somewhat elevated for a while although not necessarily at fourth quarter levels. Third, a typical seasonal increase in expenses before year-end. And fourth, real reinvestment back into the business. We remain committed to tight expense discipline around everything we do while continuing to invest for the benefit of our customers for long-term revenue growth.", "Now let me turn to credit quality. Last quarter, if you remember, we said we expected consumer credit losses to peak in the first half of 2010 and commercial losses to peak in the second half of 2010, assuming no further economic deterioration. Based on the portfolio performance data we saw in the fourth quarter and assuming the same economic outlook, we are actually tracking somewhat better than those projections. The signs of a positive turn in credit are most evident in the consumer portfolio and the C&I portfolios.", "Let me hit consumer first. On the consumer side, 30-day delinquency balances were down, were stabilized in the fourth quarter in a number of portfolios, including personal credit management, credit card, auto, liquidating home equity portfolio, and small business direct. In addition, the more recent vintages have shown greatly improved credit performance across most of our consumer portfolios and loan rates for the Pick-A-Pay portfolio improved in the quarter, as they have for several quarters now, as you can see in more detail on page 33 in our quarterly supplement.", "Consumer non-accrual loan growth slowed in the quarter. All of the consumer non-accrual growth was in consumer real estate. The main reason for the growth in consumer real estate non-accruals was the volume of modifications we\u2019ve done for homeowners and the foreclosure moratorium, both of which actually pushed out the time when loans can return to performing status while we dropped off non-accrual through the foreclosure and disposition process.", "Credit losses in almost all of the consumer portfolios declined or stabilized in the fourth quarter. Losses declined from the third quarter in the liquidating home equity portfolio, credit card, personal credit management, Wells Fargo Financial auto, and Wells Fargo Financial credit card portfolios.", "We believe that if these trends continue, losses in about half of our 13 consumer lending businesses would have already peaked and it is possible \u2013 emphasis on the word possible \u2013 that consumer losses in total may also have already peaked. But of course, another downturn in the economy and particularly any further increase in unemployment could stall a decline in losses or even reverse that trend.", "The commercial loan portfolio, we also saw some signs that credit quality may be improving. After growing $2.7 billion in the third quarter, commercial and commercial real estate non-accruals were up only half as much in the fourth quarter, and all of that for the most part is in commercial real estate, with C&I non-accruals actually dropping in the fourth quarter. So of course, all consumer and commercial loan types, virtually all of the non-accrual increase in the fourth quarter for the company was in real estate secured portfolios.", "C&I and CRE loss rates remained relatively low compared to the industry, reflecting our historically strong underwriting and the fact that we already took $7 billion of write-downs against Wachovia\u2019s commercial real estate loans through purchase accounting when we close (inaudible). We remain comfortable with the mark we took on Wachovia\u2019s impaired CRE portfolio.", "Losses in the C&I and lease financing portfolios representing about 60% of total commercial losses were down on a combined basis in the fourth quarter. Finally, due to improved levels of liquidity, we saw increased opportunities in the market to liquidate commercial and commercial real estate assets.", "Let me very briefly highlight our Pick-A-Pay portfolio and CRE portfolio, both of which are outlined in more detail in our credit supplement, and explain a little bit why we believe these particular portfolios should perform better than the industry. The $85 billion Pick-A-Pay portfolio continued to perform better than originally expected at the time of the merger, driven by 52,000 modifications we completed during 2009, reducing the average monthly payment by 25% with interest rate reductions were more than 200 basis points on average and principal forgiveness was about $2.6 billion.", "The re-default rate on our modified loans has been roughly half of the re-default rates for the industry option ARM modifications, as reported by the OCC. For all mods that were completed in 2009 that are at least six months old, the 60-day re-default rate is about 14%. The improved outlook for this portfolio has also been driven by stabilization in certain markets where we have significant exposures such as California.", "The percentage of first time delinquent loans has dropped for six consecutive months and the percent of first time delinquent loans in our impaired portfolio during the fourth quarter was the lowest since the first quarter of 2008. The increase in non-accruals in this portfolio was primarily due to foreclosure moratoriums and HAMP processing and the growth was accounted for fully in our loss projections.", "Losses in our commercial real estate portfolio increased $266 million from the third quarter and included $165 million in charge-offs from the purchased credit-impaired loans where the losses exceeded the specific nonaccretable difference established for the particular loans. We also released $93 million nonaccretable difference was associated with PCI loans that were paid in full or sold. Now, these releases did not reduce charge-offs, but were recorded in net interest income or non-interest income.", "During the past year, we have re-underwritten and put resolution plans in place for the majority of the non-strategic CRE portfolio and reduced outstandings by $2.9 billion. While a significant portion of this portfolio is challenging, we remain comfortable with the impairment we took at the time of the merger. We expect to take write-downs and have positive resolutions in this portfolio from time to time.", "Now, let me shift to Wachovia. Having just completed the first year of the merger integration, I\u2019d like to summarize the impact of the merger from a financing perspective on our financial results, and let me start with credit. When we closed the merger with Wachovia, we identified roughly $94 billion of purchased credit-impaired loans and wrote them down by $37.2 billion through purchase accounting. That represented our best estimate of the losses in these portfolios over their remaining estimated lives and refer to that of course as a nonaccretable difference.", "During 2009, we refined our preliminary 12/31/08 purchase accounting write-downs to $41 billion, and now there will be no further refinements after 2009. The 2009 true-up was largely due to increase in the pool of loans we subjected to impairment as of 12/31/2008, not to any credit deterioration in this portfolio.", "Throughout 2009, we charged off PCI loans to this nonaccretable difference and released nonaccretable difference related to loans paid in full, sold, or reclassified to accretable yield for loans with improving cash flows. And at year-end 2009, the remaining nonaccretable difference was $22.9 billion.", "So net-net, we\u2019ve charged off $17.7 billion of the original $41 million. Going forward, we will continue to record charge-offs of PCI loans against this $22.9 billion nonaccretable difference, which we remain comfortable that it reflects the remaining life-of-loan losses for the PCI loans.", "Now, any subsequent deterioration after 12/31/08 in the PCI portfolio was taken into account in our credit reserve bills during 2009. While there was some pooling capability in the consumer portfolios for changes in life-of-loan estimates against individual consumer loans, most purchased credit-impaired commercial loans need to be accounted for on an individual basis.", "As a result, $333 million of the 2009 reserve build was for additional PCI life-of-loan estimates, including $100 million in the fourth quarter. When we wrote down the $94 billion of impaired loans by $41 billion, we effectively marked those assets to a market yield based on the expected cash flows in the PCI portfolio. The resulting PCI portfolio therefore is actually generating income at this yield and will continue to generate income every year until the PCI portfolio of assets are disposed off.", "In 2009, we recorded $2.6 billion of yield income on this portfolio, including $610 million in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s a yield if you do the math of roughly a 5% on the entire portfolio. At year-end 2009, the accretable balance was $14.6 billion, reflecting income we will record over the remaining life of these PCI loans.", "Now, as the portfolio ages, two factors can add to the yield and therefore to accrued income over time. First, our estimates of the life-of-loan losses may go down in some portfolios. In this case, we would record the improvement in income but only over the remaining life of the loans. Until we have a very high degree of confidence that the revised improvement is highly probable, we need to be judicious in terms of recording any improvement into income. And as I said, in any event, if we do, it\u2019s recorded over the life of the loan.", "Of the increase in accretable yield from the $10.4 billion at the beginning of 2009 to $14.6 billion at year-end 2009, we recorded only $441 million related to improved life-of-loan loss estimates on the PCI portfolio. And again, that $441 million will be recorded over time in net income. As we gain confidence in any improved estimates from this point forward, this could represent a material source of income over time in the future, particularly in portfolios like the PCI Pick-A-Pay portfolio where we are beginning to see improvement, but so far the amount added to income from this particular factor has been negligible.", "The second and so far larger factor relates to improvements in cash flow projections, primarily relating to loan modifications. As we modify loans that have already been written down through purchase accounting, we improve future cash flows on the modified loans even after taking into account potential re-defaults. The bulk of the increase in the accretable yield from $10.4 billion to $14.6 billion at the end of 2009, represents additional income that we have not yet recorded but expect to record over time due to our improved payment expectations on our successfully modified PCI loans.", "We turn to expenses on the merger side, merger expenses and cost saves. We remain on track to achieve the $5 billion of annual run rate savings from the consolidation that we estimated at the time of the merger. We achieved approximately $2.9 billion of cost saves in 2009 and we expect to achieve the remaining integration saves when integration is completed by year-end 2011.", "We had originally estimated that we will spend $7.9 billion in integration costs cumulatively over the three years necessary to achieve these savings, but we now estimate we won\u2019t need to spend more than $5 billion. That\u2019s because we are seeing lower severance and retention costs, lower property disposition cost, and lower contractor and lender expenses than we originally thought.", "In 2009, we spent a total of $2.1 billion on integration, $1.2 billion of which went through goodwill under purchase accounting and $895 million was expensed to earnings. In the fourth quarter, $654 million was charged to goodwill and $450 million was expensed, up from $200 million in the third quarter, primarily because of an expected increase in business and systems integration projects and severance costs related to team member displacements.", "The severance cost expense in the fourth quarter related to exit plans for legacy Wells Fargo team members, whereas severance cost for legacy Wachovia team members under purchase accounting was charged to goodwill throughout 2009. Starting in 2010, all future integration costs will be expensed. And we expect the merger savings we realize in 2010 to largely offset the 2010 estimated merger integration expenses.", "As we have spent this money so far this past year, we accomplished a great deal of business and system integration. We completed the re-branding at our brokerage capital markets mortgage and insurance businesses. We successfully converted our first banking state Colorado and our five remaining overlap states will be converted in 2010.", "In addition, we worked on integrating technology platforms throughout our banking stores that laid the groundwork for the systems conversions that will take place over the next two years. Replaced over 500 Wachovia ATMs and Envelope-Free ATMs throughout our banking space. Our ATM network, which has been available to both Wells Fargo and Wachovia customers throughout the year, processed over 5 million cross-company transactions in 2009.", "The average legacy Wells Fargo retail banking store serves roughly 20% more households than the average Wachovia store, but has 70% more platform bankers serving customers. During 2009, we hired and shifted more than 1,250 additional platform banker FTEs to serve customers in legacy Wachovia stores. And we expect this will further align the Wachovia stores to the banking model used by Wells Fargo and help drive cross-sell. We plan to continue to add bankers in 2010.", "When we priced the Wachovia merger, we did not assume any revenue synergies, but we have already begun to realize tremendous synergies across our businesses. Let me give you a couple of examples. Our mortgage market share is usually higher in states where we have a banking presence, and we have already realized market share gains in the Wachovia banking states.", "Before the merger a year ago, we ranked number one in eight Wachovia banking states where Wells Fargo did not have banking stores, and we currently rank number one in a total of ten Wachovia banking states and number two or number three in the remaining banking states. Our international group is one of the largest providers of foreign exchange services, transacting more than $4 trillion in notional trade volume each year.", "Prior to the merger, Wells Fargo and Wachovia were both big in international banking, but in combination, the company has a broader set of products and services to offer more customers, with offices in more than 35 overseas locations, and serving customers in more than 130 countries. We are now the third largest trade processor for other banks that do business overseas, processing more than 65,000 payments a day and $36 trillion a year.", "Another example, investment banking and sales and trading activities, which had strong revenue growth throughout 2009, as we combine Wachovia\u2019s origination and distribution with the client relationships both banks had, resulting in market share gains for Wells Fargo. We now rank number four in loan syndications and number six in total equity.", "Additionally, we were book runner or lead manager in over 50% of the deals we participated in during 2009. As we continue serving the capital raising and advisory needs of our middle market, large corporate and municipal customers, along with the product needs of our institutional and retail investing customers, we expect to increase our share of the customer flow portion of the investment banking business.", "We have actively reduced the risk associated with Wachovia\u2019s highest risk loans and securities portfolios. For example, since year-end 2008, through pay-downs, charge-offs and sales, we\u2019ve reduced the size of our non-strategic consumer loans, including Pick-A-Pay, indirect home equity, indirect auto, in total by almost $19 billion or 15%.", "We reduced the size of these loans by $4.7 billion in just the fourth quarter. We would expect to continue to see the size of this portfolio shrink in the future. In addition, we reduced the size of the non-strategic commercial real estate portfolio by $2.9 billion in 2009.", "On the other side of the balance sheet, Wachovia had $136 billion of high rate CDs on their balance sheet at the end of last year \u2013 that's the end of 2008. In 2009, $109 billion of those matured, including $14 billion in the fourth quarter. 57% of these deposits were retained in lower cost checking, savings and CDs. $8 billion of Wachovia\u2019s high rate CDs, largely the balance of the original amount, will mature in 2010. We\u2019ve had great success from deposits across the company this year, with average checking and savings account balances increasing 20% annualized linked-quarter.", "Let me conclude with a few remarks about our strong balance sheet and capital position. With loans down $82 billion and core deposits up $35 billion this past year, we are more liquid than we have ever been and have significant capacity to extend credit without having to increase leverage, because we already have the liquidity on the company\u2019s balance sheet.", "Our mix of deposits has improved with lower rate checking and savings deposits now accounting for 87% of total core deposits, up from 76% at year-end 2008. Since we hardly issued any term debt under the FDIC guaranteed debt programs last year, unlike many of our large peers, and since we had previously lengthened our debt maturities, we only have about $20 billion of holding company debt maturing in any of the next three years. That\u2019s roughly half the maturities per year of our three largest peer banks, leaving us in a much more flexible financing position.", "We also have significant capacity to add to our securities portfolio, as I mentioned before, should long-term yields increase. Our approach in securities has always been to keep our loan duration MBS portfolio roughly in line with our large and growing base of longer duration core deposits and to invest when long-term yields are high, not when the carry trade looks good.", "In effect, we are currently giving up current income to preserve the flexibility to add to the portfolio at higher rates for even more income going forward. Of course, should interest rates fall, the unrealized gain in our bond portfolio already nearly $5 billion at today\u2019s interest rates and spreads should go up. And of course, in that particular interest rate environment, the mortgage business would likely have even better economics.", "We built credit reserves by $3.5 billion in 2009, including $500 million in the fourth quarter. The allowance for credit losses now totals $25 billion, six times what it was at the start of the credit crisis and reaching 3.2% of loans. While 3.2% is below some of our large peers, there is a reason for that. We believe we have a better underwritten loan portfolio. And in addition to the reported reserves, as you know, we also provided $40.9 billion through purchase accounting for the life-of-loan losses in our purchased credit-impaired portfolio, of which $22.9 billion remains.", "With respect to capital, legacy Wells Fargo always maintained industry-leading capital ratios and we also maintained a capital structure largely independent of hybrids and structured capital unlike many of our peers. With our strong internal capital generation and the actions we have taken to issue common equity, our capital ratios are now higher than they were prior to the Wachovia acquisition, even after repaying TARP in full and buying PRU's share of the retail securities brokerage business.", "So we are ending 2009 with a customer base and geographic reach at least double what it was a year ago prior to the merger, with all the financial resources in place to properly serve that larger base of customers for future revenue, earnings and capital generation.", "And with that, I\u2019d like to now open up the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor.", "Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning.", "Howard Atkins", "Good morning, Matt.", "Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "First question is on the mortgage business. And I guess I always think about two pieces, the core business, which seems to be doing well and the pipeline strong heading into 1Q, and then the hedging part of it. And if I recall, I think you basically said as long as the yield curve stays steep and you keep the current hedge on, we can expect continued hedge gains. And I guess I just want to circle back on that if we can expect additional gains going forward.", "Howard Atkins", "First I\u2019d like to say, as I mentioned before, we do manage this very holistically. So separating the products is not necessarily the best way to looking at the business in terms of how we manage the hedge. But the \u2013 as I said, if short-term rates remain low and you can make up your own \u2013 you have your own forecast about that, that does contribute to the run rate earnings on the hedge. And finally, this is a very dynamic process. We adjust the hedge daily. As you would expect, this is a very big portfolio and should our views on rates change and our estimates on what rate changes may do to both sides of the business change, we could very well decide the amount that we hedge. So \u2013 a complicated answer, but this is very dynamic. Short-term rates should remain low for a while. Net-net, that should be a plus to the profitability of the business.", "Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. And then separately, with you acquiring the remaining stake of Prudential joint venture, the earnings stream, I assume, kicks in this quarter?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, that is correct, Matt.", "Howard Atkins", "So we have 100% of the earnings of the business now.", "Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "And remind us what the annual pickup in earnings will be from that.", "Howard Atkins", "We haven\u2019t disclosed that amount. It will be what it will be.", "Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay.", "John Stumpf", "But their interest is about 23% of the business. And all the earnings plus all the cross-sell and so forth accrues to our shareholder.", "Matt O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Matt.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Quick question here on capital markets. Given the resurgence of the Glass-Steagall arguments, could you just speak to sort of the breadth of your capital markets operations here? And if indeed you ever had to split them off, would it be a big loss?", "John Stumpf", "Good morning, Nancy. This is John. With the merger of Wachovia, we are a much larger commercial bank. And one of the great assets we got as part of the merger was a terrific team of folks from Wachovia in investment banking business. I view this as additional product, a way for us to add service to those customers who are already doing business with. Some of the proposals that I have seen, and who knows what\u2019s going happen, about going back to the future or splitting something off or requiring additional capital tends to be for those riskier parts of the investment banking business, proprietary kinds of lending, structured activity, I\u2019ve not heard much about splitting the baby around the so-called flow business, which we think is where we can add value to our customers. But who knows what\u2019s going to happen, but I don\u2019t \u2013 whatever happens surely would have a smaller impact in this company than our peer group.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Could you just remind us what parts of the capital markets businesses basically have been downsized or shut down since you took them over from Wachovia?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, they had activities that did not, for the most part, start with customers and relationships. And most of the things that we kept and are actually growing and developing start with the customer. And it\u2019s customer-focused. Yes, but didn\u2019t have that, just started with the customer, we\u2019ve tended to not grow that or actually shrink that or get out of some of those businesses.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Okay. And just as a final question, could you just update us, John? I mean, we\u2019ve seen all the numbers for the Wachovia integration, but what has actually started to happen at the Wachovia branch level as far as cross-selling products, et cetera, because here in New Jersey it\u2019s sort of not really visible yet?", "John Stumpf", "Yes. Well, it will be coming to New Jersey. Every day we get one day closer to that. As I think Howard mentioned, I think you know, this process will likely take us three years, give or take. The first year we spent a lot of time on the plumbing and wiring, getting teams in place, and we did do one overlapping market. Those are the one you need to do first because you have Wachovia and Wells\u2019 customers most doing retail business in the same market. So \u2013 and we are going to finish the rest of the overlapping early \u2013 or during this year, and we will get to some of the eastern markets later this year and then you will see the big push from a signage perspective in the east later this year and next year. But even before that, we have \u2013 we are increasing the number of bankers in the stores. We are learning from each other about great sales and great service. But I think the notice will change, as we probably will come to New Jersey. You will see more of that at the time of the actual changeover.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "And there is no pressure at this point to \u2013 you know, given the sort of competitive nature of the business to accelerate that sort of cross-selling timeframe et cetera?", "John Stumpf", "Well, actually, Nancy, I looked at our numbers for the fourth quarter and I am more than pleasantly -- in fact I\u2019m thrilled about how the quality of our \u2013 of the folks on the East, if you will, legacy Wachovia and the proficiency of their cross-sell and their selling, they are coming from a lower sales base largely because they have not enough bankers in their stores. But if you take sales per banker, I am thrilled with what we are seeing. So \u2013 and we have more opportunity there because the holding \u2013 the product holdings by those retail households is less than what it is on the Wells\u2019 side, it's a huge opportunity. And that\u2019s only one part of the business. I mean, we\u2019ve \u2013 on the middle market and the wholesale side, there is a lots of terrific things happening in the East, but I know people tend to focus when you think about stores on the retail side.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Okay. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning.", "Howard Atkins", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Hi, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi. Couple of questions. One is on capital and obviously you did raise capital, got out of TARP last quarter. Could you just give us a sense as to how much credit you\u2019ve got? You think you got from the regulators in the losses that you had booked upfront with the WB transaction. In other words, did you get credit for those losses in the calculation in your opinion?", "John Stumpf", "I\u2019d say it this way, Betsy. We know, as we look at our own balance sheet and capital, that typically we have less risk than many of our large peer banks. And one of the areas we have less risk is because we\u2019ve already taken the hit on the PCI portfolio when we did the merger. That concept does form the basis of how we talk to the world, including regulators, about our company and how much capital we need as an organization. So I can\u2019t tell you whether any specific numerical amount was taken into account, but the fact that we have so de-risked, we've taken so much risk out of the Wachovia portfolio, certainly in our view, and we believe in the people we talk to, it does form part of the basis of how much capital is adequate for this company.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then as you outlined, at the margin credits getting less bad because of some better than initially affected outcomes in some of the portfolios, right, that you bought from WB, could you give us a sense as to how you are thinking about capital generation and reallocation? I mean, what kind of trigger points do you need to see to either reinvest more aggressively or to distribute capital to shareholders?", "John Stumpf", "Well, I would \u2013 Betsy, I\u2019d say it this way. This company has had a long history of growing capital organically, which is always the best way. And as we look at capital \u2013 the first calling capital in my mind is to grow the business and fortify the balance sheet, and then we surely want to distribute \u201cexcess capital\u201d to our shareholders. Dividends is one way to do that.", "One of the toughest decisions we had to make last year was cutting our dividend. We surely want to get back to a more appropriate dividend level as soon as practical. Of course, that\u2019s a decision that is with the Board, and I\u2019m sure they are going to want to see or at least consider and take into their consideration a turn in the economy or some positive signs and so forth. But as you look at capital, as Howard mentioned, I think you need to look at the risk of the organization, we have \u2013 we are not in a lot of the risk businesses. We don\u2019t have big trading account and so forth. This is a community-oriented, customer-focused kind of business that we do. And also we are not na\u00efve to what other levels of capital are around the world frankly. And so we will just see how things go, but we are comfortable with our capital position and we\u2019re surely comfortable with the way we\u2019re growing capital today.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. I mean, obviously you\u2019ve got some proposals out from Basel at the end of the year. How much \u2013 have you taken a look at those? And is there any \u2013 maybe you would do differently with the business model based on what\u2019s being proposed?", "Howard Atkins", "Yes. That\u2019s very preliminary.", "John Stumpf", "That\u2019s 2012 and \u2013", "Howard Atkins", "Obviously, we take a look at all those stuff, but it would be highly speculative to even comment on that.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just lastly on the bank tax that\u2019s been suggested, is this something that you would just pass through to shareholders or do you think that there is any ways that you could potentially offset some of those?", "John Stumpf", "Let me answer it this way. First of all, we were invited in the TARP. We\u2019ve repaid our TARP. It\u2019s been a very good return to the Treasury and the taxpayer. In addition to that, we have made more loans, and we have not only paid it back, we\u2019ve also honored the spirit of the investment to make loans to help the economy going. And as I talked with our shareholders, other people who are interested in our company, team members, customers, our stakeholders, they are talking to me about jobs. And I don\u2019t understand how additional taxes or a fee disguised as tax at this time helps with growing jobs.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And you do have a question from the line of Paul Miller.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Yes. Thank you very much. We\u2019ve seen the housing markets starting to stabilize here and we do know there is a lot of government programs, the government buying mortgage-backed securities in the FHA program, which you saw today that they are going to up some of the down payment and fees on lower FICO scores. How do you think \u2013 I mean, how much \u2013 we know the government is supporting the housing market, but how stable do you think it really is? And how much pullback can the government do to keep this market where it is today?", "John Stumpf", "Paul, I \u2013 I don\u2019t know. All I know is that all rates have benefited consumers, as we have helped them last year refinance or modify 1.5 million homeowners. And I think your guess is probably as good as mine as what the government might or might not do with respect to supporting housing especially on the long end by buying mortgages. So customers are still buying homes. They are still refinancing. They have needs. We are there serving them and we will serve them whether the rates are little higher or lower, whether the government is more involved or less involved. It is fairly dynamic right now.", "Bob Strickland", "Operator, any other questions? If not, perhaps we\u2019ll just conclude the call.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And you do have a question from the line of Andrew Marquardt. Andrew, please state your question.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Hi, guys. Can you hear me?", "John Stumpf", "Yes. Hi, Andrew.", "Howard Atkins", "Hi, Andrew.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Can you guys go back to your credit quality comments talking about 2010, expecting to see peak credit losses with consumer first in the first half and then commercial in the back half? Can you elaborate a little bit about that as well as maybe give some color in terms of will provision costs correlate with those peakings or should we also expect some reserve build to continue?", "Howard Atkins", "Well, again, as we said last quarter, consumer early in the year, commercial later in the year. I guess, the only slight nuance we\u2019d say is that where we see things peaking a little bit later rather than a little bit earlier, it would be more in the real estate secured portfolios, consumer and commercial rather than the other portfolios. The C&I portfolio, for example, is actually in very good shape right now.", "As I indicated, non-accruals are down and losses are remaining pretty low. And we are seeing peaking already in a number of the other consumer portfolios. Reserve build is a tougher question to answer. Obviously we don\u2019t provide guidance around that. Obviously we think that the allowance that we had at the end of the year was adequate for the portfolio. But again, this is dynamic. A lot is going to depend on which particular quarter things peak, what the trajectory is after the peak on the way down, so on and so forth. So we feel comfortable with the allowance. We\u2019ll have to see each quarter as we go forward.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Is it fair to assume that on the commercial side as NPAs continue to rise or kind of problem assets internally rated, downgraded that reserve build really should continue?", "Howard Atkins", "Well, again, if you \u2013 the point is that commercial real estate peaks a little later and consumer a little earlier. Obviously on the commercial side, that in isolation keeps some pressure on reserving. On the other side, the consumer goes the other way. So really it\u2019s going to depend on how each of these portfolios plays out quarter-by-quarter going forward.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Okay. Thanks. And then my second and last question was on the accretable yield balance. I think it\u2019s now $14.6 billion. You mentioned that\u2019s going to be realized over the remaining life of the loans. Can you give a sense of how long that might be and if we should really expect \u2013 I think you should it was \u2013 the quarterly impact this quarter was $6.10 billion. Is that what we should kind of think about as a run rate or how do we think about that playing out? Thanks.", "Howard Atkins", "Well, again, most of the \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say it. Most of the 6.10 in the quarter or the sort of $2 billion-plus that we recorded in 2009 is in fact the yield on that portfolio. So most of that does carry forward for a period of time. Obviously the portfolio matures, things get (inaudible) in the portfolio, and we can add to that as we continue to improve \u2013 if we continue to improve our estimates of the future losses and continue to modify loans. But \u2013 so a fair chunk of that is kind of run rate in nature, given the qualifications I just gave you. And as to the remaining life, as you would expect, Andrew, there are portfolios in the total PCI portfolio, which mature over a variety of timeframes. Of course, the big piece of that is the Pick-A-Pay portfolio and that has a relatively longer duration.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mandel [ph].", "Ron Mandel", "Hi. Yes. I \u2013", "John Stumpf", "Ron, we can\u2019t hear you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hey, just a follow-up question on rates, I just wanted to understand, Howard, how you\u2019re thinking about the impact of the Fed exit on the fixed income market and how you\u2019re planning on managing the balance sheet for that.", "Howard Atkins", "Well, that\u2019s a good question, Betsy. And the Fed obviously is active in buying MBSs. And despite the fact that the yield curve is as positively sloped as it right now, their active purchases is a factor that is in some senses artificially keeping long MBS yields lower than they might otherwise be. At some point, presumably they will either gradually or more quickly reverse course and that could lead to an increase in interest rates. And as I mentioned a couple of times in my remarks, in possible preparation for that, we have been keeping our powder dry in effect under-investing this large base of core deposits that we have for the possibility that that reverses course.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So you might get some OCI [ph] hit near-term, but dry powder leads you to a better outlook for earnings. Is that the way to think about it?", "Howard Atkins", "Yes. Again, while the mortgage business is showing good results right now, in effect on the portfolio side, the investment portfolio, we in effect are giving up some current income. We don\u2019t believe in the carry trade, and we do want to preserve some powder in case rates do go up and we will have the powder at that point where we will invest the powder at that point to offset some \u2013 whatever is going on in the mortgage business.", "John Stumpf", "Betsy, actually this as the classic short-term view of the business or long-term view of the business. 400 basis points or something like that, which we make in the carry trade today, is very attractive. But we think it\u2019s the wrong decision long-term because we think the bias is for higher rates, not for lower rates, and we\u2019re willing to wait for that to happen. We think that\u2019s the better trade.", "Howard Atkins", "But rather than believing the point, we are effectively giving up 400 basis points today for possibly a year or so, maybe plus or minus, to avoid the potential risk of a large number of basis points for 30 years. So the last thing we want to do is get stuck with \u2013", "John Stumpf", "Correct.", "Howard Atkins", "\u2013 with the securities at these low levels of interest rates.", "John Stumpf", "Because \u2013 I think when rates move, they are probably going to move at some speed and I don\u2019t think there is going to be maybe a quarter. It could be \u2013 it could be more than that and it could happen relatively quickly.", "Howard Atkins", "Also, Betsy, this is the same thing that we did back in 2002, 2003, when interest rates were also at cyclical low points just before they went up a lot. So this is \u2013 what we\u2019re doing now is not very different from the way the company has always managed itself.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. That\u2019s good color. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hey, guys. A question on the mortgage business. I was wondering how much the expense base of your mortgage business is variable and gives you flexibility to manage the slowdown in originations.", "Howard Atkins", "I don\u2019t have a precise ratio for you, John. But as you know, we manage the mortgage business with a reasonably high content of variable expense. And we do that by design. The mortgage \u2013 the people manage our mortgage business have been in this business for the last five cycles, 20 years plus. And we know there is a cycle to the mortgage business. And as a result, we try to keep the expense base of the business as variable as we can keep it. And as you know, the way we\u2019ve done that in the past is when we start seeing applications rise quickly, typically we are adding part timers and peak timers rather than full-time staff, and that gives the ability to move the other way if production slows down.", "John Stumpf", "And John, you know, all of the producers are on commissions. So that\u2019s all variable.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "All right. All right. Okay. And again, on the servicing side, don\u2019t need a number, but just a feel for things. Are the servicing margins getting hit now by the high cost of servicing, modifications, collections? Is that a meaningful impact on your servicing margins at this point?", "Howard Atkins", "It is an expense, John. I wouldn\u2019t call it necessarily meaningful, but what\u2019s meaningful is if we have devoted significant resources to the modification process. We have 15,000 people now dedicated to doing that. That\u2019s the right thing to do for the customer. We want to keep the customer in the home, and we want to work through all this. And I\u2019d also say finally, we factor any of the costs that we incur in this business are in fact factored into our MSR.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And then just on NII, just your high-level thoughts on growth or shrinkage in the balance sheet, given the challenge of finding loan demand, your cautious stance about securities and then the run-off portfolio, is that a big challenge to find growth in the balance sheet as you look out over the next year or two?", "John Stumpf", "John, I would \u2013 we've been dealing with that for some time now. And if you look at 2009, we\u2019ve had a lot of challenges and we have \u2013 we are hiring more people. There are more feet in the street. We are doing a double look on loans that we turn down to make sure that we\u2019re turning them down for the right reason. And I think that will be a challenge for the industry in 2010 until economy turns around.", "Now with respect to Wells uniquely, our business model, the fact we have 80-some different horses pulling the coach and that we have such great balance\u00a0between where our revenue comes from, half from non-interest income, the other half from net interest income, and the geographic diversity we have and some of the new businesses that we are in that we have \u2013 we are still sub-optimized we can grow. But I am not saying this can be easy, but we surely \u2013 we believe we can outperform on a relative basis in that area.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And just one final follow-up on that, Howard. Could you just give us a couple sense of the puts and takes on the net interest margin factors that will \u2013 positive and negative that kind of influence the outlook on margin as we look ahead.", "Howard Atkins", "Well, there is lots of puts and takes, including growth in the left hand side of the balance sheet and growth in the right hand side of the balance sheet. Interesting phenomenon in the fourth quarter, we did tick down a couple of BPs in the margin. But interestingly, that in effect was because we had such good deposit growth in the quarter in combination with the loans that were coming off. So the \u2013 because of the large deposit growth, the size of the asset base actually remained relatively constant even as loans were declining and that actually diluted the margin a little bit.", "So that\u2019s just one fact. I think two \u2013 I guess my two important points on the margin would be, one, we should continue to have a higher margin than the other big banks in the country because we have such an incredible deposit base. As I mentioned, 87% of our deposits are now in low-cost checking and savings. And that\u2019s growing rather than shrinking. So that\u2019s a good factor. And secondly, as I said before, there's lots of factors going up and down. If loan demand reemerges, we may see a decline in the margin, but that would be good for income. So our focus here is really on net interest income per se, not the margin per se.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And again, the reason the deposit growth in the fourth quarter was just that you invested it in low-yielding liquid stuff?", "Howard Atkins", "In fact, not by design, but basically the combination of loans coming down a little bit. Normally if loans come down and your deposits are shrinking, you may not actually get a diminution in the margin. But if your loans are coming down and your deposits are growing, the incremental asset \u2013 your assets are not shrinking even though your loan income is going down. So you get a little bit of a diminution in the margin as a result.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning, John and Howard.", "John Stumpf", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Couple things. First, just following up on Nancy\u2019s question, given the three-year timeframe you talked about for the integration, when can we expect to see the gap narrow between the two companies, retail household cross-sell ratios? And separately, maybe you can talk a bit more about some of the cross-sell progress on the wholesale side?", "John Stumpf", "I think we\u2019ve mentioned that the \u2013 in our release, that the difference is on the legacy Wells side, it is 5.95. On the Wachovia side, it\u2019s 4.70, in that range. So there is a delta. It doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but you multiply that times 11 million or 12 million households, it\u2019s a lot of products. I can\u2019t give you an exact timeframe as to when that will close, but the way you close it is by adding more people to the Wachovia stores and frankly sharing ideas and working together as one team. So that will close. I think the more interesting thing is, on the Wells side, we are not stopping. In fact, our cross-sell is actually accelerating. We went from 5.73 to 5.95 on the retail side. We grew by almost a quarter of a product per household over the whole fleet in one year, which is tremendous. And that\u2019s because of the great service that we\u2019re providing in the stores.", "On the commercial side, if you look at the legacy Wachovia business in the middle market, it\u2019s all \u2013 you know, that business we like a lot and we are making good progress there in fact. The wholesale side happens to be the cross-sell champions in the company. So we have a new business model on the East in place this quarter. We are seeing good progress. We are working together with each other. So, of all the things I worry about, that\u2019s about the last one. There is great \u2013 there are cards and letters going back and forth between the company and each other of how to improve in this area and we\u2019re winning every day.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks. And then at this point, do you have much interest in pursuing smaller FDIC-assisted transactions to fill in your franchise? And if so, what markets are of the highest priority or interest to you?", "John Stumpf", "The highest priority I have right now is do Wachovia really, really well. And it \u2013 I never say never to anything. But you\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve done nothing this past year on the banking side. And frankly, when we put \u2013 when we get this all done, we will have, I believe, the best franchise with more stores in the biggest economy in the world, not to be replicated, it\u2019s just that unique. Are there couple places that we would like something more? Sure. But I view those as \u2013 of the top 20 MSAs in the country, we are number one in ten of those. So we have dominant share, and I\u2019ll worry about that sometime later, but all hands are on deck getting Wachovia done really, really well.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks, John.", "John Stumpf", "All right. We are going to be \u2013 is there \u2013", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s Q&A portion of today\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.", "John Stumpf", "I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I appreciate your interest in our company, and we will see you in 90 days from now. Thank you much.", "Howard Atkins", "Thank you, everyone.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s Wells Fargo fourth quarter earnings conference call.

(Operator instructions) I would now like to turn today\u2019s call over to Mr. Bob Strickland. Please go ahead, sir.", "Bob Strickland", "Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and CFO, Howard Atkins will review first quarter 2010 results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplements are available on our Website. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call and that those forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.", "Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today and the earnings release and quarterly supplement included as exhibits. In addition, some of the discussion today about the company\u2019s performance will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can be found in our SEC filings and in the earnings release and quarterly supplement available on our Website at wellsfargo.com.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thanks Bob and thanks to everyone who has joined us on this call. We appreciate your interest in Wells Fargo. Before I turn this over to Howard Atkins for a more in-depth review of our results this quarter, let me review some highlights from the quarter and why I am excited about how Wells Fargo is positioned for the future.", "Our first quarter results reflect underlying strength, with revenue growth that demonstrates the power of our diversified business model and combined franchise. In fact, during the challenging economic environment of the past couple of years, which continues to affect employment, housing values, loan demand and interest rates, we have been afforded a great opportunity to clearly demonstrate how well our business model works for our customers and for shareholders, not matter what the economic conditions are.", "This wasn\u2019t by chance, but reflects the benefit of our longstanding focus on diversification. Our team has continued to meet our customers\u2019 financial needs, while pulling together to make our merger with Wachovia, the largest in US banking history a success. Over the past year, we have completed a tremendous amount of work behind the scenes, choosing and enhancing systems and products, aligning jobs and completing detailed integration plans. So, we are now well prepared for the more visible work you will see happening this year and next.", "Today, we have converted a number of business lines including mortgage and credit card and four of our overlapping banking states, and we are preparing to complete the California conversion this weekend. Texas, our last overlapping state would be converted in July. Our eastern states would be converting in the third quarter and we are on schedule to complete all conversions by the end of 2011 as we have planned.", "This merger has been a team effort and our entire team is working exceptionally well together. Culturally and financially, this merger is exceeding my expectations and I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the opportunities ahead. At this point, we believe we have turned the corner on many of the credit challenges of the past two years. Throughout this economic downturn, we have continued to lend to our customers, but customer demand and therefore earnings asset growth remains soft. Against this backdrop, it\u2019s important to note that we remain firmly committed to our discipline in managing credit risks and interest rate risks and to managing our company for long-term earnings growth, not short-term quarterly results.", "In short, we believe we have had demonstrable success throughout these tough economic times and we positioned our franchise well for better economic times ahead. We have held on to customers by providing a full spectrum of products and services to meet their needs throughout this period. We have dominant market positions in consumer, commercial, retail brokerage and other key business areas. We have a tremendous nationwide distribution network. In other words, Wells Fargo has proven to have the right business model and it\u2019s right where it needs to be to be successful going forward.", "In our view, while the US economy is gradually regaining its footing, it has yet to deliver a broad base recovery for our country and for many of our customers. Though the signs of strength we are seeing in the economy are encouraging, we are not counting on them alone to deliver the performance you come to expect from Wells Fargo. I am confident our company will continue to find and leverage opportunities that are unique to our diversified business model, our valued customer relationships and our disciplined approach to managing our balance sheet.", "Now, let me turn this over to Howard Atkins, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Howard Atkins", "Thank you John. My remarks will follow the presentation that\u2019s included in the first quarter quarterly supplement that\u2019s available on the Wells Fargo Investor Relations Website, and I am going to focus in on first quarter earnings, capital and credit.", "Slide 3 of that presentation provides a high-level summary of the key messages about our first quarter. There are essentially three things I would like you all to take away from our first quarter results. First, we are very pleased with the $2.5 billion profit that was earned in the quarter, and the reason more pleased with the way that those results were achieved. Our earnings were broad-based. Each major business segment earned money and each contributed to the overall earnings results. Businesses as diverse as trusted invested, debit card, merchant processing, insurance, asset-based lending, real estate brokerage, all had very strong revenue growth year-over-year.", "In essence, as we think about our earnings, our earnings continued to come from core retail and commercial banking. Less than 3% of our total revenue this quarter was from trading and market-sensitive income and less than 5% of our total revenue was from net mortgage hedging results.", "Second message is that credit appears to have turned the corner. When we look back at this period, we will likely mark the third quarter of 2009 as the peak in provision expense and the fourth quarter of 2009 as the peak in charge-offs. Provision expense, charge-offs, early-staged delinquencies, low rates on both the impaired and unimpaired Pick-a-Pay portfolios, and inflows to non-accruals all continued to show improvement in the first quarter, in both the total consumer and total commercial portfolios. In part, this is related to the gradual improvement we have seen in housing and labor markets, but this largely reflects the actions we have taken, beginning almost three years ago to reduce risk and reduce loss in our loan portfolios.", "And our third message is we continue to build capital in the quarter. Our balance sheet, which has always been very strong, has never been as strong as it is right now. So, let me delve into these key messages a little bit more detail on slide 4. You can see that we earned again over $2.5 billion in net income after tax in the first quarter. That equates to $2.37 billion net income to common, roughly in line with the net income available to common we earned in the first quarter of 2009, which was a record at that time, and we earned that even with the decline in loans and increase in merger integration expenses from last year.", "Diluted earnings per share of course in the quarter was $0.45. We have always had among the best operating margins among large peers and we continue to do so in the first quarter, as you can see on slide 5. One of the key metrics we look at is return on assets. This is metric we have growth, operating margin, and risk discipline all meet. We have always had one of the highest return on assets among large peers and we once again had among the highest in the first quarter at 84 basis points.", "We would like to see our return on assets closer to the 1.5% we have earned historically. Our return on assets is typically higher than our peers for four reasons. First, our net interest margin tends to be higher, our NIM was 4.27% in the first quarter, up 11 basis points year-over-year, largely reflecting the fact that we continue to experience very strong growth in checking and savings deposits, which were up 12% year-over-year. Secondly, we tend to have lower credit loss rate on our loan portfolio, because of our strong underwriting discipline and the concentration of our loan portfolio in lower loss rate real estate secured loans. Third, we tend to have very positive operating leverage. Our efficiency ratio in the quarter was 56.5%, in line with the prior quarter\u2019s post-Wachovia\u2019s acquisition. And fourth, a high proportion of our total revenue comes from fee income, which is less asset-intensive, and this derives from the cross-sell model that we have always had in the company.", "Our business model also generates internally lots of new capital, which is why we have among the highest ROEs among large commercial bank peers, even as our total capital increases. Now, we have always been committed to maintaining a strong capital position for growth that\u2019s consistent with our risk profile. As you can see on slide 6, our capital ratios are now higher than pre-Wachovia and pre-TARP levels, while at the same time, we are a more balanced, more diverse, less risky company with Wachovia in the mix. We are certainly more diversified geographically by customer segment and by source of income.", "Our capital ratios have been growing rapidly because our business model produces such a high rate of internal capital generation. In the first quarter, we added 60 basis points Tier 1 common, all internally generated. As I see it, we have never been better positioned in terms of our balance sheet strength. Our Tier 1 capital is now at $98 billion. Our allowance for credit reserves is now at $26 billion. The remaining non-accretable difference for purchase credit impaired loans is almost $20 billion, mortgage repurchase reserve is $1.3 billion, and we have $7.4 billion of unrealized gains in our available-for-sale securities portfolio.", "We are more liquid and have greater capacity to add assets that at any time in my tenure as the CFO of this company. We would love to see more loan demand or add more securities, but we are not willing to compromise our underwriting or pricing requirements or add long-term securities that what we believe to be low long-term yields.", "Now, despite a 7% decline in loans year-over-year, our total revenue is actually up 2%. There are four reasons for this increase as I see it. First, our NIM as I mentioned before was up 11 basis points. That\u2019s a function of strong deposit growth, and the strong composition of checking and savings that we have in our overall deposit mix. Secondly, as John mentioned, we are already realizing revenue synergies from the Wachovia acquisition, cross-sell is going up at Wachovia. We have got a broader distribution of core banking products through Wachovia\u2019s powerful financial advisor channel, and the application of Wachovia\u2019s product set to the Wells Fargo customer base is also adding revenue.", "Third, the breadth of our business model clearly contributes to our overall revenue. Other revenue sources of course made up for the decline in lending income, including trust and investment fees, which were up 20%, insurance revenue up 7%, and processing and other fees up 14%. The fourth, underpinning all of the above, is the continued growth in cross-sell in our company. So, on cross-sell, the retail banking business achieved record sales of 7.81 million solutions, sales in other words in the first quarter, up 16% from a year ago, and also record cross-sell, which crossed six products per household on average.", "Now, keep in mind that this increase in the average products per household has been occurring on a growing base of households, in other words productivity is going up as well as deeper product penetration. One of the main opportunities from the Wachovia merger was to deepen customer relationships at Wachovia through cross-sell. When we acquired Wachovia, we estimated that the retail cross-sell was about 4.5 products on average compared with Wells Fargo\u2019s 5.8. So, getting Wachovia just the way Wells Fargo was a year ago, represent about a 30% lift to revenue from Wachovia\u2019s retail customer base, which is roughly the same size as the legacy Wells Fargo customer base. By trying Wells Fargo\u2019s retail business model to be east footprint, we are well on our way to realizing that opportunity. Legacy Wachovia cross-sell increased from 4.55 products to 4.85 products, which helped drive the overall company\u2019s revenue growth year-over-year.", "Slide 9 shows you our loans, coupled with key points on this. First, we continue to supply large amounts of credit to the US economy, over $128 billion in new originations and loan commitments just in the first quarter of 2010, but as John indicated, loan demand overall remains soft. Now, we did see some signs of growth in loans in some portfolios. Auto loans for example increased 14% linked-quarter annualized, student loans increased 13% linked-quarter annualized, and anecdotally, we are also experiencing more conversations at least with commercial customers about their potential credit needs, but fundamentally, we don\u2019t expect material new loan demand until (inaudible) really takes hold.", "Fortunately and typically when that happens, Wells Fargo tends to get the first shot at the loan, because the customer already has all its other non-credit businesses realized. When we acquired Wachovia, we committed to aggressively reduce the higher risk non-strategic assets that we inherited from Wachovia, and as you can see on slide 10, we have continued to do that. Reducing the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, indirect home equity, and Wells Fargo\u2019s indirect auto portfolios a combined $23 billion or about 20% since the merger. To put that in context, about a third of the decline we have experienced in our total loan portfolio since acquiring Wachovia is from our actions to reduce risk, not from reduced loans.", "On deposits, slide 11, we continue to get great deposit growth. We mentioned success in deposits in one fashion by looking at how our net gain, other words, net new checking accounts, net new checking accounts are up 7% year-over-year for the company. And in fact, in two important markets, one in the West Coast, California; one in the East Coast, New Jersey, those markets are experiencing net gain growth that\u2019s well above the average across our footprint. Period-end checking and savings deposit balances were up 12% year-over-year, and very importantly, 88% of our core deposits are now in the form of checking and savings accounts. So, we continue to appear to be the bank of choice of our consumer and business customers to place their operating balances.", "We now have run-off almost all of Wachovia\u2019s higher rate CDs, with only about $5 billion maturing in 2010 and throughout this process including the first quarter of 2010, we were very successful in retaining those deposits into lower rate checking, savings and CDs. Comment on expenses, slide 12, as you can see, our operating expenses were relatively flat year-over-year. When we think about expenses in the company, essentially we break down into three important missions from managing expenses. First, we are endeavoring to achieve the targeted consolidation expense savings. We calculate that we have already realized about 70% of the annualized savings on an annualized run rate basis.", "In the first quarter of 2010, we incurred $380 million of integration costs, that\u2019s up from $205 million a year ago, and we expect to incur approximately $2 billion in integration costs during 2010, roughly in line with our original expectations. We are entering the more challenging part of the integration as John mentioned before. But so far, we have achieved all of the milestones, everything is on schedule and we still expect to realize the $5 billion in run rate saves, systems and store conversions are fully completed in late 2011.", "The second mission is on problem loans. We are diligently but quickly resolving problem loans in foreclosed assets. We have reviewed, resolving problems as quickly as we can and ultimately reducing the costs that are connected with the resolution process. Costs connected with credit resolution were up about $250 million from the first quarter of 2009, but trailed off by about $25 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. And third on expenses, we continue to invest for long-term revenue growth, particularly in building distribution for sales and technology for customer service.", "Couple of things on the individual business lines I would like to point out. As I mentioned before, each of our main business lines, community banking, wholesale banking, wealth and brokerage services were profitable in the quarter. Quickly on community banking, as you can see on slide 13, we had record sales, record cross-sell, very strong deposit growth. The mortgage servicing portfolio reached $1.8 trillion, up 2%. At the end of the quarter, the mortgage application pipeline was up about 4% from the prior quarter. And wholesale banking, slide 14, wholesale banking has been very consistent in producing solid revenue growth. In the first quarter in this year, revenue growth once again was up 9% from a year ago, despite the decline in commercial loan demand over the last year. And in the Asset Management Group, we have now reached $465 billion in assets under management.", "Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement services are on slide 15, we are getting very solid growth in this business. Revenue was up 16% from the first quarter of \u201909. And we have now reached $1.1 trillion in retail brokerage client assets, that\u2019s up 22% year-over-year. Let me now turn to credit. Slide 16 provides some detail on the impact of adopting FAS 167 on our credit portfolios. It\u2019s important to understand this detail in order to understand the underlying trends in credit quality at the company. While FAS 167 had only a 1 basis point impact on Tier 1 common, it add $909 million to non-accruals in the quarter and $123 million to charge-offs in the quarter.", "In addition to the charge-offs from FAS 166, 167, charge-offs in the first quarter included $145 million related to newly issued regulatory charge-off guidance applicable to collateral-dependent residential real estate loan modifications that relates to high LTV, low FICO, interest-only consumer real estate that have already been reserved for. So, with that as perspective, slide 17. As John indicated before, we believe the credit at Wells Fargo has indeed turned the corner. Provision expense appears to have peaked in the third quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 provision expense of $5.3 billion was down almost $800 million from the peak and about $600 million from the fourth quarter of 2009.", "As indicated in the slide, the $5.3 billion provision expense in the quarter included the $145 million for collateral-dependent loans and the $123 million for FAS 167. So, provision expense for other charge-offs was $5.06 billion, down from $5.41 billion in the fourth quarter on an apples-to-apples basis. Two quarters ago, as you can see on slide 18, we were one of the first and few banks to project a peaking in credit costs and we now believe charge-offs already peaked in the fourth quarter earlier than we previously thought. Commercial and commercial real estate losses actually declined $356 million in the quarter, declining in all major commercial categories, C&I lending, commercial real estate, and lease financing. Losses in our $132 billion commercial real estate portfolio declined in the first quarter by $59 million, reducing the net charge-off rate to about 2%. This portfolio is secured by a well-diversified mix of property types across wholesale banking, community banking, and wealth brokerage and retirement services.", "The performance of the CRE portfolio has benefited from some price stability, increased liquidity, and the actions we have taken over the past year focused on restructuring disposition and workout strategies. Slide 18 also indicates where we have charge-offs in the consumer portfolios, FAS 167 and modified [ph] loans. Apart from those two items, all other consumer charge-offs were essentially flat in the quarter with all other revolving credit and installment charge-offs actually down largely due to improved auto finance markets.", "One of the reasons we are confident credit has turned is the stabilization and improvement we are experiencing in early-staged delinquencies across the major consumer portfolios as you can see on chart 19. Card and auto delinquencies stabilized in the middle of last year and showed noticeable improvement in the most recent quarter. Secured real estate is taking a little longer, but began to show improvement in delinquencies in the first quarter of 2010. Our $125 billion non-PCI home equity portfolio also demonstrated some positive credit trends in the first quarter. The delinquency rate on this portfolio, two or more payments past due, decreased in the first quarter to 3.4%, down from 3.58% in the fourth [ph]. Delinquencies declined in both the liquidating and the core portfolios and for loans in both California and Florida.", "Delinquency rates for loans in the core portfolio with a combined LTV above 100% or only 5.27%, as the vast majority of customers with negative equity continued to make their payments. On March 17th, we announced that we signed the agreement for the second lien modification program and we expect to begin offering the second lien program to customers who have both in Wells Fargo first and second lien customers within the next couple of weeks, and we will offer the program for other customers later in the second quarter.", "Our Pick-a-Pay portfolio which is highlighted on slide 20, roll rates on both the impaired and unimpaired Pick-a-Pay portfolio continued to trend better. The size of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio continued to decline in the quarter, with $82.9 billion outstanding at quarter end, down over $10 billion from a year ago. This portfolio continued to perform better than expected at the time of the merger, driven by 57,000 completed modifications, experiencing lower-than-industry re-default rates and stabilization in home prices in certain markets will get significant outstandings.", "This quarter, the current LTVs actually declined in both the impaired and non-impaired Pick-a-Pay portfolios. Early-staged delinquency trends improved to 30 days past due loans stabilizing are showing early indications of improvement in both the PCI and non-impaired portfolios. We also saw a continued improvement in first-time delinquencies, which are the percentage of new 30 plus day delinquent loans that are delinquent for the first time in the life of the loan. In the non-impaired portfolio, the percentage of first-time delinquency has dropped for four consecutive quarters, and in the PCI portfolio, the ratio of first-time delinquency was at levels not seen since early 2008. These improved trends led to our confidence in releasing $549 million of the remaining $14.5 billion non-accretable difference into accretable yield related to the improved life of loan loss estimates that we now see and this compares with only $27 million released in all of last year. This increase at accretable yield of course will be recognized through interest income over many years.", "Let me now turn to non-accrual loans on slide 21. Non-accrual loans as you can see were up in the quarter, $909 million of course as I said related to the FAS 167 announced, but we do not believe that the increase in non-accrual loans translates into increased future losses, since these non-accruals have either already been written down or their expected loss content is already been reserved for. Couple of important statistics on non-accrual loans. 37% of our total consumer non-accrual loans have already been written down and approximately two-thirds of consumer loans have either been written down or have current LTVs below 80%.", "On the commercial side, 29% of the commercial non-accrual loans have already been written down, 69% have been reserved for at life of loan projected loss content to the FAS routine [ph] allowance process and the remainder are accounted for with reduced future loss projections and reserves to the general allowance assessment. Over 45% of commercial and CRE non-accruals are currently paying interest as applied to principal. All of the increase in OREO in the quarter by definition represents assets that have been written down, and the bulk of the increase in OREO reflects GNMA guaranteed mortgage pools or PCI real estate that shifted into OREO from accruing PCI loans.", "The increase in non-accrual loans primarily came from consumer real estate and commercial real estate. Non-accruals in all of the other loan categories have stabilized or declined. Consumer real estate non-accruals remained elevated largely due to slower outflows, not increased quarterly inflows. Our reference to keep customers in their homes through loan modifications required customers to provide updated documentation and complete six-month trial repayment periods before the loan can be removed from non-accrual status. In addition for loans in the process for foreclosure, many states including California and Florida have an active legislation that significantly increase timeframes to complete the foreclosure process, which can be as long as 18 months, which means that loans remain in non-accrual status for longer periods, even though the loss is already been taken.", "Once the loan completes the foreclosure process, we have been able to sell the property in a very timely fashion. When consumer real estate loan is 120 days past due, we move it directly to non-accrual status and when the loan reaches 180 days past due, it\u2019s our policy to mark it down to net realizable value. Thereafter we revalue each loan in non-accrual status regularly and recognize additional charges if needed. Since home prices stabilize in many metropolitan areas, we do not anticipate significant additional write-downs unlike consumer real estate loans that are already in non-accrual loan status.", "On the commercial side, CRE non-accrual loan inflows actually declined 27% in the first quarter, but it is typically in everyone\u2019s economic interest including ours to write the loan down to continue to have the developer work the project for us rather than foreclose. The process of structuring and executing these solutions can take several quarters to complete, and throughout this process, these loans are closely monitored, collaterals are re-evaluated and if necessary loss content is recognized.", "It\u2019s worth noting I believe that compared with our large peers, our total loan portfolio is comprised of proportionately less unsecured credit. For example, only 3% of our total loans are credit cards and proportionately more real estate secured loans, both consumer and commercial. Now, what this means is that some of our large peers have higher reserve coverage, which makes sense because unsecured loans, credit card in particular have higher loss rates, and therefore have higher charge-offs and fewer non-accruals, since unsecured loans are charged off more quickly. By comparison, a portfolio with proportionately more real estate secured loans like Wells Fargo would be expected to have lower loss rates, lower charge-offs, but lagging non-accrual improvements due to the extended period that real estate secured loans need in order to have complete resolution or collateral supporting of the non-accruals.", "Page 22 goes over our PCI loan portfolio, which is clearly performing better than our original expectations. Since the final true-up write-down of the PCI loan portfolio, we have now realized $476 million of value for PCI loans paid in full, we have realized $207 million on loans sold, and we have re-classified $1.1 billion to accretable yield for improving cash flow. Remember that, it will be taken to income over a long period of time, and we have also provided $1 billion for loans that have deteriorated since the Wachovia acquisition was completed. When you add all of those things together, that gives you a net increase of $774 million in the value of the PCI portfolio.", "Slide 23 goes over our allowance. At March 31st, our allowance is $25.7 billion, up almost $4 billion from the close of the Wachovia merger. That\u2019s equal to five times a decline in quarterly charge-off and 3.3% of our total loans. In addition of course, we have a $19.9 billion in non-accretable difference for PCI loans.", "So, very quickly, in summary, we had $2.5 billion in earnings across a traditional and diverse business-serving consumers, more businesses and commercial customers. We believe credit has turned and our balance sheet has never been stronger and our financial capacity for growth never better.", "I would like to now open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Mcdonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hi good morning Howard.", "Howard Atkins", "Hi John.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hi John.", "John Stumpf", "Hi John.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "On the repurchase reserve, Howard, do you have any visibility on how far along we might be in this process, aren\u2019t we potentially turning the corner here, do we know?", "Howard Atkins", "You know, we think we are pretty far along. Most of the activity here relates to some of the older vintages which we think of now been clearing through. So, obviously, we take this one quarter at a time, but we did add pretty significant $400 million to the reserve in the quarter, and we think it\u2019s a robust reserve at this point.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And have you disclosed the amount of the reserve?", "Howard Atkins", "$1.3 billion at quarter end.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And then on the net interest income fund, Howard, could you discuss a couple of the, kind of, what influenced the margin decline quarter-to-quarter, and just looking ahead, what is your ability to grow net interest income or at least stop it from going down if loan demand does not come back.", "Howard Atkins", "So, ironically, the 4 basis points is largely attributable to the strong deposit growth that we have had in the quarter. We are as I mentioned, very, very liquid. We continue to get this very strong deposit growth and soft loan demand, and we are keeping our powder dry on the investment portfolio. So, what all that means is the deposit growth, which is good for revenue and good for earnings is really winding up being invested in short-term cash. So, that\u2019s really why the margin went down to 4 basis points. And we will take the deposit growth because that really is belief to all kinds of other good things in the company and we will just to have see where loan demand goes.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And in terms of securities, you are still cautious waiting for high yields to invest?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, this is a long-term proposition. We obviously evaluated quarter-to-quarter, but securities were down, you know, maturing, and we are keeping our powder dry. We obviously manage interest rate risk very carefully. We want to keep our rate risk as neutral as we can, but we still think that the right thing to do is invest for the long term.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Sure. And related to that on the MSR hedge, will you relatively fully hedge this quarter? I know you are biased towards becoming less hedged as rates rise, can you kind of discuss of how you think about that?", "John Stumpf", "We have been relatively fully hedged as you would expect as long as long-term rates have been coming down as they have for the last several years. We did shift the composition in the hedge somewhat in the quarter, which is not unusual, but we do want to take into account the possibility of extension risk in the hedges and if anything we may have tilted a little bit towards a slightly lower hedge, because we think again the odds of higher long-term rates are greater than the odds of lower long-term rates. So, naturally, in that kind of situation, we would be a little bit less hedged, but I don\u2019t want to make too much of that. We didn\u2019t significantly reduce the size of the hedge, we are just sort of tilting that way a little bit.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "It wasn\u2019t clear to me in the documents, maybe disclose it, did you have a reduction in the carrying income on the hedge this quarter and did you disclose the amount on that?", "Howard Atkins", "We didn\u2019t. The overall hedging result was down about $900 million in the quarter to bring it roughly in line with where hedging results were in the early part of last year, sort of more typical for this point in the cycle, largely due to a change in the composition of the hedge, and as I say, we tilted a little bit more from higher coupon mortgage forwards into lower note rates and the interest rate swops to get a little bit more balance in the hedge.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. My last question is on the PCI portfolio, the accretable yield balance went up to 15.8 billion, it looks like the drivers are both the modifications and then some change in your life of loan loss assumptions, is that right that both contributed?", "Howard Atkins", "That\u2019s correct. The more important of that would be the modification. So, we have been very successful modifying this portfolio, and as a result \u2013", "John Stumpf", "The cash flows are assisting.", "Howard Atkins", "Cash flows are improving.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And is there room, last quarter you mentioned that, if current trends continue, there is room to change the life of loan loss assumptions if those trends continue, is there room for that to change your hedge going forward?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, again, we are being very cautious and very diligent about that. And we did as I mentioned take in some this quarter, and there\u2019s more to come if this process continues and things improve, definitely some possibility there down the road.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And the 9-year life of loan loss assumption, the 9-year duration assumption on the Pick-a-Pay, is that starting from here or over the life, meaning that is more like five to six years left to go?", "Howard Atkins", "That\u2019s basically, it\u2019s roughly from here, but again that\u2019s an estimate. These portfolios have, you know, it\u2019s duration, it\u2019s not fixed maturities. So, that can change as the interest rates change up and down over the cycle.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "That\u2019s roughly the period over which you recognize that accretable yield?", "Howard Atkins", "Correct.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Thank you.", "Howard Atkins", "Again, you got to be \u2013 that\u2019s an estimate. So, just be careful, it\u2019s a rough number, right.", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And is it even over that life or does it fade as the balance of impaired loans goes down?", "John Stumpf", "It\u2019s rough John.", "Howard Atkins", "It\u2019s rough John, it\u2019s going to change, okay. I mean, the main point is it\u2019s going to \u2013 we are not taking all of this into income either way, and it will just be spread over a period of time as these loan balances mature over that time period.", "John Stumpf", "I think, John, the takeaway here is cash flows are improving. We are starting to move very cautiously, but moving non-accretable into accretable. More and more of these loans, we are moving out of the Pick-a-Pay category into fixed rates, if they don\u2019t have the negative opportunity and we feel good about where we are in that portfolio.", "Howard Atkins", "Okay, thanks guys.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi John, Howard.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I guess first a big picture question. What\u2019s your strategy on home equity? We are seeing some banks essentially exiting the business and anticipating a lot of runoff there. So, you have got about a $100 billion book I think in the core portfolio. Just one, what\u2019s the strategy and then any guess on where those balances bottom out?", "John Stumpf", "Well, we are in that business. We think it\u2019s an important product to offer as part of the product suite to help customers succeed financially. We are doing that business. Obviously, differently in some cases we had in the past, but frankly, now is some of the better time we do that business. And I think as a general statement, consumers will probably borrow less in the future compared to the past as they save more, but we are not exiting that business.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So, it\u2019s not going to go down like 50% or 75% like we might see in some other banks?", "John Stumpf", "As we sell more and deepen relationships with the customers, we do business with one in three Americans one way or another. So, I can\u2019t make that prediction, but we sure liked the performance of our advantages over the last few years.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then separately, a little more of a detailed question, as we think about the net interest margin, one thing that\u2019s dragging it down the industry and I think for you guys would be the high level of non-performing assets, and yours are up to I think about 30 billion, 31 billion or so. Do you guys have a rough estimate on what the drag is to the NIM from the NPAs on some of the interest reversals?", "Howard Atkins", "The NPAs themselves at this point given the fact that short-term interest rates are so low, it\u2019s really not a big, not a big impact. As I said before, the bigger impact is the cash that we have on the balance sheet that\u2019s been built up on the trend basis, but \u2013", "John Stumpf", "You could just do a math, our average loans equal about 5% give or take and you can do it \u2013", "Howard Atkins", "We are talking about bps, we are not talking about \u2013", "John Stumpf", "Actually the bigger cost, and I have to be honest about it is all the people we have debt against, all the modifications and the workout and so forth, that is not an insignificant number. And as we get through this cycle, of course, we will be very thoughtful about taking those numbers down and getting that team right-sized.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I guess on that note, do you have an estimate of what the environmental costs are?", "John Stumpf", "There are a lot.", "Howard Atkins", "As I said \u2013", "John Stumpf", "We have 17,400 people decked against just in them mortgage company. So, I mean, that\u2019s one area of doing modifications and there\u2019s lot of other folks around here doing commercial and other areas in loss mitigation, besides all the appraisal costs, legal costs and so forth.", "Howard Atkins", "I mean, just to give you some ideas, as I mentioned earlier, if you just add up all the foreclosed property expense and the people that we have got decked up against loan resolution, that cost alone is up about $250 million from a year ago, maybe running around $150 million to $170 million in the first quarter of this year, above the average from last year. So, that\u2019s going to stay high for a short period of time, but really does represent a pretty important opportunity down the road to unwind those costs in the future.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you very much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Yes, good morning. I wondered can you describe the second lien program a bit that you said. And you said it was first with Wells being about in the first and second position and do you forgive principal or just stretch it out and then how would you modify a mortgage where you are the second to somebody else\u2019s first? Hello?", "Howard Atkins", "Yes, we do this a lot of different ways. We have been modifying seconds frankly for a long period of time. So, the program here is really not very different from the way we have been doing it all along. We do modify in terms, sometimes in terms of principal. So, we reuse all of that just to make this happen.", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer", "And is there any way you can sketch out what if any financial impact that has and would we see it in on the charge-off line, would we see it in the yield line, or is this something that we are going to notice at all in the financials in any meaningful way?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, I think at the end of the day, we don\u2019t think these programs are going to have a meaningful difference in net losses. It\u2019s just we are using many of these tools already in the toolbox and so whether it be 2MP or whatever the case is, we are working with these customers and in most cases, where we do use a principal forgiveness, customer has to have at least enough income to pay the new payment and he has to look at a house or a housing situation where there is a highly unlikely valuable comeback in any reasonable period of time. But this is just one of a number of tools that we use as we work with these customers.", "Howard Atkins", "And I would say that the 2MP program itself again is very consistent with the way we have always been modifying seconds. And therefore you could conclude that the estimates of what that means financially, we have already in effect accounted this in our reserve position.", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then secondly on the Wachovia synergies, you have said that you have realized 70% and obviously, there has been many quarters now since the merger happened and there is organic growth in expenses and cutting, and so I had lost a bit of track of it in the numbers, but is there a reasonable way to think about this that, that if you originally said you would have $5 billion in savings, and you still expect to get 30% of that, that would be about $1.5 billion. And so, if we look at the rate of expense growth from 2010 to 2011, if we are going to say there was a $40 billion base, and you would have 5%, 6%, 7% growth off of that, and we subtract out $1.5 billion, is that the right way to think about it?", "Howard Atkins", "Yes, it\u2019s a good approximation, yes.", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "And we have been reinvesting right in distribution, and people, and that\u2019s \u2013 we always want to do that, so we can serve our customers completely and develop those relationships.", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks, good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning Betsy.", "Howard Atkins", "Good morning.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Two questions. One, can you tell us how much cash interest on non-accruals you received this quarter?", "Howard Atkins", "I don\u2019t think we have that out. We will get back to you on that, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then secondly, the question I always get on the second liens is to other delinquencies so low when there is \u2013 obviously a relatively high portion is under water. Maybe to address that question, could you just give us a sense of what you see as the drivers for the delinquencies in your home equity book and the drivers for the charge-offs, because it\u2019s clearly not LTV, right?", "John Stumpf", "As I think I had mentioned in the past, I actually grew up as a collector, and the things that caused delinquency and frankly loss, the same things that were there 35 years ago when I started and the biggest issue there is unemployment. If people have a job, they want to intend to pay their bills. So, what causes loans to go into a delinquency situation typically is, you know, if you want the big four, it\u2019s death, divorce, unscheduled medical payment, and a lack of a job. And lack of a job is the big one. So, we have many, many of our customers in the home equity area who are either high laundering value over 100% combined on the value who are paying as agreed never missed a payment. The factors in many cases, there\u2019s little correlation between LTV and delinquency, but there is a big correlation between high LTV and loss, because when they don\u2019t have any income and they are upside down, there is going to be a loss there.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So, then you have got the handful of experience \u2013", "John Stumpf", "Betsy, so I look at jobs more than, than I look at LTVs with respect to the performance of the home equity portfolio.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Now, that\u2019s helpful. I mean, because the other question is on the seconds, was this really a secured product or is the documentation such that secured products does that matter for how you are reserving for it?", "John Stumpf", "Well, again, it\u2019s secured to the extent that there is collateral there, right. But it is also people are \u2013 there has been times in my life I have been upside down on a mortgage and if you give people a job, they want to stay in their home, they pay.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And then on the HAMP programs where there has the new program that came out a few weeks ago that hasn\u2019t yet started, but where on the first liens, you would be required to potentially do principal forgiveness, assuming you have done already. Is that going to change how you are thinking about recognizing loss content in the portfolios that you have got? I know, Howard you indicated that you already reserved for a large part of what you are seeing in the home equity portfolio, but I am wondering if the principal forgiveness in the HAMP ones is going to impact out at all?", "John Stumpf", "I don\u2019t, I think through the first quarter, we have forgiven 2.8 billion on programs outside of HAMP, and we think that was the right thing to do, and it\u2019s just one of the tools we use and it doesn\u2019t work for every customer. But no, that won\u2019t have a significant impact on how we look at reserves or how we look at that portfolio.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Howard Atkins", "And again, Betsy, just keep in mind that while HAMP is new and 2MP is new, we have been modifying these portfolios for the last five quarters. So, that\u2019s not new. So, we are going to imply all of these methods for a longer period of time.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel Nicolaus.", "", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my call.", "Howard Atkins", "Hi Chris.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Howard, I don\u2019t want to beat the horse on liquidity, but looking at your FED fund sold position and at $54 billion, as to more than some of the banks I cover, is there any, in terms of assets, is there any point of the curve I should be paying more attention to that would suggest when you start reinvesting some of that your massive excess liquidity?", "Howard Atkins", "Yes, deployment rates are higher.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Is it a 5-year, is it a 7-year, is it 2-year, is it that FED is moving interest rates on a short end?", "Howard Atkins", "Look, I think the notion of buying really long-term assets before the FED is actually even started tightening is just something that we would need to think really carefully about. So, this is not new, Chris. We have always managed the portfolio this way as you know. We keep our investment portfolio. It self pretty liquidates, it\u2019s typically mortgage-backed securities, and \u2013", "John Stumpf", "Plain vanilla.", "Howard Atkins", "Plain vanilla, it\u2019s designed to frankly manage to keep the balance sheet risk, interest rate risk neutral against a growing base of long duration deposits that we have on the other side of the balance sheet. And it just makes sense to us to take our time here and do this right as we always have.", "John Stumpf", "And frankly, Chris, we have been also sellers. As you recall, when we think things are at the right time, we have moved assets off the balance sheet, because we are afraid of things going up. So, I think we have shown discipline overtime, both in the buy and sell side.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "No, that\u2019s fair. I think you show in the discipline. I am just looking out a huge amount of excess liquidity that you are kind of under earning on that until rates go up I guess. Howard, staying with \u2013?", "Howard Atkins", "And in the meantime, Chris, as you know, we have also been paying down debt on the other side of the balance sheet. We have very, very flexible debt issuance position right now, but we have relative to large peers about half as much debt maturing in the next couple of years the other big companies. So, we actually think of the balance sheet as being a very flexible position and when \u2013 we are going to manage it as neutrally as we can.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Kind of follow-up question, when I look at your tax rate this quarter, you kind of started or kind of bucked the trend in that, many of my banks are showing lower tax rates. If you guys had significantly increased, a steep increase in tax rate, if I calculate it correctly, your tax equivalent rate was 37%, is that a good run rate going forward or is there \u2013 I mean, I saw in the release it was impacted a little bit by a certain item, but still it seems like a pretty high tax rate going forward?", "Howard Atkins", "We calculate it at around 35%, Chris.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.", "Howard Atkins", "And it did include the 50-somewhat million dollar item that we indicated. You know, likely that it will be slightly down over the balance of the year. And again, that gets impacted in our case, but as you know, about the mix between taxable income and tax-exempt income in the overall net income before tax. So, that\u2019s one of the reason it goes up and down, but I think you should expect it to be down a little bit over 2010.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "All right. And then just one final thing, can you refresh, given the stories in the news about CDOs, can you refresh my memory on what your exposure is from the Wachovia side to the CDO products and what you have written down to?", "John Stumpf", "On the Wells side, we are never in that business, and Wachovia was mostly in commercial real estate, but exited that business toward the end of 2007, which was a year before the merger.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Have you disclosed what the par is and what they have been written down to?", "Howard Atkins", "We haven\u2019t, but I think generally you could assume that we have written it down to fair value at kind of the worst point in the cycle.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Anything else you can add to that or no?", "Howard Atkins", "No.", "Chris Mutascio \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Good morning guys.", "John Stumpf", "Hi Nancy.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Two questions, Pick-a-Pay, can you tell us what the life on that portfolio is at this point? In other words, at what point do we start to sort of ignoring the Pick-a-Pay portfolio from a size perspective? I would like to ignore it now, but I can\u2019t.", "Howard Atkins", "So, it\u2019s roughly $89 billion portfolio that\u2019s dropping \u2013", "John Stumpf", "$82 billion.", "Howard Atkins", "Sorry, $82 billion, that\u2019s declining couple of billion dollars a quarter. So, we are down $10 billion year-over-year. So, do the math, as we said before, it\u2019s around 9 years or so left of duration perspective.", "John Stumpf", "And we are also moving the portfolio away from the Pick-a-Pay option to a fixed or a non (inaudible) kind of product. So, Nancy, about two-thirds of our PCI portfolio in Pick-a-Pay is in California and over 50% of the total portfolio is here, which has been good news for us, because that kind of house in the average loan, there is 220,000 or so is more of a starter home, and that housing has reached a bottom and probably bounced off the bottom here. So, of all the portfolios I worry a lot about, this is not one of them.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "My second question would just be this. I mean, as rates rise and inevitably they will hopefully, do you expect any changes in deposit behavior and speaking of deposits, do you expect that you are going to have to share more of the rise with consumers as they have become more knowledgeable that rates are coming off the floor, if you could just give us your thoughts about any inflection point in rates and how it impacts deposits?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, what happens, Nancy, is that typically on the upside, when rates start to turn around, we actually at least it works historically, historically we actually see a benefit because some of the deposits we have are fixed rate and some of the assets re-priced earlier, and secondly, this company versus almost any other of our competitors, so many of our deposits are either interest-free or near-free that they don\u2019t re-price and we are paying the price today, because you can\u2019t bring them any lower than zero in their costs. And when rates turn around, they become more valuable of course. So, who knows what happens as time goes on, but we want to be competitive, we want to give our deposit rates a fair deal, and we are thoughtful on the way up, but I don\u2019t view that as a big risk.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks, good morning everyone.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning Joe.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "You mentioned commercial real estate inflows were down 27% sequentially but commercial real estate non-accrual loans were up 20%, I just wondered if you could reconcile that, is it just the lag in migration or the fact that you let developers continue to work the projects, and where in the commercial real estate portfolio are you seeing the most improvements?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, the developers are working the projects, Joe. That\u2019s exactly the issue. We are not experts in this, and we will \u2013 the ultimate resolution that maximizes values where we want to be, so many cases, we will put something on accrual. We will still be quacking interest, like Howard said, almost half of our commercial real estate loans that are non-accrual are still paying the interests, but we want to be conservative and take that route and get those things worked out.", "Howard Atkins", "And that really is the point, Joe. So, the non-accruals, the inflows are going down a lot, which is good news for the future. And it\u2019s just been everybody\u2019s interest to have the developer continue to work the project and keep whatever cash flow is going rather than tossing into foreclosed and have us trying to deal over with it. So, that\u2019s just economically better for everybody.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "That makes sense. So, does that 27% decline include construction or is it just term CRE?", "Howard Atkins", "That\u2019s both CRE.", "John Stumpf", "It\u2019s everything.", "Howard Atkins", "Inflows are down 27%.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then secondly, would you please update us on your expectations for the impact of Reg E and the change in overdraft fees and talk about any efforts you are working on to mitigate that?", "John Stumpf", "It hasn\u2019t changed from what we previously announced, and we are going to be coming out shortly with the way that we are going to work with customers and provide them choice as part of the changes that will affect new customers, July 1st, and I think the existing customers in August 16th.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And can you remind us how much of your revenues currently come from overdraft fees?", "John Stumpf", "I think we have mentioned that it\u2019s a $500 million impact for this year.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. All right. Fair enough, thanks so much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks. I was intrigued by the comment in the press release about the rate of NPA increased kind of lagging charge-offs. I mean, I think that\u2019s very different than kind of prior cycles, is that a function of the charges you have taken on NPAs, the marks on the credit impaired loans, some combination, I mean, because that\u2019s not \u2013 I mean, normally it\u2019s the other way around, normally charge-offs kind of keep going up well after NPA\u2019s crest.", "Howard Atkins", "Again, a lot of that phenomenon in part is due to the nature of the portfolio being a secured portfolio. So, the sequencing is we charge it down, write it down, but it may hang in non-accrual for a period of time as either the commercial loan gets worked for or the consumer real estate gets modified or something else happens to the loans. So, it\u2019s just the nature of the portfolio, Moshe.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And is it, but I guess, is it a different way of working it out, it\u2019s with the existing either homeowner or developer, somewhat longer, is that the upshot?", "Howard Atkins", "Well, It think the modification process and the fact that so many of these loans are now out there is taking perhaps a little bit longer than we normally take in prior cycles, but fundamentally, it\u2019s the nature of the portfolio again being very different than unsecured portfolio. We have just much higher losses, but you are getting rid of the (inaudible).", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "That\u2019s great. Great, thanks so much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.

My name is Celeste and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). ", "I would now like to turn today\u2019s call over to Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Rowe. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Jim Rowe", "", "Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and CFO Howard Atkins will review Second Quarter 2010 Results and answer your questions. ", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our Second Quarter Earnings Release and our Quarterly Supplement are available on our website. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements in today\u2019s call, and that those forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to different materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8K and the Earnings Release and Quarterly Supplements are included as exhibits. ", "In addition, some of the discussion today about the company\u2019s performance will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can be found in our SEC filings and in the Earnings Release and Quarter Supplements available on our website at wellsfargo.com. ", "I will know turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf", "John Stumpf", "", "Thank, Jim. And thanks everyone who has joined us on this call. We appreciate your interest in Well Fargo. ", "I\u2019ll turn this call over to our CFO, Howard Atkins shortly for a more in-depth look at our quarter results. But first, I\u2019d like to comment briefly on the strength of our franchise, the status of our Wachovia merger integration and the current regulatory environment. ", "As to our financial performance, our Second Quarter results again reflected the underlying strength of our company with all three business segments contributing to our profitability. Our next income was up about 20% from last quarter, and represents just the fourth time in our history that we\u2019ve had quarterly net income over $3 billion. ", "More importantly, we\u2019re winning new business everyday, seeing growth in certain loan portfolios and more instances where conversations are turning into new relationships and new commitments. ", "It is early yet to call these sustainable trends, but it is real progress and it is in the right direction. ", "While the uneven economic recovery continues to create some headwinds to loan and revenue growth, we continue to see the core power of our diversified business model at work. For example, we think it is meaningful that Q2 revenue held up well versus last year despite a year-over-year decline in mortgage banking revenue of about $1 billion, along with the steady decline in earning assets over the year; a real testament to our overall business model\u2019s resilience. ", "Continuing to focus intensely on helping our customer succeed financially has allowed us to perform well through various economic cycles; a hallmark of our business. ", "In addition, we\u2019re now about half way through our three-year Wachovia Merger Integration Plan. We successfully integrated the California Wachovia stores in April, and this weekend we\u2019ll integrate Texas, our largest overlapping market, and Kansas, which will complete the integration of all of our overlapping markets.", "During the quarter, we also completed one of the industry\u2019s largest trust conversions; $150 billion in trust assets representing about 81,000 accounts. ", "In addition, we completed a conversion in our unsecured loan portfolios, credit card rewards program, and mutual fund business. And we\u2019ve now done a lot of the heavy lifting to prepare for the integration of our East Coast markets, which begins in September with Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, followed in the Fourth Quarter with Georgia. ", "Our entire team is working exceptionally well together and culturally and financially, this merger is exceeding my expectations. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the opportunities ahead. ", "Now, there\u2019s no question that our industry is experiencing some uncertainty regarding the impact of regulatory reform. So let me spend a few minutes talking about the changing landscape based on what we know today. ", "First of all, Wells Fargo has always been focused on doing the right thing for our customers, and adhering to a philosophy of transparency with all of our stakeholders. Those are core to what we do. ", "While portions of the newly-signed legislation are consistent with that operating philosophy, which is positive, we remain concerned that some aspects may have unintended negative effect for America\u2019s financial system, for consumers, and for businesses. ", "Right now, we are proceeding with our efforts to gain a better understanding of all the components, and we will work internally with our regulators on implementation plans as the rule-making process evolves. ", "At this stage, it is too soon to definitively estimate the financial impact given the varying implementation timelines for different components of the bill, the need for some additional clarifications since the actual rule writing is still on the horizon and the size of potential financial offset. ", "Nevertheless, we believe the impact on Wells Fargo overall will be lower than the impact of our large-bank peers; particularly in areas such as proprietary trading, derivatives, and private equity. ", "There will be areas where we will be affected, like debit interchange. There is simply insufficient information at this point for us to make a determination as to the net economic outcome. ", "Any estimates will be premature in our view. It is just too soon. ", "With that being said, Wells Fargo joins others in our industry in wholly dedicating our talents and resources to the biggest priority we share with the American public; the return to a vibrant US economy. ", "To that end, Wells Fargo continues to supply significant credit to the US economy including consumers, small-and-medium sized business, and large corporate clients; about $990 billon over the last 18 months. We\u2019ve also helped more than 1 \u00bd million people keep their homes since January 2009. ", "We believe Wells Fargo has show that it\u2019s business model remains successful throughout these tough economic times. And we position our franchise well for better economic times ahead. We\u2019ve grown our customer base by providing a full spectrum of products and services to meet their needs throughout this period. We have an unmatched distribution platform nationwide. We\u2019ve maintained our increased market share across many of our business, and our leadership team is encouraged by signs of continued improvement in the credit landscape. ", "In my view, Wells Fargo has a banking franchise second to none in this country and we believe we are right where we need to be to continue to meet customer\u2019s financial needs while growing our business profitably. ", "Now, let me turn this over to Howard. ", "Howard Atkins", "", "Thank, John. My remarks this morning will follow the slide presentation included in the Quarterly Supplement available on the Wells Fargo Investor Relations Website. ", "Page 3 of the presentation gives you a very broad overview of the quarter and the topics I\u2019d like to cover today. ", "I\u2019ll start with my remarks with some detail about earnings of $3.1 billion, very strong of course. I\u2019ll conclude my remarks with some detail about our balance sheet and how that positions us for even more growth going forward. In between, I\u2019d like to leave you with three important takeaways about our quarter. ", "First, what you saw in the quarter was the Wells Fargo business model at work. With $21.4 billion in revenue, the Wells Fargo growth machine continued to fuel revenue and market share gains across many of our business in the quarter.", "Second, the combination with Wachovia is producing better-than-expected results and in particular, incremental revenue. ", "And third, credit quality clearly improved significantly in the second quarter, even earlier and more significantly than we originally projected. ", "Slide 4 goes through our earnings for you. Wells Fargo earned $3.1 billion in the quarter, producing record net income applicable to common of $2.9 billion, up 21% from the first quarter. ", "Since our merger with Wachovia, we have earned $18 billion, reflecting the strength of our franchise and the benefits of the merger. ", "Earnings last year, of course, were affected by higher credit costs, as well as strong mortgage hedging results. Earnings so far in 2010 reflect lower mortgage hedging results as the yield curve is moderated, but businesses as diverse as commercial banking, investment banking, asset-based lending, auto dealer services, debit card global remittance, mortgage servicing, and many, many others have had strong top-line and/or bottom-line results so far this year.", "In organization with as many business activities as ours, there are always pluses and minuses in every quarter. And while in my view the results are the results, I\u2019ll quickly mention a few of the more significant items in the second quarter.", "First, a $500 million release of loan-loss reserves reflecting improved loan portfolio performance. Second, a commercial loan resolution in the PCI portfolio increased $324 million from the first quarter. This is a reflection of our success in selling or resolving commercial PCI loans at real-life values above the marks we took when we closed the Wachovia merger. And we believe there may be additional recover potential in this portfolio going forward. ", "Operating losses in the quarter were $627 million, up $419 million from the first quarter, primarily due to additional litigation accruals. Merger expenses in the quarter were $498 million, up from $380 in the first quarter. And we had $137 million of severance costs for the previously-announced Wells Fargo Financial Restructuring. ", "Now, the pluses and minuses of these particular items for the quarter had a negligible impact on the bottom line results. ", "Slide 5 indicates our various operating margins and financial returns, which continued to be among the best in the industry with 4.38% net interest margin, 1% ROA, and a 14.6% return on tangible common. ", "At our investor conference in May, my business colleagues and I explained the importance of return on assets, the operating metric. As shown on Slide 6, we continued to generate the highest ROA among our large peers in the second quarter, as we have for many, many years. ", "Our higher ROA was driven by a couple of factors. First, the high proportion of checking and savings accounts and our deposit mix; in the second quarter, low-cost checking and savings accounts combined rose to 88% of total deposits. ", "Second, we have a lower credit cost rate in our loan portfolio, a reflection of our discipline underwriting culture, proactive loan surveillance and concentration, and lower loss-rate real estate secured loans.", "Our consolidated loss rate of 2.3% compares with an average of 3.9% for the other three large peers, although keep in mind this comparison is impacted by the respective PCI portfolios at each bank. ", "And third, we have a high proportion of total revenue coming from fee income, which tends to be less asset incentive. Our revenue per dollar of assets was 7% in the second quarter compared with an average of less than 5% for the other three peers. This is largely a function of our success in cross selling non-credit products in addition to the credit products we\u2019ve brought our customers. ", "Slide 7 shows that all business segments contributed to earnings in the second quarter with particularly strong results coming from community banking, which was up 21% and wholesale banking, which was up 18% from the first quarter. ", "Wealth Brokerage and Retirement Services earned $270 million, down about 4%. Within our three reporting segments, we operate more than 80 businesses. Across all of these business in total, consolidated revenue was flat late quarter and down about 4% year over year with declines in MSR hedging revenue, offset by revenue growth in our other 80-plus businesses, particularly those business where revenue is driven by sales including double-digit linked quarter revenue growth on greater customer volume in commercial and corporate banking, commercial real estate brokerage, asset-based lending, international, auto dealer services, merchant services and debit cards. ", "Starting on Slide 8, I\u2019ll quickly go over the results by each of these business segments. Wholesale Banking accounted for about 45% of the consolidated earnings in the quarter, and has had consistent revenue growth for many years, including the last six quarters since the merger. ", "Revenues reached $5.7 billion in this segment in the second quarter, up 8% from a year ago, and up 25% late-quarter annualized. ", "The Wholesale Business is very diverse with revenue growth in the second quarter coming from commercial, corporate, Eastdil Secured, our commercial real estate brokerage business, Well Fargo Capital Finance, our asset-based lending business, international and loan resolutions more than offsetting lower trading revenue in the quarter. ", "This business has been reducing non-strategic high-risk loans and securities positions since the merger, cumulatively earning in excess of our initial write downs during this period. ", "The Business Segment has been consistently growing deposits, which are up 18% year over year, and has recently seen signs of loan growth with loans to commercial customers, global financial institution customers and asset-based lending up in the second quarter. ", "Net Income in this segment was up 32% from a year ago on higher revenue and lower charge offs. Credit losses remain relatively low and declined 10% in the second quarter. ", "Slide 9, our Community Banking Business proves credit, mortgage, deposits and payment services to more than 20 million retail bank households and over 2 \u00bd million small businesses and business banking households with more banking stores to serve communities across the United States than any other bank. ", "Earlier this month we announced that we will be integrating the separate store distribution channel for consumer finance into the regional banking channel to better provide product coverage for consumer finance customers and branch consolidation savings in the process. This resulted in a $137 million restructuring charge in the second quarter for severance. ", "Our Community Banking business earned $1.8 billion in the second quarter, up 21% from the first quarter. This business segment has been profitable throughout the credit crisis and earned nearly a 1% ROA in the second quarter despite elevated credit costs and the impact of merger integration expenses for Wachovia. ", "The result in this segment essentially reflect the sales machine that is inherent in our regional banking distribution. Legacy Wells Fargo Core Product Solutions of $7.3 million were up 15% from a year ago, and Store-Based Small Business Solutions were up 31%. ", "Cross sale for Legacy Wells Fargo reached a record 6.06 products per household of Wells Fargo products, up from 5.84 percent a year ago, and reached 4.88 Wachovia products per household, up from 4.55 a year ago. ", "Total Consumer Loans were down, but certain portfolios increased late quarter, including Core Auto Loans, which are up 4% and Private Student Lending, which was up 1%. Mortgage applications rose 14% in the quarter and the unclosed mortgage application pipeline was $68 billion at the end of the quarter, up 15% from the first quarter. ", "New Small Business Loan commitments rose 30% from the first quarter. ", "While there are too many imponderables on the Reg Reform Bill, here\u2019s how we are thinking about Reg E and the Card Act. ", "First, Reg E and other overdraft changes, we estimate at $225 million after-tax impact in the third quarter and about $275 million in the fourth quarter, not including any offsets. Since Reg E changes did not begin until early July for new customers, and will not begin for current customers until mid-August, the third quarter will have limited revenue benefit, potential to offset and customer opt in, we expect revenue benefits and potential offsets to increase going forward. Q4 will potentially benefit form an increasing opt-in rate. ", "Because of the potential offsets and changes in customer opt-in rate, it is like that run-rate costs will diminish over time from the numbers that I just quoted you for the third and the fourth quarter. ", "The impact from the card act will be relatively small, approximately $30 million after tax in the third quarter, much smaller than up here given our significantly smaller credit card portfolio. ", "Slide 10, one of the keys to the consistent sales growth in the Regional Banking Group has been our ability to attract and retain consumer checking accounts across the country. Combined Legacy Wells Fargo and Wachovia consumer checking accounts were up a net 7.4% from a year ago. California continued to be our fastest growing state in the West of 9%, and we continued to see checking account growth accelerate in the East with New Jersey up 10% in the second quarter, double the growth rate from late last year. ", "The Wealth Broker Retirement Business has had solid revenue results over the past six quarters, even though the markets have been very volital. Second quarter revenue included strong asset-based fee growth and steady brokerage transaction revenue. ", "Retail Brokerage Clients assets were up 6% year over year, while core deposits grew 7%. Institutional Retirement Plan Assets rose 10% on the market improvement and new customer growth. ", "Net Income and Wealth Brokerage Retirement was up 5% percent from the Second Quarter 2009 with growth and managed account fees driven by a 22% increase in Managed Account Assets, and 8% growth in Investment Management and trust revenue year over year. ", "Slide 12 covers lending at Wells Fargo, and I\u2019d like to spend some time on this slide. ", "On this slide, we\u2019ve split quarterly loans outstanding into the so-called Liquidating or Non-Strategic Portfolios. And the All Other Portfolios, which are portfolios where we plan to continue to originate loans. ", "The Non-Strategic Portfolio is comprised of about $125 billion in loan portfolios where we exited or no longer write new business, including Pick-A-Pay, Indirect Home Equity, Legacy Wells Fargo Financial, Indirect Auto, Wells Fargo Financial Debt Consolidation and Commercial and CRE PCI loans. ", "Please see the appendix for more details on the composition and the managed runoff of these loans. ", "Apart from these Non-Strategic loans, we had $620 billion in loans in the continuing portfolios. In the year prior to the second quarter, all other loans declined $10-to-$20 billion roughly per quarter. But in the second quarter, all of the loans were down only $5 billion, or less than 1%. About $3 billion of the $5 billion decline was due to mods and normal pay-off activity in the Non-Pick-A-Pay Mortgage Loan Portfolio. ", "Importantly, for the first time in the second quarter, we began to see some life in certain lending businesses, including linked-quarter growth in Wholesale Commercial, Wholesale Asset-Based Lending, Global Financial Institutions, Wealth Brokerage and Retirement, Auto Dealer Services, and Private Student Lending. We believe we are gaining share in those lending markets we continue to serve.", "As we have throughout the credit crisis, we continue to supply credit to the US economy in the second quarter. In the second quarter alone, we originated or committed to $150 billion of credit, up 17% from the first quarter. You can see the breakdown of that on Slide 13.", "The growth in Commercial and Commercial Real Estate originations and commitments was the largest quarterly increase since the merger. ", "Shifting to the other side of the balance sheet on Slide 14, we continue to grow checking and saving deposits which were up $59 billion or 10% from the year. Checking and savings deposits account for 88% of core deposits and at quarter end, our core deposits funded almost 100% of consolidated loans. ", "Besides, growth and high concentration of checking accounts in our deposit base represent important differentiators for Wells Fargo and important sources of cross sell and revenue growth. ", "We have significantly reduced high-cost CDs with $114 billion of Wachovia\u2019s higher-rate CDs maturing since the merger. Approximately 57% of maturing Wachovia CDs were retained in lower-rate CDs or checking and savings deposits. Now, most of Wachovia\u2019s higher-rate CDs have matured with only $4 billion scheduled to mature in the second half of 2010. ", "Slide 15, an important part of our revenue growth is the incremental revenue Wells Fargo was earning from the merger with Wachovia. There are many, many examples of this merger-enabled growth, if you will, a few of which are listed on Slide 15. Let me just mention a couple of these. ", "First, Wachovia cost, as I mentioned before, has now increased 7% from 4.55 just after the merger to 4.88 in the second quarter of 2010. So we\u2019re clearly getting good costs from the East. ", "Within Wholesale Banking, the product and expertise that we gain from Wachovia is driving increases within investment baking. The amount of investment banking revenue coming from our own commercial banking customers is up 45% since the merger. In part, this is more and more of Legacy Wells Fargo commercial and corporate customers are using Wells Fargo Securities to underwrite their bond and equity financings. ", "Within Government and Institutional Banking, crossover revenue is up 43% in the first half of 2010. In the Wealth and Retirement and Brokerage Business, client assets, deposits, managed accounts are all up significantly since the merger. And in our Retail Brokerage Group, we are significantly cross selling loans, which is one of the reasons our loan growth occurred in the second quarter. ", "We now shift to Slide 16. In terms of Non-Interest Expenses, we continue to invest in our businesses in the second quarter in ways that better serve our customers; opening 13 new banking stores in the quarter, converting over 1,400 ATMs to envelope-free, web-enabled ATMs, and increasing Regional Banking Platform banker, FTEs in the East, up 500 from year end to 1,009. ", "Most of the increase in Non-Interest Expense from the first quarter was due to three items. $419 million in additional operating losses; as I mentioned earlier, primarily due to additional litigation accruals. $137 million in severance costs related to the Wells Fargo Financial Restructuring, and $118 million in higher merger integration costs compared with the first quarter. ", "As John mentioned earlier, we continue to make great progress on integrating Wachovia and we will start to convert our stores in the East later this quarter after completing the overlapping markets this coming weekend. ", "In the first half of this year, we spent about $900 million on the Wachovia merger integration and we expect to spend approximately $1.2 billion in the second half of the year. We now except to spend approximately $1.4 billion for the integration in 2011, bringing the total Wachovia merger integration costs to approximately $5.7 billion. Now, this is an increase from our most recent estimate of approximately $5 billion and was driven by several factors. Including first, increased scope and complexity associated with certain merger projects such as the development of our international products and systems. Second, additional enhancements and upgrades, especially in our Treasury Management Products, and additional testing than was originally contemplated including building substantial test environments for our complex systems. ", "Now, on the savings side, we\u2019ve already achieved about 80% of the expected $5 billion in annual run-rate savings. As I mentioned on our investment, as part of our One Wells Fargo effort to bring the entire organization officially to each of our customers, we intend to simplify and streamline our company to make it easier for our customers to do business with us, and therefore, earn more of their business going forward. ", "Our objective is to improve customer service, reduce turnaround times, and improve time to market. But the expense savings associated with simplifying a streamlined company could be very significant. ", "The announcement we made earlier this month to close 638 Wells Fargo Financial Stores is but one example of the type of savings that would fall into this simplification and streamlining category. ", "Let me now shift to credit on Slide 17. As I indicated earlier, credit quality improved significantly in the second quarter. Net charge offs declined earlier and more significantly than projected and was down 16% late quarter and down $924 million from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2009. ", "Our early credit quality indicators continue to improve with non-accrual inflows down 18%, commercial criticized loans down 14% year to date, and early-stage delinquencies improving almost across the board. ", "Our PCI Portfolio continued to perform better than expected, resulting in the release of $1.9 billion from the non-accretable difference for the Pick-A-Pay portfolio, which will add to future income over the life of the loans. ", "At quarter end, we had $25 billion of allowance for credit losses, about 3.27 percent of total loans. And additionally, we had $16.2 billion in remaining non-accretable difference, about 26% of the PCI loan unpaid principle balance. ", "Because of improved portfolio performance, we released $500 million dollars in reserves in the second quarter with the potential for additional releases absence significant degeneration in the economy. ", "A couple of highlights about the credit quality in the quarter, starting on Slide 18, the 16% decline in charge offs from the first quarter was pretty much across the board. Commercial Real Estate loss was down about 10%. Consumer Loss was in total down 21%, including 23% decline in First Mortgage charge offs, 18% decline in Junior Lien Mortgage charge offs. Credit Card charge offs were down 10%, and Revolving Credit Card Loan charge offs were down 34%. ", "Slide 19 shows trends in consumer delinquencies. Early indicators continue to improve with 30 days past due improving in many consumer portfolios including Credit Card, Student Lending, Home Equity and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. ", "On Slide 20, it shows you the Pick-A-Pay portfolio where credit trends continue to improve in both the non-impaired and impaired Pick-A-Pay portfolios, with performance better than originally expected at the time of the merger. The roll rate of loans from current status to 30-plus days past due stabilized or improved in both the PCI and non-impaired Pick-A-Pay portfolios. And the percentage of first-time delinquent loans in the non-impaired portfolio is down for the fifth consecutive quarter. And in the PCI portfolio, first time delinquencies were levels not seen since prior to the merger. ", "We also had improvements in net charge offs in the non-impaired Pick-A-Pay portfolio, which were down $148 million, or 35% from the first quarter. ", "As shown on Slide 21, non-accrual inflow in the second quarter were down 18% with consumer inflows down 23% and commercial down 7%. In addition, outflows increased 12% from the first quarter. ", "Now, this combination of this dramatic slowdown on inflows and higher outflows resulted in a significant acceleration of non-accrual loan growth, which was up only 2% in the second quarter. ", "One of the reasons the level of outflow is not yet higher is that it is taking somewhat longer to resolve residential real estate loans, in part because the Federal and State regulations that have the affect of elongating the modification and foreclosure process. ", "Again, loans are written down when necessary and we get realizable value when we sell \u2013 but they seem to run on accrual for slightly longer periods of time. ", "On Slide 22, we consider the combination of $25 billion in the allowance and $16 billion remaining non-accretable difference to be low bust, especially now that charge offs are declining. As I mentioned earlier, during the second quarter we released $500 million of loan loss reserves reflecting improved performance in the loan portfolios both consumer and commercial. ", "The Purchas Credit Impaired portfolios have performed better than originally expected. And Slide 23 provides a lot of details on this. We already saw an improved performance in the Pick-A-Pay portfolio in the first quarter when we released $549 million of non accretable difference. In the second quarter with sustained positive performance in this portfolio, we released an additional $1.8 billion, reclassified to accretable yield. Now, the improvement in life-of-loan loss estimates is primarily attributable to our significant modification efforts as well as stabilization in the portfolio\u2019s delinquencies over the last several months. ", "I should mention that this $1.8 billion reclass of the non-accretable to accretable did not affect income in the second quarter, but will be realized over the remaining life of the portfolio, approximately eight years. ", "Now, with the remaining non-accretable difference of $16 billion, there may be additional potential for further releases from non-accretable to accretable if this portfolio continues to perform better than original expectations. ", "In the Commercial PCI portfolio we did, as I mentioned earlier, have a release of non-accretable difference from resolutions of loans, either through payment from customers or sales to third parties. Since the merger, we have written off $6.1 billion against the original PCI unpaid principle balance of $29.2 billion and the remaining commercial non-accretable difference represents about 15% of the remaining commercial PCI portfolio. ", "I\u2019ll conclude with a couple of remarks about our balance sheet on Slide 24. The strength of our business model continued to product high rates of internal capital generation as reflected in our significantly improved capital ratios. During the quarter we added $4 billion to tangible common equity through retained earnings and other internally generated sources of capital, producing the annualized increase in tangible common of 20%. ", "Q1 common ratio increased 44 basis points to 7.53%. In the second quarter we purchased 64% of the TARP warrants auctioned by the US Treasury, which reduced that Tier1 common by about 5 basis points. But which we expect to be accretive to earnings. ", "We expect to opportunistically repurchase more warrants in the open market from time to time at economic prices. ", "We have about $19 billion of outstanding Trust Preferred Securities and $7 billion of those will convert automatically to qualifying Tier 1 capital under their original terms. So under the new Financial Reform Act, only about $12 billion is expected to be disqualified over a three-year period beginning in 2013. The elimination has no impact on T1 common and given internally generated growth that\u2019s likely in capital over this time periods, we would expect the elimination of these Trust Prefers to have only a small impact on the T1 common. ", "Slide 25, in terms of our balance sheet, we believe our balance sheet is stronger than ever. Capital ratios are now substantially higher than they were before we doubled the size of the company with the Wachovia acquisition and our capital ratios have been growing rapidly through internal capital generation. T1 common, for example, is up a full 100 basis points year to date. Our loan loss reserves, the remaining non-accretable difference with the PCI portfolio are strong at a time where loses are coming down. The loan portfolio is now funded with core deposits and we have significant capacity to add mortgage-backed securities to build revenues and earnings even more at higher long-term yields.

", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer and Company ", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer ", "", "Yeah, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the geographic differences in the loan portfolios. And are you noticing any growth in any of the markets that are less stressed in housing than the other markets? And, in your judgement, how much of an impact is that, or has consumer behavior sort of been broadly changed in all geographies, in call different kinds of markets? ", "John Stumpf", "", "I want to take a shot at that, Chris. On the mortgage side, most of what we did in the second quarter on the first mortgage was refinances. And there is not a geographic bias to that, per se. But what we\u2019re seeing is, as we mentioned, and Howard talked about, it\u2019s more portfolio unique than geographic specific. So the growth we\u2019re seeing is, for example, in autos, we\u2019re seeing it there. We\u2019re seeing some of our small business; we\u2019re seeing some more activity there. Student lending and so forth, but I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s not a geographic bias that would stand out. ", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer ", "Okay. And switching to asset quality, any view on when you\u2019d expect total non-performers to peak? ", "John Stumpf", "I think we\u2019ve said in the past that we\u2019re getting close and it would not surprise me that \u2013 I mean, if you look at the acceleration of our growth, you can make your own assumptions about that. But you know, the issue there is, the inflows have been significantly reduced. The key is for us to get the outflows going faster and that is somewhat impeded by regulatory and other issues related to \u2013 especially in the residential side, State issues. ", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer ", "Okay. And then finally, how much do you expect the integration costs to carry on into 2011? ", "John Stumpf", "", "Well, we have said that, you know, we first stared out saying that we thought the cost was somewhere in the $8 billion range. We took that down to $5 billion. We think it\u2019s going to be something more than that; Howard shared those numbers. And we expect those costs to be used up or completed at the time of the merger completion, which is the end of 2011.", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer ", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Good morning. ", "John Stumpf", "", "Hey, Betsy. ", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Hi. A couple of questions; one on the NIM, and Howard, you mentioned some of the ins and outs up there, and I was intrigued by your comment that you indicated the significant capacity to add our MSB. Could you just talk through how you\u2019re thinking about shifts in the composition of earning assets, and the potential impact on NIM, if rates where to stay flat with where they are today?", "Howard Atkins", "", "Well, the key thing on NIM, as we\u2019ve said for a long time, is deposit. So the more we keep growing the deposits, that\u2019s going to be beneficial to the NIM. You know, the earning asset composition, in part is going to be a reflection of whether loan demand comes back more vigorously, which we would all like to see. We began to see signs of that in the second quarter in both commercial and to a lesser extent in consumer. So we hope that continues. ", "And you know, the mortgage, the MSB portfolio is going to be a function of whether yields are appropriate to add to the portfolio. But this way, we don\u2019t run the company around the NIM. The NIM is what it is. If we like MSB yields, and at some point in time we will, and we have huge capacity to add those, it might be negative to the NIM, but be positive to income. That would be the right thing to do. So the NIM is not the goal here. ", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Right. And so are you at the stage where you would be interested in shifting some of your liquidity into RMBS at this stage? ", "Howard Atkins", "", "It depends on the deposit growth, Betsy. The purpose of the MSB portfolio is really to match off against our long-duration liabilities, and the more deposit grow, we get a little longer on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. We could get to a point where just to manage the risk of that we want to add to the MSB portfolio, but absent that, we\u2019re very focused on long-term yields and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll stay focused on. ", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then on the accretable yield and the release of the accretable yield, could you just talk through what you would need to see to have more of that occur? I mean, obviously, a little bit of it was released this quarter. ", "Howard Atkins", "", "Well, you know, I think, Betsy, in that case it\u2019s all about performance. So we look at the cash flows and we look at how those portfolios are performing. And I think we shared a lot of detail at the investor conference and I think there was a lot of confidence in how we\u2019re managing that. And we will continue to make that analysis, and you know how that works. If we take the benefits over the remaining life, and if we miss on the other side, we have to put reserves up right away. So we want to be absolutely sure as we go through this process that we\u2019re sure on the performance of those portfolios. But the biggest amount left relates to the Pick-A-Pay and we probably have most confidence there about how that portfolio is performing. And the driver there, of course, Betsy, is the success we\u2019ve had in modifying these loans, which is really the fact of this that\u2019s driving the cash flow. So with the passage of time, and the success in modifying loans in that portfolio, that tends to increase our confidence around releasing more non-accretable. ", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then could you just speak to your outlook for house prices? There\u2019s been some question in the marketplace as to whether or not they\u2019ll stay where they are right now given the reduction in stimulus to the housing market. So I would think that would have an impact on how much you release there. ", "Howard Atkins", "", "Yeah. So if you think about the Pick-A-Pay, about 2/3s of the impaired portfolio happens to be in California. And most of those loans were your first-time homebuyer, or second-time homebuyer homes. And this state, California, and that price has seen more recovery than most places. So we\u2019ve been \u2013 it\u2019s been a benefit to us. And we\u2019re seeing other states where housing also is \u2013 on the low end has improved, bounced off the bottom. As I mentioned, a number of times, when we do take back properties and sell them, we\u2019re getting multiple bids, and most of them are cash bids. And while the first-time homebuyer credit was important, it\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s driving it. You\u2019ve got record-low interest rates these days, employment is pretty steady, and home price affordability has never been better. ", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you.

", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Stanford Bernstein", "Just a clarification on the NIM.

And are you still getting what you\u2019ve called the past, has carrying come on the hedge this quarter as well as kind of the change in the value of the hedge? ", "Howard Atkins", "", "Yeah, the mark on the hedge is a reflection of both the change in price as well as the carry. There is still carry income coming through. The total hedge result was down about $300 million from first to second quarter, largely as a result of a flattening of the curve. You know, the load rates came down to almost a full point in the quarter, and that was the main driver there. ", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Stanford Bernstein", "Okay. Wells Fargo has historically not released reserves even when other have. Could you give us a little color on in your models, what drove the release this quarter and what\u2019s driving your commentary that you could have continued reserve release in coming quarters? You know, what\u2019s different than in the past? ", "Howard Atkins", "", "That\u2019s very simple, charge offs dropped substantially, and the loss content, as we see it in these portfolios has dropped. And as a result, you have to release reserves to a certain extend when the loss content in the portfolio declines as it did. ", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Stanford Bernstein", "So it\u2019s just a revision of our 12- month, or 24-month outlook on losses?

And the loss content, as defined, as dropped pretty significantly, which you see in the first quarter of that loss-emergence period manifested in the second quarter results. ", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Stanford Bernstein", "Okay. And I guess declining balances also is a factor there as well? ", "John Stumpf", "", "Yeah, but not as much, John. It\u2019s more of what Howard just said. We take a look at this emergence period and \u2013 but this should be expected. I mean, when we were going through this last year on the other side of the curve, we knew this would be the case. And that\u2019s \u2013 ", "John Mcdonald \u2013 Stanford Bernstein", "Okay. The last question, and maybe it\u2019s for John. Just regarding the exit of the Wells Fargo Financial Business, John, you\u2019re in this business for over 100 years, you\u2019re long founded to be a profitable-valuable business, and you know, in the press release it cited your increase in Brink Branches in density as a driver of the decision to exit. Is there other things that cause your change in the view of the profitability and attractiveness of that business besides just sheer number of branches?

And when you add another 3,500 or 3,300 stores in the East, you know, we had the distribution. Secondly, some of the product, or one product, the debt consolidation product that we were doing, we really weren\u2019t doing much of it. So if you look at the rest of the things we were doing, we were doing those in other channels, we can do it more efficiently, provide a more consistent experience for the customer. So it all \u2013 it was a very obvious thing to do. We think about 100 years of experience, we\u2019ll still have that experience in a lot of our other distribution channels.

So you know, we are hopeful that we will get additional recoveries from that $2.9 billion, particularly given our success and given where the markets are now, you know, markets are liquid, these borrowers are able to refinance and finance out of these positions. We mark these positions as you know down very heavily at the close, but while we expect additional recoveries in this portfolio, it\u2019s an exhaustable resource. It does end at some point.

In fact, we\u2019ve been serving them for a number of years. This way we can serve them even better, more consistently, and we\u2019re taking a lot of the front-room folks, the sales folks from our Wells Fargo Financial system, that\u2019s now being eliminated and putting them in our stores.

Everything that has been done in the financial stores except for the debt consolidation portfolio loans will be done someplace else, and they\u2019re being done right now. And frankly, in the last year or two, we were doing almost zero debt-consolidation loans in the portfolio anyhow. So we\u2019re just not losing that much and the game is, we think, significant in that you bring financial bankers who are really good at loans into our stores to help our store people become better at loans, and their people help them become better at opening up checking accounts and stuff like that.

In my mind, there\u2019s a huge difference between the two at this point. I don\u2019t know if you want to address that at all on the call, but it just seems to me that there\u2019s a lot more economic value \u2013 ", "John Stumpf", "", "Yeah, but you know, actually refinance volumes have jumped quite a bit recently. I mean, there\u2019s some activity there. On the other hand, you\u2019re right, that not everyone can refinance because of the loan-to-value requirements. But if you\u2019re interested in a longer conversation on this we will surely arrange for that. But I think it\u2019s pretty obvious. We have a set of $9 million or so customers who we make 25 basis points on the servicing, which is \u2013 we discount that back, we put an asset on our balance sheet. We think that asset is conservatively valued, like you said, 70-some basis points, the lowest in the industry. In fact, I think it\u2019s the lowest we\u2019ve ever had it because rates are so low.

", "Operator", "", "Your next questions comes from the line of Joe Morford, with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "Regarding capital, can you update us as to what your current expectations are for what new requirements you may be held to as well as when you think we may hear something specific on that. And then, given the strong internal generation rates, when might we see Wells start to pull some of its capital through dividend increases or share buybacks, and where would your preference be between those two? ", "John Stumpf", "", "Well, Joe, all I can tell you is what I read because I don\u2019t know a lot more than that. You know, the Bosal [ph] 3, of course, you know, there\u2019s lots of discussion going on about that. I would expect that it\u2019s in the interest of the banks in the US, our economy, and the world that there be a resolution on that sooner than later. I don\u2019t know where those numbers are going to go, but there has to be some call about how much capital is enough. Hopefully whoever makes the call relates it to the risk inherent in the companies, you know, one sizes does not fit all here. I can tell you in our company\u2019s case, our Tier 1 is now higher than it\u2019s ever been in my 30 years with the company, or 29 years with the company. Our Tier 1 common now is as high as it\u2019s ever been. We\u2019re generating it at very rapid pace. And frankly, it\u2019s time we start rewarding our owners, our stockholders with a more representatives dividend given the performance of this company. And that\u2019s Job 1 around here. We want to get that done. ", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. ", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Hi guys. ", "John Stumpf", "", "Hey, Matt. ", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "If I could just circle back to the expense reduction conversation that you were having earlier. You know, obviously there\u2019s the opportunity of cutting costs in financial. It seems like if you\u2019re already at 80% of the Wachovia targeted cost saves and there\u2019s still a ton of integration to be done, it seems like there might be some upside there. I guess I was just hoping that you could try and size up how big all the cost savings might be, and the timing of when you might start realizing some of them. ", "John Stumpf", "", "Well, you know, as we mentioned, Matt, we\u2019ve got a lot of things in various stages of thought and development on expenses. We\u2019re still committed to realizing the $5 billion of annual savings from the consolidation. We talked about the Wells Fargo Financial; we\u2019ve put some estimates into the public on the potential positive impact of that, and timing of that going forward. And as I said, we\u2019ve got a variety of other things that are going on that are just in very early stages of development, I would say. As we know more, I can put some specificity around that. We\u2019ll disclose more of that. ", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. When do you think you\u2019ll be doing that? ", "John Stumpf", "", "Throughout the next four or five quarters probably. ", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. All right, thank you. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with IFI Group.", "Ed Najarian \u2013 IFI Group", "", "Hi, Howard. Just a quick question to clarify this accretable difference thing. Could you just give us the actual total accretable difference in the first quarter and then what it was in the second quarter so we can not only see that $300 million step up but what the actual numbers were? I know that 506 is just related to the commercial PCI portfolio and I was interested in the totals.

", "Ed Najarian \u2013 IFI Group", "I\u2019m talking about the amount that flowed through net interest income. Excuse me. ", "Howard Atkins", "", "The only thing that went through that interest income was the $506 compared with roughly $180 in the first quarter. ", "Ed Najarian \u2013 IFI Group", "So there was no consumer-related that flowed through in the second quarter? ", "Howard Atkins", "", "No because again, the consumer is just a yield, and the bulk of the increase was the billion-eight in the second quarter and that had no impact on second quarter. ", "Ed Najarian \u2013 IFI Group", "Okay. And then secondarily, on the US Bank Corp call, they indicated that the change in FDIC Insurance costs for 2011 would be about $200 million annually. You guys have a little over four times their deposits. Is that something \u2013 around $800 million a number that you would think would be about right for you guys?

", "Operator", "", "Your final question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Just a clarification, I think that the previous question was asking also about the accretion, which was like abruptly $40 million from like 640-some odd last quarter to like 680-some odd this quarter. I think that\u2019s what the reference was. ", "John Stumpf", "", "Well, $40 million, the big difference is the difference between 180 and 506. ", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just to get back on the expense side, it just seems like there\u2019s \u2013 maybe I\u2019m understanding this wrong, but if you said that you\u2019ve already got 80% of the reductions in there out of $5 billion, it means that there\u2019s a billion dollars of incremental savings, yet you\u2019ve still got 2.6 billion of spending to go. Could you kind of reconcile what that spending is going to get you if you\u2019ve got 80% of the savings? ", "Howard Atkins", "", "What it\u2019s going to get you is signage and systems conversions, in principally the non-overlapping stores on the East Coast. The sort of staff consolidation expenses are now behind us, the savings, and the bulk of the remaining expenditures gets consolidation, as I said, in the non-overlapping states. ", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Is there kind of an incremental revenue benefit because I guess otherwise it seems like \u2013 ", "Howard Atkins", "", "You\u2019ve got the benefit from having everybody on the same system, and all of the revenue benefits and cost savings comes with that going forward. ", "John Stumpf", "But the two are really not as connected as you might thing. So you have your integration and it costs money to change systems, to change signs and all the things, and you have your savings. So it wouldn\u2019t be the right analysis to say you\u2019re through 80% of your conversion, you should have 80% of your savings. Those two are really not as connected as you might think they are. ", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "All right, I don\u2019t want to harp on it, but it seemed to me that it usually went the other way, that a lot of the spending comes up front and the savings are realized afterwards. So this for some reason seems to be reversed. ", "John Stumpf", "", "Well, you know, when you have, in our case, we have two companies and you only need one CEO, you need one head of retail, one head of operations, you know, those kinds of things you make some of those changes very quickly. If you have a systems conversion that\u2019s necessary to consolidate two branches, then yeah, you can have \u2013 you spend the money first. You consolidate the systems, and then the savings come when you actually mush the branches together. But as I say, in this case, we\u2019re converting the Nation\u2019s system of systems and the bulk of the work effort there is connected with the non-overlapping states. So you have to do the work and the benefit, as I said, will be all the revenue synergies and all the other goodies that come along with having everybody on the same system.

I would now like to turn today\u2019s call over to Mr. Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today, during which our Chairman and CEO John Stumpf, and CFO Howard Atkins will review third quarter 2010 results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call and that those forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today and the earnings release and quarterly supplement included as exhibits. In addition, some of the discussion today about the company\u2019s performance will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can be found in our SEC filings and in the earnings release and quarterly supplement available on our website at wellsfargo.com.", "I will now turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thanks, Jim, and thanks to all of you for joining our call and for your interest in our company. The third quarter was the best quarter in our company\u2019s history with record earnings of $3.3 billion, up nine percent from last quarter. The strength of our diversified business model and the power of the Wells Fargo and Wachovia merger are clearly reflected in these results.", "The Wachovia merger is exceeding all of our expectations, helping us generate more than $21 billion in earnings since the merger. In the third quarter we completed the integration of Wachovia stores in our overlapping states and began the integration in our eastern states, successfully converting 170 banking stores in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee.", "This success paves the way for the rest of the eastern market conversions which will complete next year, giving millions of customer\u2019s access to more products and the largest banking store network in the United States.", "In addition to the banking stores, we have the revenue synergies we are already realizing from the merger. But let me just say, I\u2019m particularly pleased with the positive results we\u2019ve had in retaining and attracting deposits which are an important contributor to our results.", "Checking account growth remained strong throughout our company, up a net 7.3 percent with very strong growth across the east including nine percent growth in Florida and 11.2 percent growth in New Jersey as examples.", "Now, I know we\u2019ve all been hearing in recent months about business practices within our industry. I\u2019m proud of Wells Fargo\u2019s adherence to a culture of doing what\u2019s right for customers, which not incidentally benefits our team members, our communities and our shareholders in the long run. For us, this means doing the hard work early and building processes that adhere to our standards as a company.", "This is as true in our approach to merger integration as it is to our day to day business operations. Let me quickly give you my views on the latest topic related to mortgage foreclosures and repurchases. Howard will address this topic in more detail later on the call, but there are a couple of important points I want to make upfront.", "First, foreclosure is always a last resort and we work hard to find other solutions for our customers. Since January 2009, we have completed over 556,000 modifications, more than twice the number of foreclosure sales completed during this period, and we have forgiven $3.5 billion of principal to help customers stay in their homes.", "Second, we are confident that our practices, procedures and documentation for both foreclosures and mortgage securitizations are sound and accurate. Third, we did not and do not plan to initiate a foreclosure moratorium.", "As it relates to regulatory form, we continue to work internally with our regulators to better understand how reform measures may affect our business and our customers. The services we offer our customers including financial security, convenience and advice obviously have a cost, and we need to be compensated for these benefits we provide our customers and for the capital we use to support these businesses. This is not new.", "Over the years, there have been numerous environmental and regulatory issues in our industry and the breadth of our diversified model and the strength of our underlying customer relationships have enabled us to succeed in the aggregate and relative to our peers. This environment is no different.", "In the same way that helping our customers avoid foreclosure is the right thing to do for them, and our shareholders, we will work to make sure than any changes we make in response to regulatory form are in the best long-term interest of our customers, our team members and of course, our shareholders.", "Our customer centric approach has given us what I believe to be the best and most valuable franchise in the industry and our actions will be consistent with the principles that have driven our actions over the years.", "Now let me turn it over to Howard.", "Howard Atkins", "Thank you, John. My remarks this morning will follow the slide presentation included in the quarterly supplement which is available on the Wells Fargo Investor Relations website. I\u2019ve got lots of ground to cover this morning, but there are three \u2013 I\u2019m sorry \u2013 six key themes that I\u2019d like you to remember in my remarks.", "First, as John indicated, we had record results in the quarter, best quarter ever, $3.3 billion in profit with earnings per share of $0.60 or up seven percent year over year.", "Second, the way we grew earnings in the third quarter is the same as we\u2019ve done to produce strong earnings every quarter since the merger; revenue growth in most of our businesses with expenses down.", "Third, the Wachovia merger is already a big financial success for us with better than expected credit experience, expense savings on track and abundant revenue synergies.", "Fourth, we had continued improvement during the quarter in credit quality. Charge offs are now some 24 percent below the peak last year, and nine percent down from the second to the third quarter.", "Fifth, our balance sheet is stronger than ever. We\u2019ve been growing tier one common at a rate about 40 to 50 basis points per quarter organically. Tier one common hit eight percent during the quarter and while the new BASEL III rules are still in process, we expect to be above seven percent tier one common on the proposed BASEL III rules as we understand them within the next few quarters.", "And then finally, we are confident in our foreclosure and mortgage securitization policies, practices and controls and the adequacy of our repurchases, and I will get to that later on in this presentation.", "If you look at slide four, which is our earnings trend, as indicated we earned a record profit of $3.34 billion in the third quarter. This is not a new development. Quarterly profits as you know have been consistently strong since the merger two years ago. Nor, is the strength of our earnings in the quarter due to any one factor. Our results were relatively broad based across many business segments and products.", "I would like to point out a number of special items that in the aggregate reduced revenue and earnings on a link quarter basis. This would include for the first time now the impact of Reg E, which cost us $380 million during the quarter in revenue.", "Second, while we continue to have commercial loans resolutions in the PCI portfolio, $202 million in the quarter, that\u2019s down $304 million from the second quarter PCI loan resolution income. And third, we only had $17 million in bond and equity gains, down $300 million from the second quarter.", "When you add those items up, it\u2019s almost $1 billion worth of less revenue from the second to the third quarter, which means that all of our other business operations basically our core operations combined, grew revenue by some $465 million in the quarter.", "We had double-digit annualized link quarter revenue growth in a number of businesses included asset-backed finance, asset management, auto dealer services, brokerage, commercial banking, commercial mortgage servicing, commercial real estate, debit card, mortgage banking, private student lending, real estate investment banking and retirement services.", "When you add up all those businesses in which we had double digit revenue growth, that amounts to some, just under half of the total revenue of the company in the quarter.", "The third quarter results, continuing with the special items also included $476 million in merger integration expenses. Our operating losses were down close to $400 million from the second to the third quarter, largely reflecting the higher level of legal accruals we had in the second quarter, and in the third quarter we released $650 million from the allowance, reflecting the improved loan portfolio performance at Wells Fargo, and we expect additional releases in the coming quarters absent significant deterioration in the economy.", "Slide five shows you our returns and operating margins which were strong and generally up in the quarter. Return on assets was increased to 1.1 percent. Return on tangible common, 15 percent, both among the highest of the large bank peers.", "Net interest margin did decline by about 13 basis points in the second quarter, but that was largely driven by lower PCI loan resolution as I mentioned earlier.", "As you know, lots of factors impact the margin, some positively, some negatively. The decline that we\u2019ve seen in the non-strategic loan portfolio that we\u2019re running off does reduce the margin to a certain extent. On the other hand, we\u2019ve had continued and significant growth in checking and savings deposits which helps the margin.", "As I mentioned before, our earnings continue to be very broad based as has been the case for many quarters. All of our business segments continue to contribute to the company\u2019s earnings with community banking growing earnings in the quarter by 13 percent, Wholesale banking growing earnings by two percent, and while the Wealth Brokerage and Retirement group had essential flat NIAD in the quarter, earnings in this business were almost double, a little bit more than double from a year ago.", "Let me take you through each of the main business segments. On slide seven, our Wholesale banking group, you can see the trend in revenue and earnings there. Revenue in this group was down somewhat in the quarter due to the lower PCI loan resolution income and seasonal decline in insurance revenue, but many businesses in this group including customer flow trading, commercial real estate, commercial mortgage servicing and asset backed finance had double digit annualized link quarter revenue growth.", "Like our retail business, in the wholesale business, revenue to a very large extent is driven by cross sell and as I mentioned, we had many businesses that contributed to the result and to the growth in our cross sell in this business.", "We did see signs of lending activity with period and loans up during the quarter in commercial, commercial real estate, asset back finance and capital finance and as another example of increased activity, new commercial real estate loan commitments in this business segment, up 44 percent link quarter.", "Credit quality in wholesale improved once again during the third quarter with charge offs down 29 percent and a continued drop in the number of problematic loans and transfers to work out.", "In our community banking segment, community banking had a very strong sales quarter with sales up 14 percent and small business sales actually up 25 percent. We also had very solid checking account growth once again in this business.", "Lending activity picked up somewhat in community banking with loan growth during the quarter in core auto\u2019s, private student lending and SBA lending. We\u2019ve been very active for several quarters now including the third quarter in providing credit to small businesses across the country.", "On slide nine you can see our cross sell statistics which are one of the key sources of revenue growth in the company. The consumer cross sell is still increasing at legacy Wells Fargo as it has been consistently for many years, and now with Wachovia, we\u2019ve also had success in increasing cross sell in the Wachovia footprint.", "We are experiencing very broad based growth in checking accounts. This is really a very important message, very important to understand in terms of the way we\u2019re building our franchise. The growth in checking accounts in our company has been very strong, very broad based. That\u2019s a very important driver our company\u2019s strong operating and financial results.", "What this growth in account indicates is that more and more households and small businesses are banking with Wells Fargo, and this generally leads to more business and higher cross sell all the time.", "Slide 14 talks about our mortgage banking business. Mortgage banking had a great quarter in terms of originations and applications. Originations during the third quarter were up 25 percent linked quarter. Applications were up $194 billion, roughly 80 percent driven by refi\u2019s, and our second highest quarter ever.", "The chart here shows you the relationship between the average note rate on our servicing portfolio and the current 30 years mortgage rate. We think we\u2019re in a very unique period here, with a unique combination of historically low absolute levels of new mortgage rates, and in combination with that, the widest ever spread between new mortgage rates and rates on outstanding mortgages.", "So as you can see, the average note rate on our servicing portfolio in the third quarter was 5.46 percent compared with new money rates of 4.35. What this means obviously is that the incentive to refi right now is huge and by the way, the wealth effect for homeowners who are refi\u2019ing is also very huge.", "So given this unique combination of low mortgage rates and the wide spread to the servicing portfolio, the potential is very high for every homeowner in the United States that an refi to do so, and this could take several quarters to play out if rates remain as low as they are right now.", "We\u2019ve already had our second highest mortgage application ever in the third quarter, just under $200 billion in applications, and so far in October, applications remain strong.", "On slide 11, we\u2019re now in wealth and brokerage retirement business; revenue grew two percent from the second quarter. Earnings as I said before were relatively flat although more than double from a year ago.", "Client assets were up five percent. Managed accounts assets in the retail and brokerage group were up ten percent from the second quarter, and despite may retail investors being on the sidelines for the last couple of quarters, as I said, client assets were up five percent link quarter and we are growing share.", "This business closed $1.7 billion in loans during the quarter, double from a year ago and for the first time since the merger. Loans in this business were flat linked quarter and were up slightly from August to September. Cross sell continues to grow in this business as it has every month and every quarter since the merger and now stands at 9.76 products relative to 9.45 products a year ago.", "Deposits have been a great success in this business. Deposits in our wealth and brokerage business now stand at $127 billion. Essentially, this business has brought back all the deposits it lost during the dark days in 2008 and has incremental growth on top of that. A terrific success story. We now have 888 dedicated stand along brokerage offices across the country in basically all the markets where there is wealth that can be serviced.", "In terms of our lending in the third quarter, we continue to supply credit to both U.S. consumers and businesses as we have for many quarters now. Since the merger, we have supplied over $1 trillion in credit to U.S. consumers and businesses including $176 billion in the third quarter, up 17 percent from the second quarter.", "There\u2019s not just the mortgage originations that I mentioned before. We\u2019ve had good activity in home equity, credit card, C&I loans and commercial real estate.", "In terms of loans outstanding on slide 13, here is essentially a tale of two cities if you will. We\u2019ve been continuing to reduce our non-strategic portfolio. This is a portfolio comprised of about $119 billion in loans were we exited or no longer write new business including pick-a-pay, indirect home equity, legacy Wells Fargo Financial, and direct auto, Wells Fargo financial debt consolidation and commercial and CRE, PCI loans.", "As I\u2019ve said, we continue to work down these high risk portfolios, which have now declined over $30 billion since the second quarter of 2009.", "The $616 billion in the so-called continuing portfolios are down less than one percent from the second quarter so we clearly see a flattening out in our loan portfolio and as you can see on the chart, many of our individual loan portfolios grew in the quarter.", "We had growth in the auto dealer services, wealth and brokerage retirement consumer loans, wholesale commercial real estate, capital finance, asset backed finance, wholesale commercial banking and private student lending and SBA.", "This reflects in our view on the commercial side at least, some inventory and CapEx financing plus in both of our consumer and commercial businesses, what we believe is market share gains.", "We continue to experience exceptionally strong core deposit growth as you see on slide 14, particularly in checking and savings. Over 90 percent of our total funding right now is coming from core deposits and about 90 percent of our core deposits are in the form of checking and savings accounts.", "Growth in deposits actually accelerated at Wells in the third quarter and continue to be broad based with growth in the consumer and business checking accounts and deposits up in both wholesale and wealth and growth in deposit and checking accounts in basically all parts of the country.", "We, to our expenses on slide 15, non-interest expense declined $500 million roughly or four percent from the second quarter. To be fair, most of this was in the operating losses where we had higher legal accruals in the second quarter as well as in the second quarter having restructuring costs both for the Wells Fargo Financial restructuring we undertook in the second quarter.", "We continue to invest in our businesses throughout our footprint, including increasing regional banking, platform banking, FTE\u2019s in the east by some 1250 FTE\u2019s this year so far. This investment in bankers is one of the key drivers in improvement in cross sell we are already realizing in the eastern footprint.", "We have $476 million in merger expenses in the third quarter as we converted 363 stores, Wachovia stores in Texas, Kansas, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. We\u2019ve also converted many of our operating systems now improving in the third quarter our mutual fund business. The merger is on track for the $5 billion of expense savings that we have consistently articulated.", "I would like to mention here, one of our highest expense items in the last year or two, and it\u2019s obviously for problem asset management, in the third quarter we had over 24,000 people in some fashion or another working on loan modification and loss mitigation throughout Wells Fargo, and that amounts to roughly $750 million, but over time, we do expect this very high level of expenses to decline as problem assets and charge offs continue to decline.", "I\u2019d like to talk briefly about the Wachovia merger. As I mentioned earlier, this is already a big success from a financial perspective. Since the closing of the Wachovia acquisition at the end of 2008, we\u2019ve now earned $21 billion in seven quarters.", "We\u2019ve significantly reduced higher risk assets. The credit side, we are seeing better than expected quality and credit experience. For example, the life of loan losses that we now expect in the Wachovia loan portfolio will be less than the $40.9 billion write down that we initially took. We still have remaining PCI loans on our books written down to roughly 64 percent of the remaining unpaid principal balance even after using almost $23 billion. It was a non accretable difference.", "On the expense side as I mentioned, we are realizing expense saves from the merger. About 85 percent of the targeted $5 billion of consolidation savings has been realized, and then on the revenue side, we are seeing multiple revenue synergies in every one of our businesses.", "To give you a couple of examples, as I mentioned earlier, Wachovia\u2019s cross sell ratio is growing nicely. We\u2019ve grown auto dealer market share from 4.75 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 6.84 percent in the third quarter of this year.", "The auto dealer business is an excellent business that we acquired with Wachovia that has benefited from the strength of the Wells Fargo brand and the strength of our balance sheet.", "Within wholesale banking, the amount of investment banking revenue coming from our own commercial customers is up 21 percent this year, again benefiting from more legacy Wells Fargo commercial and corporate customers using Wells Fargo securities to underwrite their bond and equity financings.", "In the wealth business, cross sell as I mentioned before is up to 9.76 percent, demonstrating success this business is having at growing deposits, loans and managed assets. Loan originations by financial advisors in this business were up 33 percent year to date compared with a year ago.", "Let me now turn to credit quality, which continued to improve in the third quarter. To quickly summarize, charge offs continued to decline, down 9 percent link quarter. The early credit quality indicators in most of the consumer and commercial portfolios were either stable or continue to improve.", "Our PCI portfolio continue to perform better than originally expected. In the third quarter, $639 million of non accretable difference was reclassified to accretable yield which will accrete the future income over the remaining life of the loans. In addition, $202 million of non accretable difference was released into the income for commercial loans that were paid off or sold.", "At the end of the quarter, we had $24.4 billion in allowance for credit losses, and in addition, we had $14.5 billion in remaining non accretable difference. Because of the improved portfolio performance, we released $650 million in reserves in the third quarter and we currently expect additional releases absent significant deterioration in the economy.", "Slide 18 shows you the trend in our charge offs which as I\u2019ve indicated a couple of times are now down both link quarter and substantially lower than the peak last year. Almost all loan categories seasonal increase in auto showed a decline in charge offs during the quarter, so this is a very broad based reduction in credit costs.", "Slide 19 takes you through the early indicators in the large consumer loan portfolios, which as you can see have been stable to improving for a number of quarters now, including improvements in pick-a-pay, credit card, home equity and personal credit management.", "Non-accrual loans in total stabilized in the third quarter with the exception of a relatively small number of new large corporate non-accruals and a modest increase in the mortgage portfolio. Non-accrual balances in all other loan portfolios were flat to down in the third quarter including large declines in non-accrual\u2019s and wholesale commercial real estate division, auto dealer services, pick-a-pay and Wells Fargo home mortgage.", "Foreclosed assets and OREO increased from the second quarter but approximately half of the increase was a shift from PCI loans to real estate owned, and $148 million increase in fully insured Fanny Mae loans.", "Keep in mind most of our loans, and therefore most of our problem assets, are in secured portfolios and so the majority of the projected loss content in these assets has already been written down or is government insured.", "As I mentioned, we released $650 million in the third quarter as you can see from our allowance trends on slide 22, and absent significant deterioration in the economy as I\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times, we expect future reductions in the allowance given the improvement we are likely to see in the portfolio.", "Our appendix to this presentation includes a lot of detail on the pick-a-pay and other loan portfolios. I\u2019d just like to mention here on slide 23, since this is a large portfolio that the pick-a-pay portfolio continues to perform better than originally expected. We\u2019ve had great success in modifying loans in this portfolio, completing over 73,000 full term modifications and we\u2019ve forgiven about $3.5 billion in principal since the acquisition a year and three quarters ago.", "Because the modifications we\u2019ve completed eliminate the payment option feature, at the end of the third quarter, only 62 percent of the pick-a-pay portfolio still had payment options, down from 86 percent at the time of the merger.", "In the non PCI pick-a-pay portfolio, net charge offs continue to decline and non-performing loans declined for the first time now since the merger. 85 percent of the non PCI portfolio is current and 60 percent of the PCI portfolio is current, up two percent from the second quarter.", "Let me now shift to our capital position on slide 24. Tier one common, reach eight percent in the third quarter through retained earnings and other internally generated sources; we have been increasing tier one common by about 40 to 50 basis points per quarter now for many quarters.", "We\u2019ve always maintained very strong capital in our company and today\u2019s ratios including the eight percent tier one common, nine percent tier one leverage and 10.9 percent tier one capital are higher than they\u2019ve ever been.", "We\u2019ve now purchased about $544 million in the treasury TARP warrants year to date. So far that\u2019s at about a five basis point impact to our tier one common, but is accretive to earnings per share, and we will continue to buy the warrants opportunistically.", "A couple of points about BASEL III on slide 26, as you know, BASEL III is still in proposed form and is a subject to interpretation in many cases, but under our current interpretation of BASEL III, our adjusted tier one common ration under the new guidelines would have been about 6.9 percent at September 30, about 110 basis points below our reported eight percent tier one common ratio.", "When you look at the adjustments, the pro forma deductions from tier one common for mortgage servicing rights, for tax assets, investments in financial affiliates and other smaller adjustments to tier one common amount to about $5 billion less tier one common as of September 30, or about 50 basis points on our reported tier one common ratio, and in terms of the increase in risk rated assets, that would be associated with now capturing market risk, counter pointing risk, operating risk and other BASEL II and BASEL III risk elements, will also be the equivalent of about 60 basis points or adding about $85 billion of risk rated assets to the ratio calculation.", "We think one of the good things about BASEL in fact, is that it does better reflect relative risks taken by the different financial institutions and we believe that given the fact that effective substantially less than our peers.", "And as our asset is comparable to some of the other large mortgage banks, but we have less deferred tax assets, equity and financial affiliates, trading assets, counterparty risk. We also have less disqualified trump securities than most of the other large bank peers.", "With that, let me shift to give you an overview of the foreclosure and mortgage securitization issues. These are issues obviously very important to consumers, mortgage investors and shareholders, but we believe that these issues have been somewhat overstated and to a certain extent, misrepresented in the marketplace, and I\u2019d like to be clear here on how they impact Wells Fargo specifically.", "So starting on slide 26, first as John already mentioned, foreclosure at Wells Fargo is a last resort, not a first resort. We work very early on with customers who are beginning to experience problems paying their mortgages and continue to do so for the length of time that the problems are being experienced.", "80 percent of customers who are 60 days or more delinquent work with us, and when they do, we are successful in helping seven out of every ten avoid foreclosure. We attempt to contact customers on average over 75 times by phone, and nearly 50 times by letter during the roughly 16 months that it takes for foreclosures to be complete once a borrower becomes delinquent.", "Second, our foreclosure and securitization policies, practices and controls, in our view are sound. To help ensure accuracy over the years, Wells Fargo has built control processes that link customer information with foreclosure procedures and documentation requirements.", "Our process specifies that affidavit signers and reviewers are the same team member, not different people, and affidavits are properly notarized. Not all banks in our understanding do it this way. If we find errors, we fix them and we fix them as promptly as we can.", "We assure loans and foreclosure are assigned to the appropriate party as necessary to comply with local laws and investor requirements and legal documents related to securitizations are sound and appropriate transfers of ownership are made.", "Finally, we believe our purchase exposure is very manageable and our experience continue to be different from some of our peers in that our unresolved repurchase demands outstanding are actually down at the end of the third quarter compared with second quarter both in terms of number of outstanding demands and in total dollar balances.", "Slide 27, the key point here really comes back to the quality of our servicing portfolio. One of the reasons we\u2019re so confident in terms of our risk exposure is we have a very high quality servicing portfolio.", "As shown on slide 27, 92 percent of our portfolio is current and only two percent is sub-prime. Roughly two-thirds of our servicing portfolio is comprised of loans sold to GSE\u2019s. 20 percent of the portfolio are loans that we retained or acquired and hold on our own balance sheet, and of course the loss exposure to the extent that any exists on these retained loans will be reflected in our loan/loss reserves and PCI non-accretable difference.", "Six percent of our servicing portfolio is non-agency acquired servicing and private whole loan sales. The majority here is acquired servicing where Wells Fargo did non underwrite and securitize and therefore we have no repurchase obligation.", "And then the remaining eight percent of our servicing portfolio is private securitizations where Wells Fargo originated the loan and therefore may have some repurchase risk. But importantly, 55 percent of these loans are from the 2005 or earlier vintages and 83 percent of this eight percent are prime loans.", "We had only $69 million of repurchases related to private securitizations in the third quarter.", "As shown on slide 28, the quality of our servicing portfolio is clearly reflected in our relatively low delinquency and foreclosure rates. As of the end of the second quarter the most recently publicly available data, we had the lowest delinquency and foreclosure rates among large bank peers, ours being 8.15 percent, some 335 basis points better than the industry average of 11.5 percent, and at the end of the third quarter, our delinquency and foreclosure rate, actually improved the basis point to 8.14 percent.", "Most of the repurchase risk we have is with agencies, and is essentially concentrated in the 2006 through 2008 vintages which when the industry contained a higher concentration of low or no doc and stated income mortgages. As shown on slide 29, our purchase demands from GSE\u2019s for these vintages declined now for the second straight quarter. We don\u2019t expect large losses on the pre 2006 or post 2008 vintages.", "The balance of loans outstanding in the 2006 2008 vintages as I mentioned, continue to decline, and the percentage of loans 120 delinquent has also continued to decline. Delinquency as you know is an important measure of demands, and are generally correlated defaults.", "However, it\u2019s important to note that not all loans that become delinquent eventually are problematic, but are probably underwritten in applicable contract terms, eventually may not actually result in a repurchase.", "At the end of the third quarter, as I mentioned before, repurchase demand both in number of loans and loan balances was down. As you can see on slide 30, another fact that I think is sometimes missed is that repurchase demand does not directly result in loss. Repurchase demand simply represents an initial request for information and loans being assessed for repurchase.", "Of the repurchase demands we receive, only half roughly end up actually being repurchased with half being cured by providing additional documentation that demonstrates a contractually required repurchase event did not occur.", "Of the loans that we do repurchase, roughly 20 \u2013 25 percent of the borrowers, we are able to make current through modification. On the loans that we repurchase that we\u2019re not able to modify, the average loss severity is about 50%.", "So just to take you through the math, to recap that, as an example, for every $100 million in demands, we repurchase on average about $50 million. Of the $50 million we repurchase, $12.5 million gets modified, and on the loans we don\u2019t modify, we would on average realize a loss of about $18.75 million.", "So if you do the math on the $3.8 billion of demand if you will in the third quarter, you can see that our repurchase liability as of September 30 of $1.3 billion, we believe to be adequate to cover these potential losses.", "With that, I would now like to open up the call for any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi guys.", "John Stumpf", "Hi, Matt.", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I think I\u2019ll start with the full mortgage repurchase for a change. I guess the first question is why are you excluding the 2005 vintage? Do you think that\u2019s not going to be a material issue or hasn\u2019t been so far? I think most people are looking at \u201805 through \u201807 vintages and you show \u201806 to \u201807, so just wondering what your thoughts on \u201805 are.", "Howard Atkins", "As far as we can tell, to the extent there will be problems we see it on 2006, 2007 through mid-2008 vintages, so we don\u2019t expect any material (inaudible) prior to that.", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "OK. And then separately, the 83 percent of private securitizations that are prime, I assume those are jumbo?", "Howard Atkins", "Yes, mostly yes.", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "OK. Do you have any average statistics on the LTD\u2019s and FICO there?", "Howard Atkins", "We\u2019ll get back to you on that. I don\u2019t have those on the top of my heard.", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And just separately, like when I step back and reading all these headlines that are impacting the mortgage business in one way or another, I guess the thing that jumps out to me is the servicing business really hasn\u2019t been priced for what we\u2019re seeing right now, and maybe the cost to you of a purchase is a little bit less, but for some other competitors it seems like it\u2019s going to be a pretty high cost. So how do you think about just pricing, I guess on the origination side as well as on the servicing side for your current production and going forward?", "Howard Atkins", "Well Matt, we\u2019re always looking as we\u2019re looking at this business, first it costs more money, but if you look at, I can\u2019t remember what slide it was, I think it was 28, that tells a pretty big story there about the quality of our portfolio and that is reflective of the success we\u2019re having in that portfolio and the profitability of that portfolio.", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "OK. I guess what I\u2019m getting at is the servicing fees that you get as an industry I think are relatively modest, probably to what your costs are either to modify some of these loans, obviously the foreclosure process. I just feel like that\u2019s going to be a much bigger burden for the business going forward, and it might make sense to re-pricing some of that business right now.", "John Stumpf", "The industry might do that and of course we look at that, but clearly for the eight percent that\u2019s past due, and those are, that\u2019s expensive. There\u2019s no question about that, but you\u2019ve got to look at a portfolio from a portfolio perspective, and if the industry reacts to it, if this is a prolonged issue, I\u2019m sure that new servicing might be considered differently.", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "OK. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, good morning. Question for Howard. On the interest margin, obviously lots of puts and takes go into interest income and the margin. Could you talk about some of the offsets that you might have to run off higher yielding assets to a low persists, Howard?", "Howard Atkins", "Well one of the costs is that our security portfolio is a pretty long duration portfolio, so keep that in mind. The main one would be, as I mentioned before, the growth in share in checking accounts. We are growing checking accounts in our company at a very high rate of growth, reflecting again, more and more customers doing business with us, and that\u2019s zero cost money.", "So the more rapidly we can grow checking accounts apart from all of the other franchise benefits of doing that is that the margin does help that interest margin.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And while you do have some high yielding securities, it also seems like you have some liquidity in very low yielding stuff in terms of dry powder for the future. Is that still true?", "Howard Atkins", "That\u2019s very much true. Depending on how you define liquidity, we have as much $100 billion of potential investment power on the balance sheet. Now of course, we would hope that that gets used by loan demand picking up, and we\u2019ve already seen activity both in the second quarter, now in the third quarter as well. So that will be our wish that that\u2019s how the liquidity gets used up so we can serve our customers that way. But if rates pick up at some point, we have significant capacity to build the balance sheet.", "John Stumpf", "But John, I\u2019d also add to that, here comes into the play the beauty of this operating model. I mean, we have a diversity of geography, a diversity of businesses, a diversity of industry and about half of our revenue comes from fee for services, the other half from the margin.", "When one horse has a headwind, the other one has a tailwind, and pulls a little harder, and while these are not perfect offsets, if we continue to serve customers and customers like doing business with us, it\u2019s a privilege to serve them and in these markets we\u2019re outgrowing, like Howard said on the checking account side, we\u2019re outgrowing, you know there\u2019s now 11 percent growth in checking account in New Jersey. We\u2019re taking share.", "And no question there\u2019s some headwinds if rates stay low, but that\u2019s why you hear a lot of; everybody in the industry\u2019s talking about cross sell. We\u2019ve been talking about it for 20 years.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And is the spread on the warehouse comparable to overall margin on the company Howard, currently?", "Howard Atkins", "Well you know the warehouse loans to the extent that we\u2019re writing mortgages at 4.5 percent plus, you know yield is getting higher than the margin.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "OK. And just a question on the mortgage applications very high this quarter. Is that typically a pretty good pull through to next quarter\u2019s originations that you would take?", "Howard Atkins", "Yes, you could assume that the pipeline was up substantially during the third quarter which does bode well for fourth quarter originations, and then in addition as I mentioned earlier, so far in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve continued to see very strong application volumes.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And the final thing was just two more questions on the mortgage. The origination gains were very high this quarter. It looks like they begin on (inaudible) margin. Can you talk about origination margins and also just a little detail on servicing and why the hedging column was down and if you changed the strategy there?", "Howard Atkins", "You know origination margins in the industry remain relatively wide, which is what you would expect given the demand for mortgages being as substantial as it is. On the servicing side, the main subtle difference in terms of the hedge between the third quarter and prior quarters as you would expect, as mortgage rates continue to come down a lot, the natural business edge if you will, the origination side of the business acts a little bit better as a natural hedge to the overall mortgage company.", "So the size of the hedge, the financial hedge if you will in relationship to the overall servicing and overall business was a little bit less in the third quarter than it would have been in prior quarters, and that\u2019s one of the reasons the hedge itself was down.", "John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "OK. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So just to return the size of your hedge comes down so less earnings but you\u2019re gaining on sales higher so it\u2019s kind of a wash at least.", "Howard Atkins", "Well that\u2019s why we\u2019ve always said we have a balanced mortgage business so, a good example.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Right. Couple of other questions. One is on the BASEL III, and you laid out you know where you would be point in time in 3Q based on what you know today. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re thinking about any kind of mitigation as you move forward or should we just take that you know, effective RWA and keep that cost in the model?", "Howard Atkins", "There may be small things we do, but we have a much better situation here as I mentioned than the other big banks which is why we don\u2019t really have to do a lot of mitigation. You know some of the other banks are going to on-boarding hundreds of billions worth of RWA, and as I say, we\u2019re just not in many of those businesses or as exposed to any other business as some of the others.", "And frankly, it\u2019s a good thing that we don\u2019t have to make adjustments here because to the extent in my view, you have to make adjustments or take mitigating action that winds up in the end with less earnings for those companies that have to take mitigating action.", "So we think we\u2019re in good shape here. As I said, we\u2019re at roughly 6.9 as of the third quarter. I don\u2019t want to make a prediction. I sort of gave a general statement about being over seven percent \u201cin the next couple of quarter\u201d.", "You can see how rapidly our capital has been growing per quarter, you know 30, 40 50 basis points, so it wouldn\u2019t take that many quarters to get over seven percent. We\u2019re already at 6.9, but again, we don\u2019t know how these final rules are going to shake out and what the ultimate interpretations will be on some of these things.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And some people have been asking about the MSR as a percentage of total above the current standard, but are you thinking of it in terms of how it factors into BASEL III over time and (inaudible) 24 with 20 percent?", "Howard Atkins", "You know the MSR valuation is at a cyclical low point right now and yes, that may be things down the road on the MSR that we can think about doing that would mitigate some of the volatility if you will that gets created in the capital ratios just from that asset.", "But that\u2019s something that the industry is going to be taking a look at because as you know, we all have an MSR asset. But what I can tell you is right now, that\u2019s not a big deal for us.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Right. I realize that. And mitigating, you\u2019re talking about different ways of accounting for it or...?", "Howard Atkins", "There\u2019s different kind of actions you can have on accounting. You know, the institutional arrangements in the marketplace may get modified, so we\u2019ll have to see how this shakes out.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "OK. And then lastly on the dividend, how are you thinking about the payout ratio?", "John Stumpf", "Well first of all Betsy, we\u2019re eager to return more of our capital back to our shareholders. They\u2019ve been very patient, and you know, we historically paid in that 35 percent to 40 percent range, give or take. We\u2019ll have to see how we \u2013 appropriate level.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "OK, yeah because it looks like your earnings have been improving and consistently improving so I\u2019m just wondering what the trigger point is. Is it the systemic risk buffer getting decided?", "John Stumpf", "Well things are becoming clearer you know, but there\u2019s more clarity this quarter than it was last quarter, so we\u2019re getting closer to that point, but I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I can add anything to it other than we want to get there as soon as all parties line up.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning everyone.", "John Stumpf", "Hi Joe.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Just a couple of things. I guess first you talked about the commitments for commercial real estate lending in the wholesale business up 44 percent sequentially. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the opportunities you\u2019re seeing there and how the appetite for growing that portfolio and just some of the risks and returns for that business.", "John Stumpf", "Well, we\u2019ve had a long history in that business. We like that business. If you look at legacy Wells, we\u2019ve had people that have done that business for a long period of time very successfully, and frankly, quite successfully during this downturn.", "Secondly, we\u2019re putting more feet on the street not only in the commercial area but in our business banking area and so we are, and we\u2019re making lots of investments in relationships with companies. So you know, as others, smaller players and other players are internally focused, looking at managing their balance sheet or managing problem assets, we\u2019re finding lots of opportunity to engage with existing customers and new clients about that business, and business in general.", "So that\u2019s not new to us. This business is not new to us, and I should also tell you Joe, I think you also noticed about our business, some of our strongest cross sell is actually in the wholesale side of the business. So this is not just about capturing a loan. This is about winning a new relationship or further developing existing relationships, so the loan isn\u2019t the end all. It\u2019s relationship.", "So when you think of profitability, you\u2019ve got to think of it in more holistically.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "OK. Makes sense. And then, Howard I guess you touched on this a little bit, but I guess if you could update us a bit on the trends in the CNI and middle market portfolios just in terms of customer demand or line utilization levels and also what kind of competitive dynamics you see now in terms of pricing pressures and maybe terms.", "Howard Atkins", "The, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve been very aggressive on the commitment side, so the lines and commitments have been growing. But to be fair, the actual line utilization remains low. It hasn\u2019t gotten much lower, but sort of relatively flat the last quarter or two, but still is at a relatively low levels.", "You know we like this business. It\u2019s a bread and butter business for us. We did see some pickup in activity in the quarter, and I guess the other thing I\u2019d mention, we\u2019ve talked about this in the past. When demand generally does come back in CNI, we should be the primary beneficiary of that, because we have all the other business with many of these clients, so in terms of cash management and all the other products and services, this is very similar to the experience we had back in 2002 when (inaudible) we gained a fairly significant amount of market share during that period but we\u2019re not at that point yet.", "You know pricing is still appropriate as far as we can tell for the risks. We\u2019re not doing anything on terms to give away the business, so we\u2019d like to see more business there, but at our terms and pricing.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "OK. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Calyon.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Calyon", "Just a follow up, so what\u2019s the percentage of the loan utilization? I just use that as a measure for how much loan demand there is and what\u2019s your feeling about loan demand.", "Howard Atkins", "Well you know on balance Mike, and again you\u2019re talking about composition of portfolios, roughly in the low 30\u2019s on commercial line utilization and that\u2019s been relatively consistent for a couple of quarters now.", "And again as we say, we\u2019re seeing somewhat increased activity, but you know, it\u2019s not as robust as we would like to see it be, and as I said, we think we\u2019re picking up market share because we\u2019ve got so many relationships and all the other cross sell. So we\u2019ll just have to see when demand comes back.", "John Stumpf", "Mike, I think one of the things, one of the keys is our increase in commitments is much greater than what\u2019s happening in the portfolio, the outstandings. So we\u2019re making investments today, spending money today to win new clients, service existing clients that we\u2019re not seeing the benefit of yet.", "So when this thing does turn around, we will get a boost. It will be like a springboard, and we\u2019re willing to make those investments because those are good long term relationships for new customers who really value a company who\u2019s going to stick by them.", "Howard Atkins", "And then of course we get the fee income on the commitments, so the loan fees have been strong as we have been as I said, very successful in growing commitments.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Calyon", "And then on slide 23 you showed non-accrual loans stabilizing, but there was an uptick in both consumer and commercial non-accruals in terms of the inflows from the second to the third quarter. Not much, but it\u2019s a little bit of an uptick. Is that just timing or is that just the economy kind of slowing down a little bit.", "Howard Atkins", "You know we had one, as I mentioned earlier, the first mortgages on the consumer side which could be more seasonal, just you know one quarter to the next. All of the consumer portfolios were flat to down.", "And then on the commercial side it was largely a relatively small number of large corporate loans that went non-accrual and most of the other commercial portfolios actually saw declines in inflows.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Calyon", "One of the questions I\u2019m just really trying to get to, from your perspective since you\u2019re across the country now, is the economy getting worse, a lot worse? Do we need to QE2? What\u2019s your read from the bottom up perspective?", "John Stumpf", "Well you know Mike, I travel like probably a lot of others, a lot, and I\u2019m in a lot of different geographies. And I think it depends a bit on the type of business you\u2019re in, but in a general statement, many businesses are doing quite well.", "I mean, I don\u2019t know what the last number is, but there\u2019s more than $1 trillion of liquidity that\u2019s on corporate balance sheets, small business, medium sized businesses, large businesses that\u2019s sitting in our banks and other banks, and I don\u2019t know that I have a view on QE2 or whatever or other stimuli and so forth.", "But I think that the primary factor, when you talk to businesses, when they talk about their issues, it\u2019s not that they can\u2019t get a loan. That\u2019s a bit of an urban myth. In fact, we have our teams marching double time looking for lending opportunities. In more cases than not, it\u2019s a bunch of factors.", "You know, consumers are deleveraging, being more secular in what they spend. All these different reform measures and so forth cause uncertainty. So there\u2019s just a variety of things and I don\u2019t know that one part of the country is favored versus another.", "Some States have more foreclosures issues and higher unemployment. So we deal with unemployment as low as in the high four\u2019s, low five\u2019s in the middle part of the country to over 12 here in California. So we see a lot of different situations. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way of categorizing one versus the other.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Calyon", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "A couple of things here. Howard, you\u2019ve got more unrealized bond gains than I guess just about anybody in the industry. Would you give us your thoughts about harvesting some of these as we go down the road possibly toward higher rates someday? You know, how do you think about that and what makes that determination.", "Howard Atkins", "A couple of things, Nancy. Yes, we do have a substantial amount of unrealized bond gains and it actually went up in the third quarter but if we do come to the point where we believe that rates are likely to go up, one of the things we can consider doing to manage against that would be just to sell assets.", "You know if you remember, back in 2003/2004, that\u2019s exactly what we did. But the way we did it back then was to sell our lowest yielding assets, not our highest yielding assets. So again, the framework here is not take the gain for the sake of taking the gain and not looking to maximize the upfront gain but to clear the way if you will for repositioning the portfolio when rates go up, and do so by selling the lowest yielders.", "And we may have other assets on the balance sheet that we\u2019d consider doing so other than the securities portfolio. But the good news is, when we come to that point the likeliness is that we don\u2019t have anything in the portfolio that\u2019s at a loss right now to speak of. If we take that action, it would result in a gain.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Secondly, you mentioned about the, on the 13 basis point impact on NIM sequentially, I think you mentioned the shedding of some strategic run off portfolios etc. Would you just speak to whether you\u2019re beginning to see substantial run off from Wells Fargo Financial and the discontinued lines there and how you see that impacting margin over the next year or so.", "Howard Atkins", "Well, that is a portfolio, the debt consolidation portfolio from Financial is included now in the so-called non-strategic grouping and again, my general comment is, as those loans continue to \u2013 you know we continue to grind down that portfolio and the other portfolios, we know we\u2019re giving up some margin by doing so, but of course we\u2019re also paving the way for less risk and lower potential charge offs down the road", "So you know, net net, it\u2019s a benefit to either risk or earnings or both even though it may not be a benefit to the margin.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "John, I\u2019ve just got one quick question for you. I know you went through your thoughts about foreclosure and the fact that you have been very careful etc., etc., but there have been a couple of instances detailed in the press of Wells Fargo robo signing, etc., and there is a great deal of speculation that you know, at some point you guys are going to cave and we\u2019re going to find out all this bad stuff about your foreclosures. Could you just comment on that? Was this robo signing incident an isolated one or you know, could you just talk about that?", "John Stumpf", "Yeah, you might be talking about the one that was in the press regarding Washington State and in that case, the judge actually found in our favor and that we had done things properly. I think the key issue is what Howard covered on page 26, and I don\u2019t know if it could say it any better than that.", "I don\u2019t know how other companies do it, but in our company our process has the affidavit signer, reviewer are the same team member, and we believe these issues, they\u2019re properly notarized. And if we find an error, we\u2019ll fix it.", "You know, humans do make errors, but that\u2019s what our process. One reviewer, one signer, same person.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "OK. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Nastasio [ph] with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Chris Nastasio [ph] \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning all.", "John Stumpf", "Hi Chris.", "Chris Nastasio [ph] \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Howard, I\u2019m going to follow up on Nancy\u2019s question. She actually stole it from me if you will. What is the actual gains in the third quarter in the unrealized gains and securities portfolio?", "Howard Atkins", "$9 billion pre-tax.", "Chris Nastasio [ph] \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And a follow up, an unrelated follow up. Can you remind me when do we see the half a billion dollars of M&A expense that\u2019s related to the merger related charges for Wachovia. When does that start to wane on a quarterly basis?", "Howard Atkins", "Good question. We are obviously coming up on two-thirds done with the integration process. Many of the branch related systems have now been converted. We have done the overlapping states on the branch side. We\u2019re really now coming up to the big crunch if you will from an expense point of view and a process point of view in converting all of the non-overlapping states on the east coast up into the northeast.", "So it\u2019s going to be another couple of quarters. In fact, we may actually have higher merger integration expenses in the fourth quarter and the first couple of quarters in 2011 before this trails off during the course of 2011.", "John Stumpf", "Chris, we\u2019re still looking at finishing this, substantially be finished by the end of 2011.", "Chris Nastasio [ph] \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Great. Thank you for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks. You talked a fair amount about the checking account growth. Could you describe the process like what you\u2019re selling against and what you\u2019re seeing competitors make changes in order to offset the loss of overdraft fee revenues?", "John Stumpf", "Well first of all, customers like to invest with us and it\u2019s our privilege to serve them and we have taken the tack for many years now that we\u2019re going to be, we\u2019re going to serve customers when and how they want to be served.", "We\u2019re not going to steer somehow to an ATM because it might be cheaper to serve a customer there. We don\u2019t think in those terms. We think in terms of the customer is at the center of what we do. We invest in stores. I think we have the best store network. Stores matter.", "We think we have the best online offering. Our ATM innovation and the services that we provide there to customers are industry leading. And our phones, we have ways of serving customers there, especially the high value customers in very distinguished and differentiated way.", "So when you think of those four channels, and mobile, and they behave like a distribution community, you win more business, and I\u2019ve said this many times to many people. I get into the office about 5:30 and by quarter to six, I read the deposit report from the day before, and checking is such a big part of that.", "You know that we sell about three-fourths, more than two-thirds of our checking accounts through a package, and these are well thought out packaged products to help customers succeed. So as we move forward now and as I mentioned in my comments, regulatory reform will change the way we get paid for, in some way we get paid for our business and this will be a balancing process.", "We\u2019re going to tighten our belts. We\u2019ll get paid differently in some cases for the products and services. At the end of the day, our goal is right where our vision and values is, helping customers succeed financially and satisfying all their needs.", "And that strategy is winning in the marketplace because we\u2019re outgrowing the natural growth in those places, and we\u2019re taking share from others.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Ok. A separate question. A bunch of people asked about NSR\u2019s. Could you talk about the outlook for the valuations of NSR\u2019s given that you\u2019re going to be in this low rate environment, but it\u2019s not clear whether the pace of refi\u2019s going to increase? How do you think the NSR valuation, already at a pretty low level tracks as we go forward?", "Howard Atkins", "Well, we are carrying now at really historically low levels and it remains to be seen. However the pace of refi\u2019s picks up or not, but you know net net in terms of economics, this kind of refi market helps earnings not hurts earnings with rates being down at this level, even with accelerate refi\u2019s in the marketplace.", "And secondly, as you may remember, we tend to pick up market share during big refi waves, so this is good for us both in terms of just the economics of what happens in a refi as well as market position.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Goldberg with Barclay\u2019s Capital.", "Jason Goldberg \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital", "Thank you. Just looking at the average balance it looks like residential, commercial and CNVS\u2019s. I guess that\u2019s non agency stuff went from an increase on (inaudible) but the balance is unchanged. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s tied to changes in accretable yield because maybe you just flushed that out.", "Howard Atkins", "We had in the quarter some payoffs of previously impaired CMVS\u2019s so this is stuff that we would have written down that actually improved and that got reflected in the yield in the quarter.", "Jason Goldberg \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital", "Without the accretable yield impact, either probably absolute or kind of link quarter change, maybe talk about your outlook on a quarter basis and then talk to maybe kind of how you see the whole accretable yield thing playing out going forward.", "Howard Atkins", "Well again, we\u2019re not going to give guidance on that, and there\u2019s so many factors as you know that impact the margin. But you the point I made before is that the bulk of the 13 basis point drop was due to the change in loan resolution income that went through the quarter, so we continue to have loan resolution income. It\u2019s just that it was down a $200 million in the quarter, and that really was the main change.", "Interestingly, if you take that away as I say, even though we had decline in earning assets and loans, our net interest income, if you again put aside the loan resolution part of it, was not really down in the quarter. And again, that comes back to the fact that we\u2019re growing deposits.", "We may not at the margin right now be earning you know, four percent on every single checking account that we get, but every single checking account that we grow in this company is earning something, and it\u2019s showing up on the margin.", "John Stumpf", "You know another way of saying that Jason is the margin is the result of what we do not the reason of how we do things. I mean, we run the business the way we think is best for our constituents, and it results in a margin. We don\u2019t wake up in the morning and say we have to have a margin of 425 or 450 or four percent or incremental business. We think it\u2019s really the result of.", "Jason Goldberg \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital", "Got you. And then I guess credit card fees were actually up link quarter despite a lot of banks being down due to the card act. Is anything in particular going on there?", "Howard Atkins", "Activity and building the business. You know, as we penetrate our customer base with more cards, especially on the Wachovia side in particular, and as activity grows in the company, you get more fees for it. So that\u2019s a good story because that did offset \u2013 you know the growth in that business actually offset the impact of the card act \u2013 more than offset it.", "Jason Goldberg \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mago [ph] with GIC.", "Ron Mago [ph] \u2013 GIC", "Hi. Thanks. In regard to these deposit fees were down $300 million in the quarter and I\u2019m wondering how much of the Reg E affect has been felt at this point.", "Howard Atkins", "I\u2019m sorry; I missed the end of your question, Ron.", "Ron Mago [ph] \u2013 GIC", "How much of the Reg E effect has been felt. So in other words, how far down, how much further down do we have to go in deposit service charges?", "Howard Atkins", "Well we had, as we quantify the Reg E impact, was 380 in the quarter, so you know 380 down from Reg E and only 300 down in total, so we actually did have some growth.", "Ron Mago [ph] \u2013 GIC", "But what percent of the Reg E effect has been felt now was really my question.", "Howard Atkins", "We\u2019re assuming roughly the same kind of number, maybe a little bit higher in the fourth quarter.", "Ron Mago [ph] \u2013 GIC", "I\u2019m sorry, same effect, or same level of deposit base?", "John Stumpf", "It could be a bit more because when some of this went into place, it was staggered in during the quarter.", "Howard Atkins", "Again, keep in mind Ron; this is before any actions that we may take to offset this in coming quarters in terms of pricing, product changes, so on and so forth. So that\u2019s sort of the gross impact.", "Ron Mago [ph] \u2013 GIC", "So in other words, we could see, I just want to be 100 percent clear. We could see the same dollar drop in the fourth quarter from Reg E?", "Howard Atkins", "See the same dollar impact, right. So we already had 380 off in the third quarter. You know that might go up a tad in the fourth quarter. Again, I know exactly know yet what the number will be because it will depend a lot of customer experience. But it won\u2019t go down by another 380 in the fourth quarter, right. We already had 380.", "Ron Mago [ph] \u2013 GIC", "I\u2019m sorry; I\u2019m really slow on this. So is it the drop that will be the same or the level, the current level that will be the same in the fourth quarter the $1.1 billion.", "Howard Atkins", "There may be some additional drop in service charges in the fourth quarter from the third quarter depending upon what customer experience looks like, but it won\u2019t be another $380 million because from the second quarter to the third quarter we had, the third quarter was the first quarter we had the impact.", "Ron Mago [ph] \u2013 GIC", "And then in the fourth quarter, by the end of the fourth quarter you should have felt 100 percent of the impact.", "Howard Atkins", "Correct.", "Ron Mago [ph] \u2013 GIC", "OK. Thanks. And then I have a question about tier one common. You know on the slide on page 25, the reported tier one common ratio was up $0.40 but the pro forma was up $0.70 and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s anything special.", "Howard Atkins", "Yes. I\u2019m glad you asked that question because given the way BASEL III works, again you have deferred tax assets and other items there, our deferred tax asset position is being realized very quickly because we\u2019re charging off the PCI loan.", "So the way PCI works is, we already reserved for it two years ago, but as we actually charge off the loans, there\u2019s not accounting impact on earnings, but we get the tax benefit realized right away. So you should expect to see our tier one common on BASEL III basis rise more quickly than our retained earnings would be in tier one common as reported.", "Ron Mago [ph] \u2013 GIC", "OK. Thanks. That was my question. And then one last question. You mentioned Howard that the rising commercial non-performers reflected a few large corporate credits, and I guess I was a little surprised at that because Moody\u2019s and so on are reporting much lower corporate defaults and everything so I was wondering if you could elaborate on that point.", "Howard Atkins", "You know we have a large corporate portfolio now and from one quarter to the next it goes up, it goes down, lumpy.", "Ron Mago [ph] \u2013 GIC", "Was there any concentrations?", "Howard Atkins", "No.", "Ron Mago [ph] \u2013 GIC", "OK. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "Thanks. Just a quick follow up on the deposit fee issues. I believe you guys lost a Federal case on high to low regarding debit fees, and I didn\u2019t know a, if you\u2019d been able to get a stay on that issue, and b, if that does hold, and I think it requires you to stop high/low on debit on November 30. Would that, how much would that affect your deposit fee income?", "John Stumpf", "We\u2019re appealing that and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything more to say about that right now. It\u2019s on appeal.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "OK. Thanks, John. And then on the, I\u2019m just curious regarding the BASEL numbers, Howard, and maybe I missed it. You\u2019re only ten basis points away on the tier one common according to the best guess of calculations. I know it\u2019s preliminary at this point in time. Any guidance where the total tier one with the 8.5 percent requirement would be under BASEL?", "Howard Atkins", "Again, you can roughly add the spread on our recorded ratios between the two, so you\u2019ve got some 200 basis points, 200 to 250 basis point spread between tier one common and tier one regulatory in our case.", "Now there\u2019s some disallowance for trumps [ph], but in the case of our trumps, $19 billion or so of trumps that count against tier one but not tier one common, about $7 billion of the 19 converts to qualifying capital, so we\u2019re down to 11 or 12, which right now would only amount to about 50 basis points or so on the tier one ratio.", "So again, you can roughly assume 200 to 250 basis point spread between the tier one common and the tier one regulatory.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "Under BASEL, so you would get credit for the perpetual preferred you have and then the $7 billion of trumps that would convert, is that correct?", "Howard Atkins", "Correct. Exactly.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carol Berger with Soleil Securities.", "Carol Berger \u2013 Soleil Securities", "Hi there. Just a little minutia. Last quarter you took about $400 million in litigation reserves, but you didn\u2019t talk about that this quarter. Anything?", "Howard Atkins", "No. We\u2019re down from the second quarter and nothing special in this quarter.", "Carol Berger \u2013 Soleil Securities", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FDR Capital Market.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FDR Capital Market", "Thank you very much. A question on mortgage banking. Right now you mention that you\u2019re getting four to 4.5 point gross and there\u2019s gain on sale margins, and it\u2019s really been a big surprise for the whole industry how well it\u2019s done, and we\u2019re looking for another strong fourth quarter. How long do you think it can last as rates sitting down here at 2.50? And is this a new change in policy in the industry because it appears that a lot of the big guys control the space, didn\u2019t really expand capacity, and is it just a really good sign for the whole industry in general?", "Howard Atkins", "The mortgage earnings are you know, what they are. I\u2019m not quite sure where you\u2019re going with the question. Our margins are very good right now. We\u2019re adding capacity. We\u2019re getting tremendous flows of business. It\u2019s continuing into the fourth quarter, so yes, if rates remain at these kind of levels, I would expect us to continue for at least another couple of quarters.", "John Stumpf", "These are also very good rates for consumers. They\u2019re also big wins. Consumers on average are picking up over 100 basis points reduction on loans, so this is one of these win/wins.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FDR Capital Market", "I guess where I\u2019m going with this is, is this a change in overall industry, because at times when we\u2019ve seen rates fall like this, I mean capacity was added so quickly and the gain on sale margins were not sustainable. I mean, I was hoping that these gain on sale margins would be much more sustainable than they were in the past and the lumpiness in the mortgage banking earning may be more smoother.", "John Stumpf", "Well if you think about the past, in the past there was a time when it was very little margin in the prime business because there was outside margins in the subprime business. And like I said, just a couple of seconds ago, Howard said, we\u2019re adding capacity.", "This is good for consumers. It\u2019s good for the industry. So things change and we\u2019re making a fair return on this, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s much more story. We continue to add capacity and adjust as we see business flows.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FDR Capital Market", "I guess, I mean can we expect to see these type of margins you think for the next couple quarters then or leave it at that?", "John Stumpf", "We don\u2019t give guidance on that, but you can expect that we will...", "Howard Atkins", "If demand remains strong, margins are going to be good, right?", "John Stumpf", "We\u2019re going to serve our customers.", "Paul Miller \u2013 FDR Capital Market", "OK. Thank you very much gentlemen.", "Operator", "Your last question will come from the line of Andrew Marcourt with Evercourt [ph] Partners.", "Andrew Marcourt \u2013 Evercourt [ph] Partners", "Morning guys.", "John Stumpf", "Morning Andrew.", "Andrew Marcourt \u2013 Evercourt [ph] Partners", "I wanted to circle back on the mortgage securitization issue and the repurchase. Can you just give us a sense of where you think we are in the kind claim cycle if you will in terms of how, are we through 50 percent of the amount of claims you expect or 75 percent? How do you think about it?", "Howard Atkins", "Well again, as we said earlier, we believe that most of the issues are in those 2006 to 2007 through 2008 vintages, and we\u2019ve been working on those vintages with the agencies for five, six, seven quarters now. I can\u2019t tell you precisely how far through we are with it, but it\u2019s got to be the majority of the vintage that belong to those vintages are already behind us now.", "And as we indicated earlier, that\u2019s probably one of the reasons why we\u2019re seeing repurchase demand requests actually decline in the last two quarters.", "Andrew Marcourt \u2013 Evercourt [ph] Partners", "Any repurchase requests from the private label side?", "Howard Atkins", "We had $69 million worth. Very modest. And again, the reason for that, that\u2019s a very small part of our servicing portfolio unlike many of the other big bank peers. We didn\u2019t do a lot of label securities.", "John Stumpf", "It\u2019s a small part and most of that part is private.", "Howard Atkins", "And pre 2006 vintages. So we don\u2019t see those being a big issue.", "Andrew Marcourt \u2013 Evercourt [ph] Partners", "OK. And then in terms of maybe I missed it. In terms of, you had mentioned at least in the release about the reserves continuing to down. I think you had mentioned any color in terms of the degree how we should think about the pace of that continuing, also maybe the context of MPA\u2019s not going down. How do we think about reserve release going forward?", "Howard Atkins", "Well again, we can\u2019t really give you guidance on that. The allowance that we had at the third quarter was adequate for the risks that we see. If you want to think about it may be overly simplistically, our charge offs per quarter are now down $1.3 billion from the peak. So you can do your own math in terms of what that means for an annualized charge off rate and draw some conclusions about where the allowance might go over a period of time if charge offs remain low and continue to go down.", "Andrew Marcourt \u2013 Evercourt [ph] Partners", "OK. Thanks. And then the last question is on capital. When in fact did you get the green light to have more flexibility in deploying capital? What would be the kind of top priorities from your perspective?", "Howard Atkins", "Well I think John said it before. The dividend is a top priority for us, and that\u2019s important to our shareholders. Our shareholders have been very patient with us, so that will be the first place to go.", "We have been and will continue to buy back the warrants when it\u2019s economically beneficial for our shareholders for us to do so. We\u2019ll continue to invest in the business. We hopefully will be able to do some opportunistic share repurchase.", "Another use of capital, you know we talked about the trump securities before. You know we may cull some of those to the extent that we can replace with lower cost senior debt, so there\u2019s lots of ways we can improve earnings for our shareholders by deploying capital going forward.", "Andrew Marcourt \u2013 Evercourt [ph] Partners", "Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Well thanks everybody. We ran a little over time, but it was important and we thank you for our interest in our company and we will see you next quarter at this time.

My name is Celeste, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn today's call over to Jim Rowe. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jim Rowe", "Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and CFO, Howard Atkins, will review fourth quarter 2010 results and answer your questions. ", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call and that those forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today and the earnings release and quarterly supplement included as exhibits. In addition, some of the discussion today about the company's performance will include reference to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can be found in our SEC filings and in the earnings release and quarterly supplement available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining this call. And again, thanks for your interest in Wells Fargo. I'm very pleased with our record results for the year and the fourth quarter, which again demonstrate the power and momentum of our franchise. We continue to focus on meeting the financial needs of our customers, and as a result, we grew revenue, loans, deposits and cross-sell, as well as increased market share across our businesses. We also experienced significant improvement in credit quality in the quarter, continuing the steady improvement we experienced throughout 2010. The Wachovia merger continues to exceed all of our expectations and we are particularly pleased with the positive customer response we have received as we begin integrating the Wachovia stores in our Eastern states. In fact, for the second consecutive year, Wells Fargo ranked number one among large banks in the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Our internal metrics indicate greater customer retention and deepening customer relationships even as we completed increasingly complex merger activities.", "For example, we've already replaced more than 5,000 Wachovia ATMs, with all of our over 12,000 ATMs now on one operating platform. Simply by offering our customers in the East the same web-enabled, Envelope-Free ATMs we have in the West, ATM deposit transactions in our Eastern markets increased 55%. This is just one example of how we continue to execute our business model while serving our customers when, where and how they want to be served.", "Deposit growth remained strong throughout our company with net checking account growth of 7.5%, including California up 8.2% and Florida, up 10%. Since the merger, we have grown core deposits by $53 billion while favorably changing the composition from higher-cost CDs to lower-cost checking and savings accounts. In fact, listen to this, at the time of the merger, 23% of our core deposits were in CDs compared with less than 10% today. Just this past weekend, we successfully completed the systems integration of our Retail Brokerage business. As a consequence, we now have over 15,000 financial advisors in all 50 states on one common platform, state-of-the-art and very robust trading, planning, and investment platform activities and capabilities.", "This further enables cross-seller, cross banking, wealth management and brokerage customers nationwide. Even as we celebrate the outstanding success of the Wachovia merger to date, we continue to focus intently on the remaining work ahead, converting the rest of the East Coast Wachovia banking stores to Wells Fargo throughout 2011.", "Turning to the issue of regulatory reform. We have always been supportive of changes designed to better protect and serve consumers, businesses and the financial system. In some cases, however, such as the currently proposed control of debit interchange fees, suggested changes may have unintended consequences for the U.S. consumer, which causes our industry some concern. We believe that lawmakers should engage all constituents, merchants, consumers and banks, and take the necessary time to reach a reasonable and equitable solution. In that way, we can all help make our regulatory and operating framework a positive one for our customers, the banking industry and the overall health of the U.S. economy.", "As a company with more than 280,000 team members, our focus in this period of a new normal will be, as always, on how we best serve our customers by providing more value. So we are focusing on reducing expenses, be more efficient and nimble, and increasing revenue by winning more customers and deepening existing relationships and thereby limiting the impact of regulatory reform costs on our customers.", "Granted, there will be some costs that will be passed along to customers. We've begun to implement some changes and there are more to come. But these decisions will always be made with the customer at the center. As we work through these changes, we will focus on three things: Providing our customers with choices and education about their options; rewarding customers for doing more business with us; and finally, offering meaningful value at fair prices.", "With the evolving environment, we are more convinced than ever that our commitment to helping our customers succeed financially will create the best long term value for shareholders. Now let me turn this over to Howard", "Howard Atkins", "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the slide presentation, included in the quarterly supplement that's available on the Wells Fargo Investor Relations website. I've got a lot of ground to cover this morning. As shown on the Slide labeled Fourth Quarter Overview, I'd like to organize my remarks around five key areas.", "First, our earnings were once again very strong, a record $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Perhaps more important was the high quality of our results with broad-based revenue growth across a large number of our 80-plus businesses, and acceleration of checking and savings account deposit growth. Now loan growth in total and in loan portfolios other than the non-strategic portfolio, which we've been running off.", "Second, we had a significant improvement in credit quality in the quarter, with nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets now down this quarter and net charge-offs down once again after having peaked over a year ago. In terms of mortgage securitization, now we continue to experience declining repurchase demands, outstanding demands in total are only about $2.1 billion right now, and we consider the $1.3 billion reserve as of 12/31/2010 to be adequate given what we are seeing from investors.", "On a regular form, I'll spend some time discussing the actual Q4 impacts, as well as our evolving cost estimates and how we are thinking about the issues here. And on capital, we had a 12% annualized internal capital generation in the fourth quarter. Capital ratios are higher than they've ever been in terms of Basel III, Tier 1 common, we had approximately a 7% ratio and our objective of course is to build Tier 1 common, while at the same returning capital to shareholders at a more normal level.", "On Slide 3, you can see our earnings have been very strong every quarter since the merger with Wachovia. We earned a total of $24.6 billion over the past eight quarters, including the record $3.4 billion earned in the fourth quarter, which represents a 15% return on tangible common. Our earnings increased 9% linked quarter annualized and 21% year-over-year, producing a $0.61 earnings per share in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, a year ago, our EPS was $0.08 a share, but that reflected the $0.47 reduction for the TARP preferred stock dividend, including the redemption of TARP in the fourth quarter of 2009. Apart from TARP, our EPS was up 11% year-over-year on a 10% larger base of diluted average shares outstanding.", "Now, there were a number of items in the fourth quarter that affected revenue and earnings, and demonstrate the quality of our results. As you can see on Slide 4, I'd like to go over some of these in some detail. First, the full quarter revenue impact from REG E was $431 million pretax in the quarter, up $51 million from the third quarter. And if you remember, the changes here started in the middle of the third quarter. As more customers opt in and we make product changes, we expect this revenue impact to diminish progressively over the next two years, and I'll have more to say about that in a moment.", "We continue to earn income on our PCI commercial loans that were sold at gains or otherwise favorably resolved. We had $99 million of PCI loan resolution income in the quarter, down $103 million from the third quarter. Given the fact that we marked the Wachovia Loan portfolio at the widest credit spreads in the cycle, and given the success we've had in resolving problem loans, loan resolution income has actually averaged about $186 million in the eight quarters since the merger, and we see some additional potential for additional resolution income as the economy and markets improve but of course, with fewer loans to work out and hard to predict exactly when that may occur. We had equity gains of $317 million in the quarter compared with $131 million in the third quarter. Now this is a more regular source of earnings for our company. We've averaged about $195 million of gains in the past four quarters largely from the private equity portfolio and given the relatively buoyant stock market, there\u2019s some potential for additional gains going forward here. We had $268 million of bond losses, almost all due to the sale of our lowest yielding securities, which we repositioned at higher rates prevailing at quarter-end and early first quarter. This offset almost all of the equity gains in the quarter. Merger integration expenses totaled $534 million, up $58 million from the third quarter. And if you remember, we said that the fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2011 would be the peak quarters roughly in terms of the integration. These expenses, of course, will go away after we finish the integration in late 2011 and early 2012.", "In the quarter, we made a $400 million charitable contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. We typically contribute about 1% of annual earnings each year to the foundation, so the fourth quarter contribution covers three full years of estimated funding and estimated expenses for the foundation.", "We typically have higher expenses in the last quarter of each year. If you look at the advertising, travel and equipment expenses in the quarter, which is where most of the seasonality occurs, Q4 was higher than Q3 by over $300 million. Foreclosed asset expense was $452 million, up $86 million from the third quarter. These costs will remain elevated in the near-term before declining as problem assets declined. Next reflecting the improvement in credit quality, we had an $850 million reserve release in the quarter, and we expect additional releases in the future absent significant deterioration in the economy. I'll discuss in a moment some additional items in our mortgage business, including an increase in repurchase reserves, higher foreclosure costs and volume-related expenses in that business. Now while I like to say, our earnings are our earnings, I've noted these particular items on this slide which includes more unders than overs, simply to underscore the very high quality of our earnings in the fourth quarter.", "Slide 5, our earnings growth in the fourth quarter was driven by two main factors, one of which was the very strong revenue that we had in the quarter. In the next few slides, I'll highlight for you just how strong and just how broad-based our revenue was across products, across segments, across geography and across customers. Given the fact that we operate and cross-sell across 80 some odd different businesses, our quarterly revenue has been relatively diverse in most quarters, but in this quarter particularly so. 2/3 of our businesses generated revenue growth in the quarter, in the aggregate producing 12% linked quarter annualized revenue growth. Over 60% of the company's $21.5 billion in fourth quarter revenue came from businesses that produced double-digit revenue growth. This revenue growth was broad-based across all product lines. We began seeing signs of some loan demand two quarters ago and in the fourth quarter, that translated into an increase in loan outstandings, which were up in 2% in total and up 6% linked quarter annualized in portfolios other than the non-strategic loans we were running off. We've had strong core deposit growth now for many quarters, and in the fourth quarter, checking and savings account growth accelerated to 17% annualized from the prior quarter. As John mentioned, about 90% of our core deposits are now in the form of checking and savings, reflecting the success we've had in gaining, retaining and building household and business relationships. Mortgage originations were up 27%. We had a continued increase in client assets and wealth brokerage and retirement, which were up 12% annualized. Trust and investment fees, which included brokerage and investment banking fees rose 15%. So you can see across many, many product lines very strong growth.", "On Slide 6. Each of our business segments had a solid quarter. Community Banking earned $2 billion in profits on $13.5 billion in revenue. Core product sales in this business reached $7.1 million sales in the West, up 17% from a year ago and grew at double digits in the East year-over-year. Sales were strong in both consumer and small business and across geographies. We saw a linked quarter, loan growth in auto, private student lending and SBA lending. And as shown on Slide 6, many diverse businesses within the Community Bank had linked quarter double-digit revenue growth. Now global remittance, an interesting one, is an interesting example of the traction we are getting in our revenue growth from the combination with Wachovia. Remittance transaction volume increased 41% to $1.42 billion in 2010. The Global Remittance business is benefiting from revenue synergies with Wachovia, with over 30% of the increase in dollar volume in the fourth quarter coming from Wachovia stores that have converted to Wells Fargo. Now this was a product that was not offered at Wachovia stores prior to the merger.", "Our Wholesale Banking Group earned $1.6 billion on $5.8 billion in revenue. This business had linked quarter loan growth for the first time since the merger, including loan growth in commercial banking, Commercial Real Estate, asset-backed finance, capital finance, government banking, equipment finance and international. Wholesale banking has grown revenue consistently for many quarters, in fact, many years, as it has gained more customers and cross-sold deeper into its relationships. This revenue growth in the quarter also reflects merger synergies. For example, in investment banking, revenue coming from our commercial customers, that was up 44%, in large part as more of our current relationships use Wells Fargo Securities to underwrite their bond and equity financings.", "Our Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement business had solid linked quarter revenue growth, up 18%, as client assets grew to $1.3 trillion, up 12% linked quarter annualized. Client demand for managed account relationships continue to be strong as managed account assets grew 30% annualized from the third quarter. Brokerage lines of credit increased 18% annualized. We now have more than 15,000 financial advisors who are increasingly focused on meeting our customers' total financial needs and who originated loans of 50% in this group in 2010. This business is an increasingly important growth business for us and an increasingly important source of cross-sell.", "On Slide 7, as you can see, the main reason our revenue has been so strong and so consistent is that our business model leads to greater market share and greater share of wallet. In the fourth quarter, retail cross-sell for all households combined was 5.7, up from 5.47 a year ago. Cross-sell was up about 4% in the West, and up even more in the East as Wachovia stores adopt the Wells Fargo sales model. We still have what we think is roughly a 20% revenue growth opportunity in the East simply by increasing cross-sell in the East up to the West cross-sell of 6.14. Importantly, on Slide 7, we show the market share data starting with the first quarter after the merger through the last available quarter. And there are two things I'd point out about the market share data.", "First, you can see just how much market share we've gained after having put the two companies together at the end of 2008. And second, you can see just how broad-based our market share growth has been in virtually every type of financial services that households or businesses need and want.", "Before turning to credit quality, I would like to make a few points about the mortgage business on Slide 8. Mortgage banking non-interest income increased $258 million in the fourth quarter. Not coincidentally, we also had approximately $200 million of higher operating expenses in the quarter to process all these originations. An example of our ability to modify capacity and variable expenses up and down as volume ebbs and flows. On Slide 8, for purposes of analysis, we've broken down mortgage fees into component parts, originations and servicing. On the origination side, the total gain on origination activities was $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, but that included $464 million provided for repurchase reserves, up $94 million from the third quarter. This addition primarily reflected an increase in loss severity projections, even though unresolved repurchased demands are down again in the quarter.", "The $2.9 billion gain from origination activities was up 27% from the third quarter on a 27% increase in originations. All in, servicing revenue was $240 million in the quarter. I'm often asked where in the income statement we account for higher residential foreclosure costs. And in fact, the present value of projected residential mortgage foreclosure costs is reflected in the MSR valuation. So when foreclosure expenses are projected to rise, the full higher expected costs reduce current period earnings to a reduction in the MSR. As you can see on this slide, we reduced the value of our MSR by $143 million in the fourth quarter for higher projected servicing and foreclosure costs. We review and adjust our servicing and foreclosure cost projections within our MSR valuation each quarter and have been adding to this cost for several quarters now to reflect the current higher cost environment.", "The ratio of MSRs as a percent of loan serviced for others was 86 basis points, up slightly from 72 basis points in the third quarter, simply due to the higher mortgage rates in the quarter. But we expect we will once again be at the lower end of the piers on this metric.", "Let me now shift to credit quality starting on Slide 9. In addition to building the franchise, the second key reason our earnings were so strong in the quarter was because credit quality improved significantly. Charge-offs declined again as they have in every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2009 and are now 29% below the peak. We've indicated in the past that given our particular loan portfolio mix, the peak of nonperformers would lag the peak in charge-offs. Nonperforming loans appear now to have peaked and were down $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, with new inflows dropping significantly and outflows accelerating. Provision expense was $2.99 billion, down $456 million including an $850 million reserve release and reflecting the $256 million quarterly reduction in losses. Absent a significant deterioration in the economy, we expect future reductions in the allowance for loan losses.", "Our allowance for credit losses stands at $23.5 billion at year end. That's 6.1x quarterly charge-offs. In addition, the PCI nonaccretable difference of $13.4 billion represents about 29.5% of the remaining PCI unpaid principal balance.", "On Slide 10. Not only were charge-offs down in the quarter, but virtually all of our leading credit metrics point to continued improvement. As I mentioned, nonperforming assets were down linked quarter for the first time since the merger with Wachovia, down 6%. Nonperforming loans declined $2.1 billion from the third quarter, with reductions in C&I, Commercial Real Estate construction and each of the consumer loan categories. Total nonperforming inflows were down 13% and outflows increased 21%. Criticized classified assets were down roughly 10%, apart from some definitional changes, the biggest decline we've had so far in this cycle. We also continue to see a reduction in loans 90-plus days past due and still accruing. We\u2019ve seen the path decline now four consecutive quarters. Commercial loans 90 days or more past due improved significantly from the third quarter, down 40%. And finally, early stage delinquencies declined from the third quarter, quite a positive development actually since fourth quarter is usually a seasonally higher quarter for delinquencies, as you can see from the fourth quarter of 2009.", "On Slide 11. This improvement in credit quality in large part reflects the success we've had over the last two years and into the fourth quarter, reducing higher risk asset portfolios. On this slide, we showed the decrease in our higher risk nonstrategic portfolios since the merger with Wachovia, which are now down a total of almost $55 billion, or 32% over the past two years. This portfolio has been reduced significantly in the aggregate and in each type of portfolio we have decided to exit. Now while these portfolios do have an interest yield, they are breakeven at best after considering charge-off rates and workout and loan resolution costs. And of course, these loans also tie up a lot of capital. So this portfolio will continue to decline.", "The PCI portfolio continued to perform better than expected. Over the past two years, we've only had to add about $1.6 billion to the reserves related to PCI loans in the Commercial portfolio, due to improved expected cash flows in the PCI portfolio, largely the Pick-a-Pay portion of that portfolio and also due to commercial loans that have already been resolved. We've released a total of $5.3 billion of nonaccretable difference, with $1.5 billion recognized in earnings since the merger from loan resolutions and $3.7 billion recognized through accretable yield over the life of the loans. Again, this was not a big factor in the fourth quarter results.", "While the nonaccretable balance has absorbed $22 billion of losses related to PCI loans, we have $13.4 billion of nonaccretable difference remaining, covering, as I said before, 29.5% of the remaining unpaid principal balance. Actual quarterly losses have been declining, and we're $836 million in the fourth quarter on the PCI portfolio compared to a $2.8 billion eight quarter average. In other words, actual quarterly losses on the PCI portfolio are down significantly, which is what you'd expect after working with these assets for two years now.", "On Slide 12, talk about mortgage securitization. Last quarter, we gave you a lot of detail regarding the quality of our Servicing portfolio and our purchase reserves. Let me provide just a few updates for you this quarter.", "As you can see on this slide, our Residential Servicing portfolio is predominantly comprised of agency paper, nearly half of the loans in the Servicing portfolio were originated through our retail channels and less than 2% was subprime at origination. The majority of originated or acquired nontraditional product such as Pick-a-Pay, Wells Fargo debt consolidation and home equity is on our balance sheet and, therefore, losses on these loans have been handled through loan loss reserves and PCI nonaccretable, and therefore, have no repurchase risk.", "Quality of our Servicing portfolio is reflected in our low delinquency and foreclosure rate. As of the end of the third quarter, the most recently available quarter publicly, we continue to have the lowest delinquency and foreclosure rate among large bank peers. Our delinquency and foreclosure rate continued to decline in the fourth quarter and was down at around 8%, which is counter to typical higher fourth quarter seasonality. In fact, we've not seen the delinquency rate improve during the fourth quarter in at least the last 10 years. It's also down significantly from a peak of 8.96% a year ago.", "Our outstanding agency repurchased demands continued to decrease in the fourth quarter, with both the number and the dollar volume of demands outstanding down nearly 50% from the second quarter peak. Total outstanding agency demands are down to $1.5 billion, and the most problematic vintages in terms of losses continue to be 2006 through 2008. We saw new demands in those vintages drop for the third consecutive quarter in Q4. New non-agency repurchased demands based on loan count have declined now for three consecutive quarters, with only $137 million of repurchases in the fourth quarter. The repurchased demand levels reflect the quality of our non-agency portfolio. In terms of private securitizations in the non-agency portfolio, 70% are jumbo loans, 81% were prime loans at origination, 58% were originated prior to 2006. We have an insignificant amount of Home Equity in this portfolio and approximately 50% of our private securitizations do not have traditional reps and warranties and therefore, by definition are not subject to repurchase risk. Now the segment of the private securitizations where we might have the possibility of higher risk which would be the combination of subprime 2006, 2007 vintages, with reps and warranties and with current LTV's close to 100%, that combination represents only 6% of the total private securitizations, in other words, less than one half of 1% of total securitizations.", "Let me now touch on regulatory reform on Slide 13 and talk a little bit about Q4 impacts and how we are thinking about the issue more generally. First, on REG E, if you remember, REG E went into effect in the middle of the third quarter, so Q4 was the first full quarter impact. We calculated about a $270 million after-tax impact in the fourth quarter that's very consistent with our prior guidance on the subject. We expect 2011 quarterly averages impacts to decline over time, perhaps into the $215 million to $240 million after-tax range as we benefit from higher opt-in rates and product changes. And now I should mention, we are being very measured in our approach here: First, because we want to make sure that our customers understand all their options and can make an informed choice; and second, because our first priority in the East, at least, is to complete the integration. On the Credit Card Act, if you remember, that also went into effect the third quarter of last year, where we had a $30 million impact and a $50 million impact in the fourth quarter. That, of course, is now already in our run rate. We have a much smaller impact from this act for us than for all of our large peers who have much larger credit card businesses.", "On FDIC, we expect the FDIC quarterly expenses to increase by about $40 million after tax starting in the second quarter of 2011, since approximately 80% of our total funding is from core customer deposits, a real competitive advantage for us, the FDIC changes will have a much smaller impact on Wells Fargo than on those companies who are more wholesale or more market funded. Now on debit and interchange fees, as John mentioned, this topic is still being debated and we would suggest there's a wide range of potential outcomes, including, obviously, no impact if this regulation is not implemented. Based on the facts as we know currently, a place marker for this would be around $250 million-plus or minus per quarter initially, but I want to emphasize that this is just an approximation and is very, very, very preliminary. We believe there's still a lot of work to be done on this, so we will have to see where this goes, when it goes and indeed, if it goes into effect.", "Regulatory reform and its impact on the banks and its customers is still a work in progress. Through its direct impact on checking, debit and credit cards, reg reform will clearly place additional costs on the nation's payment system. Some of which will need to be borne in the form of higher fees by the consumers and businesses who benefit from the significant ongoing investment the banking industry makes in maintaining a viable payment system. We believe this is about revenue, though, not simply about fees, and gaining more business and more customers by having the right value proposition across all payment products will be one important part of our response. The second part of our response to reg reform will also be to step up our efforts to be cost competitive in the marketplace. So on Slide 14, let me describe some of the things you can expect on expenses.", "As I mentioned earlier, we had $533 million of Wachovia merger integration expenses in the fourth quarter. This expense will decline as the integration activities start to wind down in 2011, and there could be some small tailed into the first quarter of 2012. While credit quality continue to improve, we still have higher than normal costs associated with loan resolutions and loss mitigation, including both personnel and foreclosed asset expenses. We expect these expenses will decline moderately in 2011 and then perhaps more significantly. And we provided here again some range of potential expense levels for loan resolution and loss mitigation costs in both 2011 and 2012 compared with the $827 million of actual expense in the fourth quarter of 2010.", "In the third quarter of 2010, we closed the separate branch network for Wells Fargo Financial, by the way, a very good example of the economies of scale we can achieve with Wachovia, and we expect additional cost saves as the Wells Fargo Financial portfolio is reduced over time. As mentioned earlier, we had a $400 million charitable contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation in the fourth quarter, covering three years of estimated expenses and funding for the foundation. And our current view is that that will, of course, go to zero in the next two years as a result. As I mentioned, advertising, travel and equipment expenses in the fourth quarter were seasonally higher than average, than the average quarterly run rate, so that will be somewhat lower, all other things constant in 2011 and 2012 than the fourth quarter number that you see. And finally, as we've mentioned before, we are working on a company-wide expense initiative that's focused on process improvements, improving time-to-market, reducing complexity in our product lines and eliminating redundancies, and we'll provide much more comprehensive details on this by the middle of this year.", "Finally, on Slide 15. Our capital ratios continue to increase in the fourth quarter, driven by strong internal capital generation of $3.5 billion, up 12% annualized. Tier 1 common grew to 8.37%, up 36 basis points from the third quarter. That ratio is well above our average of 7% Tier 1 common from 2001 to 2007. Under the Basel capital proposals, we estimate our Tier 1 common capital ratio at 6.9% in the fourth quarter. Now as we wait to hear from our regulators on our capital plan submission, we remain eager to increase our dividend and hope to eventually, emphasize, eventually return to a more normalized payout ratio of at least 30% and to engage in repurchasing shares in step with continued capital growth.", "We also expect to redeem those trust-preferred securities that are callable and that would no longer be considered Tier 1 Capital under new regulations. While, of course, all of this is subject to regulatory approval, I would highlight that our capital is very strong. It's been growing steadily through industry-leading internal capital generation. Credit quality has clearly improved, and we have shed significant asset risk now from our balance sheet.", "So in summary, our fourth quarter continued to demonstrate the company's ability to earn strong and consistent earnings. Our results in the fourth quarter, in our view, were high quality, driven by broad-based revenue growth and significant improvement in credit quality, and our capital position is strong and continued to grow. With that, I'd like to now open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald - Bernstein Research", "Howard, question on just liquidity. If we look at your cash, your fed funds sold position, it's grown dramatically in the last year. It looks about $72 billion average in the fourth quarter. Just wondering why is it you seem to be sitting on so much cash and liquidity? And what will be the criteria for you to start putting some of that to work?", "Howard Atkins", "Well, John, we do have a lot of liquidity. And that's really the result of having such strong deposit growth. As I mentioned earlier, 7% checking account, savings account growth just in the fourth quarter. And as you know, our deposit growth has surpassed our loan growth in the last period of time. Obviously, we'd love to see more loan demand. We're beginning to some of that now. And we think that the cash that we have on the balance sheet positions us very well for when loan growth does materialize. And of course, should interest rates go up enough, we can consider adding more to the Bond portfolio which we've been reluctant to do in a significant way so far and just given what we think may be the very low level of long term interest rates that have been prevailing.", "John McDonald - Bernstein Research", "So you view this as offense? This isn't really defense of getting ready for new liquidity requirements or anything like that?", "John Stumpf", "Total offense, John.", "Howard Atkins", "Required to hold more liquidity. Simply, we've been incredibly successful in growing deposits. And as you know, we've always tried to do the right thing for our balance sheet and earnings. So this is just very offensive and positioning for the future.", "John McDonald - Bernstein Research", "Second question on expenses on the Page 14 Slide. First, why did the Wells Fargo Financial wind-down cost last for three years?", "Howard Atkins", "It's not the wind-down costs, it\u2019s the ongoing cost of keeping the portfolio going. There is a loan portfolio there, the debt consolidation portfolio. And as that portfolio matures over time, we'll be able to pull the cost down and further integrate into the existing retail system.", "John Stumpf", "But, John, the store costs are all out.", "John McDonald - Bernstein Research", "And on then on that slide, it seems from looking at that, that you could have some meaningful expense leverage in 2012. And the question I hear a lot and I'm sure you get is, will you let any of this fall to the bottom line or is there a long list of investment projects that this is going to get redirected to? And feel free answer that it'll be some of both.", "John Stumpf", "First of all, we are not underinvesting today. We think of this company as a growth company, we invest in growth opportunities, we opened stores this last year, we\u2019ve added tons of bankers, more feet on the street. So as we get to 2012, if we see some great investment opportunities that are incrementally above where we are today, we'll do that. Otherwise, this will flow to the bottom line. But we are not underinvesting today, and this is not to redirect someplace because we have to make an investment someplace.", "John McDonald - Bernstein Research", "Last thing on mortgage. I know you don't give out the number, but directionally, did the origination gain on sale margins come down materially in the fourth quarter, and can you give just some directional magnitude on that? And do you expect further contraction again in early 2011?", "Howard Atkins", "In terms of the spread on gain on sales? There wasn\u2019t an immaterial change in the quarter.", "John McDonald - Bernstein Research", "So volume really drove the change in...", "Howard Atkins", "As I said, you put aside the repurchase reserve provision, the origination fee and non-interest income, what was up roughly the same as the origination volume.", "John McDonald - Bernstein Research", "And could you comment at all on what your thoughts are going into this year on those margins holding up?", "Howard Atkins", "The industry is consolidated, so on average, margins are not going to change very much. But what will drive margins up and down is the level of interest rates and volume and the industries adding and subtracting capacity. So it really is going to be a function of demand overall.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "David Ho", "This is David Ho on behalf of Matt. Question on the Tier 1 common. It rose by 36 basis points in fourth quarter under Basel I. Curious to see why you didn\u2019t see an increase under Basel III?", "Howard Atkins", "Because of, again, some evolving definitional changes, number one. And number two, because we had some real growth in risk-weighted assets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "One is on capital management. And, Howard, you mentioned that you've got the dividend share buybacks reinvestment. Can you just prioritize how you're thinking about that? Does the 30% pay off come first and then everything else follows after that?", "Howard Atkins", "I think the point I'd try to make, Betsy, is that there are really three things that we're focused on right now. We want to start getting the dividend back up to a more normal payout ratio. We think that's important, appropriate and time to reward our shareholders in that fashion. Number two, share repurchase simultaneously is important in combination with the higher dividend. And clearly, we want to call the TRUPS, which has an immediate impact on both earnings and Tier 1 common and doesn't cost us anything from a capital perspective. So all three of those things are important and represent an important part of our capital management.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Because when you talked about doing the buybacks, you were talking about doing the buybacks in step with capital growth.", "Howard Atkins", "Here's sort of conceptual construct. As you know, a company that's growing capital at twice the rate of its asset growth can return a lot more than 30% of its capital back to its shareholders and still grow capital. So when we think about total return of capital to shareholders, it's really the combination of dividend and share repurchase that we're thinking about, and that number could be more than just the 30% dividend payout ratio.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And I was wondering how you think about what kind of capital you feel you need to run the business under Basel III? I realize that you put out the 6.9% in the discussion here on Page 15. And I'm just wondering, what are some of the major elements that differentiate the Basel I versus the Basel III? Can we get any detail on that? And how do you plan on managing that going forward? I'm just trying to understand what kind of excess capital level you have.", "Howard Atkins", "Let me try with you this way. First, as you know, historically, we've always run the company with very strong capital ratios. The 7% Tier 1 Common that we had prior to 2008 was at the top end of the industry and served us pretty well when we went to buy Wachovia. Our Tier 1 common today under Basel I is now 20% higher than that already strong capital ratio. On a Basel I basis, we already think the company is being operated at very, very strong capital levels. And of course, given our capital generation, well we'll see how high that goes. If that translates back to roughly a 7% Tier 1 common on the Basel III, that also feels about right to us. And that's before taking into account other things that the regulators may require. That appears to be about where the regulators are coming out now on Basel III. So 7% Basel III, 8 to 8.25 on Basel I for Tier 1 common feels like an appropriate kind of target for us going forward.", "John Stumpf", "Betsy, I\u2019d just add this. I have to agree with Howard. We talked about this a lot at this company. I think the part that Basel III got right was around calibrating the risk. And this company just runs with a lot less risk. If you look at how we fund our balance sheet, the level of core deposits, the kind of credit and other risks that we take in managing and so forth, running at about 7% Basel III kind of number give or take, it seems like that's strong capital.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "So the RWA\u2019s that you've got into Basel III is point in time what you have today or does that include mitigation?", "Howard Atkins", "No mitigation. We don't feel that mitigation is necessary because again, remember as John mentioned, we will have a much smaller impact from Basel III than the other banks because we don't have the same risk profile that other companies do. It's quite significant advantage for us and will not lead us to have to take mitigating actions from where we are, given how rapidly our capital\u2019s been growing.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And anything on the M&A front outside of the depository business?", "John Stumpf", "The biggest issue right now is finishing Wachovia. We've had operators look at things that could or could not be interesting. Like there's consolidation going on in the industry, but we simply want to -- we're over 2/3 through this. We want to really do this exceedingly well. I mentioned in the past we have an interest in growing our Insurance Distribution business, and we're doing a lot of things organically, but there are some opportunities if that industry consolidates and the wealth brokerage retirement business and Asset Management. Those are other areas that we have I think opportunities to play a larger role. In many cases, just serving our existing customers. So if there's things that are opportunistic, terrific. If there's things that are not opportunistic, we have so much to do organically, but, and you know this, the Wachovia thing really did change the reach of this company. It was such a wonderful merger and acquisition. It really gave us a lot of what we needed to play on the national stage in many of our businesses.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Right, and that\u2019s why I was wondering if there\u2019s any fill-ins in the non-depository businesses that you might have on a [indiscernible] (01:00:45)", "John Stumpf", "Sure. Like I said, some of the wealth and Asset Management businesses things and some in distribution, but there's not a big gaping hole in our product suite or menu that's problematic for us today. Either geography or product.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And then just last on the TRUPS, callable TRUPS. I'm looking at about $4.6 billion in callable TRUPS right now. Is that accurate or am I off on that number?", "Howard Atkins", "We have, as you know, about $21 billion in total. Some of that will convert by its terms to qualifying forms of preferred. And we have about $11 billion or $12 billion left that theoretically could be callable.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "If you were to pay up?", "Howard Atkins", "No, just callable.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "I guess as a follow-up to that last one. There's still a decent sized gap between net income and net income to common, so is working down preferred dividends an opportunity as well?", "Howard Atkins", "Well, again, to the extent that represents qualifying capital, we're not going to call stuff that represents qualifying capital.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "And then just more broadly on recapture, the USB kind of mentioned 50% as a guess for the overall recapture rate across all the regulatory stuff that's happening. And seemed to kind of indicate it will happen starting in 2011 versus 2012. If I put everything you're saying together, is that translating to rough [indiscernible] (01:02:39) ballpark or how should we think about overall recapture rates and timing?", "John Stumpf", "We've not given a number, Brian. And we are busy about changing some products, looking for ways to add value and get paid for that. But we've not -- for us, we don't even know what the debiting will be at. That's still in play. We're just not giving a number on that.", "Howard Atkins", "And frankly, it depends on what you call recapture because as we said before, some of this is going to be fee increases; some of it's going to become -- is going to be expense management; some of it is going to come from greater volume as we increase the value proposition through our customers. So again, I don't know how you do a math on that.", "John Stumpf", "We're trying to look at a balanced approach on a multidimensional approach. Different customers have different levels of profitability with us. We've not been sitting around here just hoping. We've been working very hard about strengthening our relationship model. In fact, the relationship model we employ here is probably the best thing, the best anecdote to what's happening in the regulatory reform arena because as we deepen relationships, profitability grows exponentially as we add products [indiscernible] (01:04:17). So I think it's a work in progress.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "Some of the stuff that's going to happen seems like, maybe annual fees on debit cards, maintenance fees on low balance accounts, stuff that's going to be not particularly popular with customers. So is it better to move with the industry on that or is it better to kind of wait and be the last one to do that and kind of gauge how customers move around and maybe pick up market share by still offering a free product?", "John Stumpf", "I think it\u2019s best to serve your customers and put their interest. They understand we have to get paid. Nobody can operate a business at a loss, and we're going to get paid differently, so it might not be an increase. And like Howard mentioned, we're also tightening our belt. And we're going to try to drive our costs down so we can be more competitive. So I think it's a -- I don't know that it's an early or later kind of thing. It's about serving customers and evolve. We\u2019re always evolving. In fact, if you look back, I've been in this industry 35 years, the way we got paid for checking account was very different 35 years ago than it was 20 years ago than it is today. So things change.", "Howard Atkins", "And again, not to make too fond a point about it as we said, this is about the customer and the revenue we earn from the customer, not about the fee.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Question on the loan growth. The C&I increase is very encouraging this quarter. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the drivers to that. Was it actual increase in line utilization rates? Was it more on new clients? And what about generally your expectations as we head into the first half of '11 here?", "John Stumpf", "Joe, it's more on new clients and not on -- utilization rates really have not changed. That still is dry powder, but we are out winning more relationships, and it's more in that area.", "Howard Atkins", "Joe, as you know, from public data, there has been an increase in total loans in the system in the last quarter or two. But as I pointed out on the market share tables, we've increased market share. That tells you that we've been picking up relationships during this period.", "John Stumpf", "But we are hearing more comments from our customers that where a year ago, you didn't hear about, as much about, I'm thinking of adding a plant or adding some people or doing this or whatever. You're hearing more of that today. But typically what happens is you see some rundown in deposit balances, then you see the borrowing.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And then just a couple of quick questions on the mortgage repurchased stuff. I guess, first, have you explored at all a possible settlement with the GSE, some of the outstanding pipeline of claims or have they approached you at all? And then also the provision for losses, while overall still low, was up from the last several quarters. You talked about increased severity. Is that primarily on the private label side or across the board? And any other comments you could share there would be helpful.", "Howard Atkins", "The loss severity is just our estimate based on what we're seeing in both portfolios. As we've indicated, the larger of the two issues for us is still the agency side of it. We've had virtually nothing on the private side. And as far as global settlement, again, as we said before, this is a rapidly declining issue for us, and we think we're very well reserved. So I'm not sure a settlement would make a lot of sense.", "John Stumpf", "Joe, I think of it in these terms. This is a very issuer or company specific kind of thing. And you've got to look at what's going on, what you have in the portfolio. Percentage is prime, percentage is current and all of that. So because it might make sense for one company, again, very unique by company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Now that you became more of a national franchise, is there any one area where you're seeing more economic growth, or more loan demand or more positive comments than -- is it the South, or is it California?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, sure. We see things are different. Texas tends to be -- our business there is doing quite well. So I think it depends on where the states are or the areas of the country that are into certain economies. Where you have a housing basis for the economy, that's more difficult. Or there's energy or agriculture it tends to be a little better. So it reflects that. But I would say the general mood is and the general feeling is that while it's tepid so far, there is a recovery in place. Things are better than they were a year ago. Not as good as they need to be, not as good as they will be, hopefully, and jobs are still the big issue, but it's surely, there's a little more spring in the step of our customer, business and consumer.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And then on the deposits side, a lot of -- you're the best deposit base out there, but is it the case, though your liquidity is really building up, are you starting to push out some non-core deposits or just trying to maybe not be such a good deposit gather in this market? Because eventually this stuff will move out.", "Howard Atkins", "Remember, the deposits that we're talking about here, that we've been gathering are checking accounts and savings accounts. They're not CDs and time deposits. So in effect, the way we've been thinking about in pricing CDs is not to take the higher cost money and just continue to get the growth in customer operating balances is really what this is all about. And what that really says is, we've been successful at growing the number of customers who are doing business with us and getting more of their operating balances and not that we\u2019re pricing to get more time deposits.", "John Stumpf", "Paul, we are really focused in this company on checking account, what I would call transactional deposit growth because what that means is you're winning households. It's one of my favorite things to do every morning when I get here is read the deposit report from the day before because when you're growing checking accounts, you're growing households. And the checking account and the mortgage, frankly, are about two of the biggest books you can get. And when we see -- Florida last year, we grew checking accounts by 10%. We all know Florida did not grow households by 10%. They might have had \u2013 might have been even or maybe an outflow last year. So we are gaining share. And the same thing is true in New Jersey and even in California here. We grew by over 8%. And while those deposits might not be that valuable today, because we're going to invest them, let me tell you that is our lifeblood. We are going to like those and those relationships a lot. We like them a lot today. We're going to like them even more in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "I just want to maybe follow-up a little bit on John's initial question about how much liquidity you have on the balance sheet. There was a line in your third quarter 10-Q that talked about being able to, at some point, invest a lot of excess liquidity into investment securities. And I'm sort of wondering what your thoughts are in terms of how you would invest that and what kind of thresholds we would need to see from an interest rate standpoint for you to think about investing more aggressively in terms of some of that excess liquidity? And then I also have a follow-up question.", "Howard Atkins", "Well, the best way we can invest that liquidity is that we get loan growth, right? And we think we are particularly well leveraged for loan growth. We gave you the data on loan outstanding increases, but I should also mention that while loans have not gone up significantly, we have been very active in growing the number of new lines and committed facilities. So once loan demand actually comes back, it could come back pretty quickly here for us. In terms of the Investment portfolio, we've been saying for many quarters now that we've been keeping our powder dry. We did do some investing in the fourth quarter when rates started moving up and we actually, as I mentioned, sold some of the lowest yielding securities we've had in the portfolio and repositioned that up into the higher yields that were prevailing at the end of the quarter. I can also tell you, Ed, that if you look back historically at securities that we bought for the portfolio, typically, that has been mortgage-backed securities, just plain manila agency mortgage-backed securities which we think is good for our portfolio given the long duration of our liabilities. And secondly, we typically in the past have not bought securities of that kind unless rates were up in the sort of 5%-ish level or higher. Now that's a yield level that may have been more relevant for the past than for the future, so I'm not suggesting necessarily that that's the right benchmark going forward. But throughout most of 2010, at least, mortgage-backed security yields just felt awfully low to us relative to both history and relative to earnings that were coming through for us in the Mortgage business.", "Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "I tell you we should think about you not being too aggressive in terms of growing the MBS portfolio unless we see a material additional pickup in rates.", "Howard Atkins", "Yes, and again that could change because the one thing that could change that thought a little bit is, we do have to look at the total balance sheet and we don't want to have our liability durations moving too far, too fast away from our asset duration. So we are trying to keep a relatively balanced balance sheet. But all of those things aside, yes, we prefer seeing higher yields before beginning to load up on the portfolio.", "John Stumpf", "But, Ed, you're asking the right question because there's a lot of earnings power there. There's a lot of -- when you look at the spread we're getting on those excess dollars today, it's minimal, so there's a real opportunity.", "Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "And then just a follow-up question. It has to do with mortgage servicing income and sort of the rate positioning of your Servicing portfolio. Prior to the third quarter, we went through a number of quarters where you were getting market related MSR valuation gains net of the hedge as rates were falling. In the third and fourth quarter, that didn't happen. In fact, there was, it looked like, a net loss this quarter, and I'm looking at the table on the top of Page 43. And I'm just wondering, you've always traditionally talked about how the Servicing portfolio was a natural offset to the origination side of the business. And I'm just wondering if you are adopting sort of a view that rates will rise over time. And in that sense, are you thinking about sort of not completely hedging the servicing portfolio so that if rates do rise, we could get some net gains in terms of the valuation of the servicing portfolio net of the hedge? Or do you just want to keep it as well hedged as possible and not really think about that as a source of potential revenue?", "Howard Atkins", "A lot of things in the response to that question. First of all, we're not necessarily operating with a view that rates have to go up, but we at least want to make sure that we're properly protected in case that they do. As far as the hedge is concerned, the actual head result in the quarter was really close to zero as I mentioned in my remarks because the reported numbers included the additional costs for servicing a foreclosure expense that went through the MSR in the quarter. So you take that away and we're really at zero. And the third point I'd make in terms of the size of the hedge and the composition of the hedge, obviously, that's changing all the time. And as a function of yield curves and rate levels and spreads between mortgage assets and treasuries and LIBOR and so on, so there's really no singular answer to that question. But yes, following your thought to the extent that we felt that higher interest rates were more likely than lower interest rates, we might actually reduce the size of the hedge, and therefore, benefit by a greater up valuation of the asset relative to cost of the hedge should rates go up. Again, I'm not saying that that's where we are, but theoretically, that could happen in that circumstance.", "John Stumpf", "And another piece that gets involved in that analysis, Ed, is what's the carry on the hedge. So if you're doing really well on the carry, you might want to be more matched versus -- this is something that we go through every Monday morning. It gets lots of management attention around here, but Howard's right, if we\u2019re convinced that there's a high probability that rates are going to go up, in the past, we\u2019ve  placed strategy maybe in less hedged in that -- that's always on the table.", "Edward Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Not to sort of belabor the point, but I guess it seems very likely that origination revenue will decline from third and fourth quarter levels. So I guess more to the point, should we think about probably mortgage banking revenue going down or do you think there's an offset available in the Servicing portfolio revenue if origination volume does drop?", "Howard Atkins", "You are touching on the point as to why we think of the mortgage business as being a balanced business between servicing and origination, so that when we do our simulations and everything in terms of what impact interest rates may have on the business holistically, we look at both sides of the business and take into account effects on both sides of the business and the way we manage it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "The FHFA proposed earlier this week to cut the servicing fee for the GSEs, and I was curious as to your thoughts in terms of the impacts of that on Wells Fargo and what you guys think of that proposal?", "John Stumpf", "Fred, conditions over the past few years have caused many both in the industry and policy positions to rethink servicing contracts and what\u2019s going on there. And any changes likely -- if there are changes, they'd be perspective in nature. And in spite more than a year or so, whatever will be decided, it's probably too early to give you any view on impact. But let me just say this, it's probably -- it could be neutral to us because we're both in the Origination business and the Servicing business. So if you allocate less of what the customer pays, allocate less of that to capitalized servicing asset, you\u2019d probably get more than on your gain on sale. And there are pluses and minuses in having a smaller servicing asset. You can hedge less. So I'm not \u2013 so I think what I'm suggesting is, it's still in the very early stages. It's still being discussed. It\u2019s probably going to be prospective, if anything, on new volume, and I'm not sure if this is more about geography and less about economics.", "Howard Atkins", "I think essentially, what this really means is, that if it happens, as John says, less of the gain on sale when you sell a mortgage is attributable to the servicing asset, and more of the gain on sale just comes through us an origination gain in cash. One interesting potential benefit, if you will, if this happens, again, as John mentioned, is that the -- simply the amount of capitalized servicing on the balance sheet will be less over time, and that has some positive implications, if you will, on the Basel III, which caps the amount of capitalized servicing that can be counted as Tier 1 common. So there are some interesting benefits from that if that happens without really changing the economics of the business.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I just kind of viewed it as probably a positive for you and that gain on sales determine the market place wouldn't change much. More gain on sale would be cash, and your servicing asset would be smaller, freeing up some capital while the actual reported income probably wouldn't change much. Is that kind of a fair characterization of thinking about -- obviously as was stated it would play itself out over an extended period of time?", "Howard Atkins", "I think that's a short and sweet way of thinking about it. Yes.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "One other quick question, Howard. In terms of interpreting the Fed's policy in terms of dividends, obviously , you all are going through a stress test and have to get that all buttoned up. Secondly, they did discuss Basel III kind of reaching that 7% level. Should we interpret the Fed's statement as saying before you kind of increase dividends, you have to be at that 7% Basel III level or simply just have to have a plan kind of to get there in the near term?", "Howard Atkins", "I think the best way I could answer that is to say that Basel III is still evolving. I don't know whether there will be a soft or a hard or any kind of requirement for 7% on the Basel III. But as you know, if there is one, we're already there. So in our case, it doesn't really matter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ron Mandle with GIC.", "Ron Mandle - GIC", "In regard to capital, the 6.9% Basel III of last quarter, the Basel III ratio went up more than the Basel I ratio and you referred to deferred tax assets and using the PCI and so on. So assuming this is just the flatness of this quarter versus last quarter, as you said, it's just definitional, does that mean that if Basel I ratio continues to go up in the next few quarters, that the Basel III ratio should again go up faster than the Basel I ratio?", "Howard Atkins", "You can't simply do the transfer. It's not a fixed spread between the two ratios, Ron. Some quarters, the spread between the two may go up, some may go down. I gave you some factors before. You got the MSR calculation in there. You got DTA so on and so forth. So again, it's really just not a fixed spread between the two. And in this particular quarter, we had real growth in those assets that impact the Basel III ratio.", "Ron Mandle - GIC", "Going forward, we should expect more of a lock step than we saw this quarter? Should we think of it that way?", "Howard Atkins", "No, as I said, because of these other definitional factors for the Tier 1 common, I am not prepared to say that the spread between the two ratios are going to be fixed and therefore may or may not go up and down. Generally speaking, the two ratios should move in the same direction and simply because the overriding driver of both is internal capital generation, it's earnings. So yes in that sense, they both should move in the same direction and roughly by the same amount but plus or minuses, the tweaks that come along with Basel III.", "Ron Mandle - GIC", "And then my other question is in regard to Durban[ph] (01:26:50) . You referred to $250 million quarterly charge. One question was whether that's pretax or after-tax?", "Howard Atkins", "That would be after-tax. Again, I don't want to put too much precision on that, Ron, because again, that's such an approximated figure at this point and so preliminary. But we put that out there as kind of a place mark.", "Ron Mandle - GIC", "You mentioned a couple of times in discussing it that whether -- as to if it would be implemented at all. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on that point. It's not clear to me anyway under what scenarios it might not be implemented at all. So if you could elaborate, I'd appreciate it.", "John Stumpf", "Let me just give you a broader response to that. I'm not in favor of government price controls as part of a market-based economy that we have. I just think that's bad as an initial thing, as an overall statement. We need free enterprise and government debt. What product is next, what industry comes next? I've not seen that work in the past very well. With respect to the issue, specifically, it's in the interest, the long term interest of merchants and consumers and the [indiscernible] (01:28:18) service industry that we get this right. And right now it's on a fast track. We've got to make sure it gets on the right track where the people who develop these products, the banks and so forth, this is a big fixed cost business, and I don't know of any industry or business that can seem to grow, innovate, support a product where you don't get paid for it. And you get paid on a variable rate basis when you have all these fixed cost. And there's real value being created here. Debit cards largely have transplanted cash and check. This is good for merchants, the cost of handling that cash, the checks taking the risk. Getting immediate funds with debit is enormously valuable. And that value creation helps them, and we need to get compensated. And I don't understand why cost became the issue. But anyway, I think there is good reason and an opportunity for us to sit around and get on the table and make sure we come up with the right situation. In fact, the President even asked a couple of days ago that you look at these regulations. He didn't say this one but he said regulations in general. And I think this is a great example of something that we simply have got to get right because at the end of the day, if we can't get paid this way, we\u2019ve got to get paid a different way. And we want to make absolutely sure that customers don't get disadvantaged in this process.", "Ron Mandle - GIC", "John, I understand what you're saying completely, but it seems to me that that is implementing the law as it currently stands. So unless the law itself changes, I don't see how we go to the environment that you're describing from where we are now.", "John Stumpf", "Well, we will be prepared for whatever outcome, but we're going to make the point as an industry that, in this case, we need to really understand what we're doing here.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Adam Barkstrom with Sterne Agee.", "Adam Barkstrom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Not to pound you guys on the dividend question, but just at some point, obviously, you guys are going to be given the green light to increase dividend. And I'm just curious from your perspective, do you think that's going -- let's just say 30% payout as kind of the boogie. I mean would you envision kind of jumping up to the 30% or kind of gradually working your way through to that number? Then have I have one follow-up.", "Howard Atkins", "No, really can't talk about the specific submission to the Fed or let alone what the Fed may or may not approve. So a lot of this is really going to be up to the Fed.", "Adam Barkstrom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Just assuming hypothetically that 30%, give or take as kind of the number, would you envision getting to that number very quickly or kind of more in a gradual process?", "Howard Atkins", "As I said, restoring a more normal dividend, buying back shares, calling the TRUPS and continuing to generate more capital are all important things to us. But at this point, really the best way I can answer the question is, it's up to the regulators at this point.", "Adam Barkstrom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "And then, Howard, one last follow-up. Any further color you could give us kind of on margin from here? You mentioned in your opening remarks that you guys sold some of your Bond portfolio, the lowest yield stuff. You've certainly been the -- have benefited from some nice loan growth this quarter. Should we expect kind of looking out, maybe a gradual turn in the margin from here?", "Howard Atkins", "The margin really is a result of many things that occur on the balance sheet and in our earnings. And what we\u2019re trying to do is grow net interest income and revenue, and the margin will be what the margin will be. To the extent that we have continued success in growing, checking and savings, that'll increase the margin. Frankly, if loan demand accelerates, that will be great for the top line, but it may actually reduce the margin if we're not growing deposits at the same fast rate. So lots of things can happen to the margin here which, as I say, are just the result of many, many, many other things that we're trying to do.", "John Stumpf", "We're going to wrap right now. Sorry, it went a little over time, but we appreciate your interest in the company and your questions. Thank you for joining us, and we will do this again 90 days from now.

Inc.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (NYSE:USA) Inc.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Celeste, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Wells Fargo First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn today's call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Celeste, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and CFO, Tim Sloan, will review first quarter results and answer your questions. ", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call, and that those forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today and the earnings release and quarterly supplement included as exhibits. ", "In addition, some of the discussion today about the company's performance will include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can be found in our SEC filings and in the earnings release and quarterly supplement available on our website at wellsfargo.com. ", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, and thanks for joining the call and your interest in Wells Fargo. We're extremely pleased with the performance of the company in the first quarter with record earnings of $3.8 billion, up 48% from a year ago. Each of our business segments contributed to the overall profitability and the value of our diversified model was never more evident. ", "We generated broad-base growth across our business segments, including revenue growth in businesses as diverse as commercial and corporate banking, investment banking, commercial real estate, international banking, wealth management, brokerage, auto dealer services, merchant and payroll services. We also achieved significant improvement in credit quality during the quarter, and here, too, our improvement was broad based across our portfolios. These strong business results enabled us to continue to grow capital internally, producing an estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under current Basel III capital proposals of 7.2%. ", "We're extremely pleased that we're able to reward our loyal shareholders by increasing our quarterly dividend rate, by reinstating our stock repurchase program and by calling $3.2 billion in Trust Preferred Securities. And as we just announced today, our board authorized a second quarter dividend of $0.12 per share. ", "As I have said many times, our merger with Wachovia is exceeding our own high expectations and has created, in our view, the most powerful platform in the industry. We completed the conversion of banking stores in Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware and New York in the first quarter. And late last week, we completed the Pennsylvania integration. Including Pennsylvania, 74% of our banking customers are now on a single system. We've had positive customer response to the new store design and enhanced product offering while continuing to provide the same focus on providing excellent customer service. ", "We are successfully meeting the financial needs of our customers throughout the East as evidenced by our cross sell, now reaching 5.22 products per household, up from 5.02 just a year ago. Checking accounts in North Carolina grew by 8.5% and in Florida by 12%. Sales of credit cards more than doubled in the East from a year ago. This success will help drive revenue growth for years to come as we continue to deepen the relationships of our existing customers and grow market share. ", "The steady progress in consolidating our company across the nation is coming at a time of transition for our industry. Two changes that have been top of mind for investors are the fate of debit interchange revenue as part of Dodd-Frank and the recent regulatory and legal actions related to the mortgage servicing and foreclosures. ", "Regarding debit interchange, we believe lawmakers should take the necessary time to better understand the direct and indirect consequences of the proposed reduction in debit interchange fees on consumers, merchants and banks. Banks should be fairly compensated for the value that debit cards provide for merchants and the convenience they offer consumers. Government price controls that wouldn't even enable banks to cover the cost of providing the service make no sense, particularly for consumers. We are hopeful that congress will do the right thing, which is to delay the scheduled implementation until these issues are addressed. ", "As you are aware, federal banking regulators recently issued consent orders regarding foreclosure policies and practices. We take this issue seriously and are committed to complying with those orders. In addition, Wells Fargo supports the idea of national servicing standards suggested by the regulators, which we hope will provide greater clarity for customers, servicers and investors. ", "We are not perfect, but Wells Fargo has been and always will be committed to doing the right thing for our customers and our country. We remain dedicated to helping our at-risk customers as evidenced by our over 665,000 active trial and completed modifications we've done since the beginning of 2009. ", "Our outreach efforts continue to grow as we have now conducted 22 of our home preservation workshops across the country, and we plan to hold twice as many this year as we did last year. We have met with over 20,000 customers face-to-face at these events, and this effort has helped us complete almost twice as many modifications for customers as foreclosures since 2009. ", "We have been working with our regulators for an extended period on improving our servicing practices, and we\u2019ve already begun instituting meaningful changes to our processes. Last summer, we adopted a single point-of-contact strategy to help customers seeking loan modifications. In the fourth quarter, we established a uniform foreclosure affidavit for each judicial state subject to local rules. So we have already started making some of the operational changes and incurring some of the costs that will result from the expanded servicing responsibilities outlined in the consent order. ", "While we continue to focus on helping our customers, our first quarter results demonstrate that we are off to a great start in 2011. The rest of the year holds additional opportunities as we work to convert the remaining Wachovia banking stores in the East, focus on improving our efficiency, invest our liquid assets wisely and continue to lend to our commercial and consumer customers. At the same time, we continue to reduce our exposure to higher risk portfolios, benefit from improved credit quality and build capital internally. ", "Now let me turn this over to our CFO, Tim Sloan.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the slide presentation included in the quarterly supplement available on the Investor Relations section of the Wells Fargo website. ", "As you have seen from our press release today, we had a very strong quarter. Our record earnings were driven by continued improvement in credit quality, higher sales and deposit growth and lower expenses. These results generated strong returns with our return on asset increasing to 1.23%, the highest in three years, and our ROE, up 103 basis points from the fourth quarter to 11.98%. Liquidity remained very strong, including cash and fed funds' balances, up $13.3 billion from the fourth quarter. And we ended the quarter with our capital ratios at record highs, including our 7.2% Tier 1 common ratio estimate under current Basel III capital proposals. I'm going to highlight the drivers behind these strong results on the call today. ", "Moving to Slide 3. Our first quarter EPS was $0.67, our highest quarterly EPS since the merger. This ties our previous record of $0.67 in the second quarter of 2007 when we had approximately 40% fewer diluted shares outstanding. Revenue in the first quarter of $20.3 billion was down $1.2 billion from the fourth quarter primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue and lower net interest income. The decline in net interest income reflects 2 fewer days in the quarter and an 11-basis-point decline in the margin. Approximately half of the margin decline was due to a lower level of accelerated income from PCI loan resolutions and securities redemptions, predominantly related to the legacy Wachovia positions, both of which tend to be uneven. The remaining portion of the decline in margin was related to higher levels of lower-yielding cash and short-term investments, which reflects our disciplined interest rate management. ", "Our cash and short-term investments averaged $101 billion and earned a yield of 29 basis points in the first quarter. When thinking about the margin in an improving credit cycle, we believe it is useful to look at risk adjusted NIM. Ours has improved for 4 straight quarters, ending the first quarter at 2.85%, up 10 basis points from the fourth quarter and 60 basis points from a year ago. ", "There were a number of selected items in the first quarter that I'd like to highlight as shown on Slide 4. Merger integration expenses totaled $440 million in the quarter, down $94 million from the fourth quarter and consistent with our prior estimate for 2011 costs. Operating losses were $472 million in the quarter, substantially all from additional litigation accruals for foreclosure-related matters. Incentive compensation and employee benefits, which are seasonally higher in the first quarter, were up $352 million from the fourth quarter. Reflecting continued improvement and credit quality across our consumer and commercial portfolios, we released $1 billion in reserves in the first quarter and would expect additional releases in the future absent significant deterioration in the economy. Finally, our effective tax rate was 29.5% in the quarter, which included the benefit associated with the realization for tax purposes of a previously written-down investment. Currently, our estimated full year 2011 effective tax rate is approximately 32%. ", "Let me now turn to key growth drivers across our diversified model. On Slide 5, you can see that average loans increased $402 million from the fourth quarter driven by commercial loans, which grew for the second consecutive quarter and increased 4% linked quarter annualized. Growth in this portfolio was broad based, including growth in commercial and corporate banking, asset-backed finance, commercial real estate, SBA lending and in international. This growth reflected loans to new customers as well as increased line utilization, both positive signs of continued growth. ", "Average consumer loans declined from the fourth quarter, although the rate of decline has slowed for the past 4 quarters. There was growth in brokerage, private student lending and in auto. Auto dealer services had record originations in the first quarter with average loans up 14% linked quarter annualized. This strong volume enabled us to increase our margins in this business while we continue to benefit from lower charge-offs in delinquencies. ", "While average loans increased slightly from the fourth quarter, period-end loans declined $6.1 billion, reflecting the expected runoff in our nonstrategic portfolios, which declined $6.5 billion in the quarter. We are no longer originating these loans, including legacy Wells Fargo Financial indirect auto, liquidating home equity, legacy Wells Fargo financial debt consolidation, government student loans, Pick-a-Pay mortgages and other PCI loans. Other than these portfolios, our core loan portfolios grew $371 million from the fourth quarter. ", "As you can see on Slide 7, deposit growth was strong again this quarter with average core deposits up $37.7 billion or 5% from a year ago and up modestly from the fourth quarter. Average core deposits were 106% of average loans. Retail core deposits, which exclude wholesale banking and mortgage escrows, had stronger growth, up 7% annualized from the fourth quarter. ", "For the first time since the merger with Wachovia, retail core deposits grew in the Eastern markets as deposit balances are no longer facing the headwinds from the intentional runoff of $117 billion in high-rate Wachovia CDs that have matured over the past 2 years. At the time of the merger, approximately 41% of our retail core deposits in the Eastern markets were in CDs compared with only 17% at the end of the first quarter. These high rate CDs now account for only 2% of our total core deposits. ", "Average checking and savings deposits were $723 billion, up 9% from a year ago and were 91% of average core deposits, up from 88% a year ago. We continue to see strong account growth across our franchise with net retail checking account growth of 7.4%, including 7.9% growth in California, 8.5% growth in North Carolina and 12% growth in Florida. Our ability to generate such strong growth in states throughout our footprint reflects our unrelenting focus on providing industry-leading distribution, convenience and customer service, which benefits our current customers and attracts new customers. Our continued strength in attracting low-cost deposits is reflected in our overall low deposit funding costs of 30 basis points in the first quarter. ", "Turning to noninterest income on Slide 8. The $753 million linked quarter decline in noninterest income in the quarter was almost entirely due to a $741 million decrease in mortgage banking fees. Mortgage fees reflected a $44 billion decline in origination volume in the quarter as higher mortgage rates reduced refi volume. These higher rates also increased the value of our servicing portfolio, with net MSR results of $379 million and the ratio of MSRs to loan service for others at 92 basis points. MSR valuation adjustments included a reduction of $214 million in the first quarter for higher projected servicing and foreclosure costs. It is important to note that factoring in servicing and foreclosure costs in our MSR value is not new for Wells Fargo. In fact, we reduced the value of our MSR by over $1 billion in 2009 and by over $1 billion in 2010 as servicing and foreclosure costs rose. ", "Let me highlight a few other key drivers of fee income this quarter. Service charges on deposit accounts were down 2% linked quarter, due to seasonality, and down 24% from a year ago, due to the impact of Regulation E. The Reg E impact this quarter, along with the estimated 2011 impact from regulatory reform, is in line with estimates we provided last quarter. We continue to refine our estimate of lower debit interchange fees from Dodd-Frank, if implemented, which we now estimate will be approximately $325 million quarterly after-tax but before any offsets. This estimate also reflects the higher debit card transaction volume our consumer and small business customers are generating. ", "Card fees were up 2% from the fourth quarter, which is strong considering the usual seasonality in first quarter results. Year-over-year card fees were up 11% reflecting an 11% increase in debit card volume and a 6% increase in consumer credit card volume driven by new account growth and increased card usage by our existing customers. Trading gains were up 15% from the fourth quarter and 14% from a year ago, reflecting strong sales and trading volume driven primarily by interest rates and commodities trading activity on behalf of our customers. ", "On Slide 9, you'll see that expenses improved in the quarter, down $607 million from the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, expenses in the first quarter included $440 million of merger integration costs, higher operating losses related to a build in our litigation reserves and seasonally higher incentive compensation and employee benefit expenses. We also continued to have higher loan resolution and loss mitigation costs of $792 million this quarter. The lower expenses we had in the first quarter does not yet reflect the benefits we expect to realize from Project Compass, our company-wide effort to reduce core expenses while not compromising future growth opportunities. While Compass is focused on reducing our core fixed cost, our total expenses in any given quarter will depend on many factors, including the variable costs associated with many of our businesses, including residential mortgage originations. ", "Residential mortgage origination is one of the largest variable cost businesses at Wells Fargo, and it is important to consider the impact of expenses, not just revenue, on the bottom line. To manage this variable cost effectively, we utilize a temporary workforce for a portion of our origination activities that we can expand or contract depending on current and expected origination and application volume. In order to ensure a strong customer service and preparedness for rate volatility, we manage these costs carefully, and increases and decreases can lead or lag actual volume. As the graph on Slide 10 indicates, we ramped up production to support demand from the refi boom in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Now we are in the process of resizing the organization to reflect current demand levels as well as -- as we always do in mortgage cycles. This is not new for us. ", "Importantly, expenses can lag changes in volume since we need to provide notice to temporary staff before the end of their assignments with us. As mortgage volumes slowed in the first quarter, we took actions to reduce retail fulfillment staff by over 4,500 people. However, at the end of the quarter, over 2,000 were still on the payroll due to the required notification period. We expect to realize the expense savings from these reductions in the second quarter. ", "Turning to our segments, which starts on Slide 11. Community Banking earned $2.2 billion, up 13% from the fourth quarter, with $12.6 billion in revenue. We continued to sell more products to more customers across our banking footprint, achieving a record combined cross sell of 5.79 products in the first quarter, up from 5.6 a year ago. This growth reflects continued increases in the West with cross-sell reaching a record 6.21 products while the East grew cross-sell from 5.02 a year ago to 5.22 this quarter. Cross-sell improvement reflects record sales, with core product sales up 16% in the West reaching 3 million sales in a single month for the first time ever. ", "We also continued to increase sales in the East by introducing new sales and service practices as well as new products. Let me highlight a few examples. Approximately 33% of households in the West have a Wells Fargo credit card compared with less than 14% in the East. In the first quarter, credit card sales in the East more than doubled from a year ago. In the first quarter, partner referrals in the East that resulted in the sale, including products such as insurance, mortgage and merchant services, were more than 6x a year ago. ", "Wholesale Banking earned $1.7 billion on $5.5 billion in revenues in the first quarter. Loans grew 9% linked quarter annualized with broad-based growth in commercial banking, international, commercial real estate, asset-backed finance, government banking and corporate banking. Loan growth was driven by new customer activity and an increase in line utilization, up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter. ", "Linked quarter revenue was down primarily due to lower loan resolution income in the Wachovia portfolio. This decline was expected since we have already recognized the benefits from the largest loans in that portfolio. Many businesses within Wholesale Banking grew revenue linked quarter by adding new customers and continuing to focus on cross-selling. These included fixed-income sales and trading, equity sales and trading, investment solution, commercial mortgage servicing, equipment finance and real estate capital markets. ", "Let me give you a couple of quick examples of the momentum building in the first quarter. Commercial mortgage servicing won 6 master servicing deals in the first quarter compared with 13 for all of 2010. Wells Fargo Capital Finance arranged and syndicated the largest transaction in their history with a $1.8 billion refinancing for Hertz. Investment banking revenue with corporate and commercial customers increased 68% from the first quarter last year due to attractive capital markets conditions and continued success in selling investment banking products to our wholesale customer base. ", "Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement had a very strong quarter, earning $339 million, up $142 million from the fourth quarter. Revenue was $3.2 billion, up 4% from the fourth quarter. Revenue growth was driven by strong asset base fees with managed account assets up 7%. This growth benefited from the strongest quarterly net client asset flow since the merger. Expenses were down 2% from the fourth quarter resulting in positive operating leverage. Average core deposits were a record $125 billion, up $4 billion from the fourth quarter. ", "WBR results are already benefiting from the systems conversion completed early in the first quarter. Over 15,000 financial advisors in all 50 states are now on one common platform. Loan originations by financial advisors are up 56% from the first quarter 2010. Cross-sell continued to improve to 9.82 products per WBR customer, up from 9.67 products a year ago. ", "Our results this quarter continued to benefit from significant improvement in credit quality as shown on Slide 14. Charge-offs declined again for the fifth consecutive quarter, down $629 million from the fourth quarter and 41% below the fourth quarter 2009 peak. Nonperforming loans declined for the second consecutive quarter, down $1.3 billion from last quarter. Provision expense was $2.2 billion, down $779 million from the fourth quarter, including $1 billion reserve release. ", "Absent a significant deterioration in the economy, we believe future reductions in the allowance -- we can expect future reductions in the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for credit losses was $22.4 billion at the end of the quarter, and we also have $12.9 billion of nonaccretable difference to absorb losses in our PCI portfolio with the nonaccretable difference equal to 29.6% of remaining PCI unpaid principal balance. ", "The key credit metrics highlighted on Slide 15 point to continued improvement. NPAs were down 5% from the fourth quarter, our second straight quarterly decline. Nonperforming loans declined $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter with reductions in commercial and industrial, commercial real estate construction and each of the consumer loan categories. Total nonperforming inflows were down 11% from the fourth quarter. This is a second consecutive quarter of reduced inflows, which is a key driver of our NPA improvement. ", "We had the fifth consecutive quarterly decline in loans 90 days past due and still accruing, and early stage delinquencies also declined from the fourth quarter, the second consecutive quarter of improvement. This improvement in credit quality, in part, reflects the ongoing balance decline in nonstrategic portfolios, down a total of $64 billion or 34% since the merger with Wachovia. ", "The PCI portfolio continued to perform better than expected. Due to improved expected cash flows in this portfolio, largely Pick-a-Pay and resolved commercial loans, we have released a total of $5.5 billion of nonaccretable difference, $1.5 billion of which has been recognized in earnings since the merger from loan resolutions and most of the other $4 billion will be recognized through accretable yield over the life of the loans. This benefit has been partially offset by reserve bills netting to $3.9 billion improvement over original expectations. While the nonaccretable balance has absorbed $28 billion of losses related to PCI loans, we have $12.9 billion of nonaccretable difference remaining to cover 29.6% of remaining PCI unpaid principal balance. As we said at the time of the merger, we wanted to ensure that our portfolio marks were accurate, and we are pleased with the performance so far. ", "As we have done over the last few quarters, we updated the information on our mortgage servicing portfolio as well as our repurchase demands on Slide 17. The delinquency and foreclosure rate continued to decline to 7.22% in the first quarter, the lowest in 2 years and down significantly from a peak of 8.96% in fourth quarter 2009. Once again, based on the most recent publicly available data as of 12/31, our rate was the lowest among large bank peers. We believe these results reflect the relative strength of the Wells Fargo portfolio and the sustained improvement in the industry. ", "Our outstanding agency repurchase demands declined for the third consecutive quarter with the number and dollar volume of demands outstandings down over 50% from the second quarter 2010 peak. The most problematic vintages in terms of losses continue to be 2006 through 2008, but new demands in those vintages have dropped significantly from a year ago. New non-agency repurchase demands based on loan count have declined for 4 consecutive quarters, and we only had $69 million in total non-agency repurchases in the first quarter. ", "Total repurchased losses declined substantially in the first quarter to $331 million, down $175 million or 35% from the fourth quarter as repurchase volume declined. We added $249 million to the repurchase reserve this quarter, down $464 million in the fourth quarter. ", "As John spoke earlier on the call when he addressed the regulatory consent orders and as highlighted on Slide 18, we have already made many improvements to our servicing and foreclosure practices. As we have responded to changes in the housing market and strengthened our servicing practices, we have added over 10,000 team members to our home preservation staff, bringing the total to 16,000 team members. We plan to add or reassign approximately 1,000 additional team members over the next year with much of these costs already reflected in our current MSR value. ", "As we disclosed in last quarter's release, estimating the expenses we will incur to service our portfolio is a routine part of our quarterly MSR valuation process. We reduced the value of our MSR asset by $214 million this quarter due to increased servicing cost and have reduced the asset value by over $1 billion in each of the past 2 years as servicing and foreclosure costs have risen. ", "As shown on Slide 19, capital ratios continue to increase with strong internal capital generation. Tier 1 common grew to 8.9%, up over 60 basis points from the fourth quarter and up over 180 basis points from a year ago. Under current Basel III capital proposals, we estimate our Tier 1 common ratio grew to 7.2% this quarter. ", "Our other capital ratios continued to grow as well with Tier 1 capital increasing to 11.5% and Tier 1 leverage to 9.3%. These ratios will reduce by approximately 30 basis points in the quarter as we called $3.2 billion of Trust Preferred Securities that under regulatory capital guidelines, no longer qualify as capital once we gave notice of redemption. Our capital levels continue to demonstrate the ability of Wells Fargo to generate capital organically and as it relates to Basel III standards, the benefit of our diversified lower risk model relative to our large bank peers. ", "As John mentioned at the start of the call, our strong capital position enabled us to begin to return more capital to our shareholders. We took several actions that were contemplated in the capital plan we submitted to the Federal Reserve, including increasing our quarterly dividend rate to $0.12 a share, which is just the first step toward returning to a more normalized payout ratio of 30% over time. ", "I would also highlight that we not only increased our quarterly rate, we actually paid this higher rate in the first quarter, in full, to our shareholders, and the board has already authorized the same payment for the second quarter dividend. We also increased our share repurchase authority by 200 million shares starting this month -- and starting this month, we began to buy back shares. We also expect to call additional Trust Preferred Securities that will no longer count as Tier 1 capital under both Dodd-Frank and Basel III. ", "In summary, we had a very strong first quarter. We are very pleased with our record earnings, reflecting growth across our businesses. The strength of our franchise is reflected in the continuing growth in deposits and high-quality loan originations and deepening customer relationships with record cross-sell. The quality of our loan portfolios resulted in continued reductions in charge-offs, NPAs and early stage delinquencies across our portfolios. Internal capital generation remained strong, enabling us to return more capital to our shareholders. Liquidity remains at a very high level. We believe that our franchise remains very well positioned for the future. ", "I'd like to now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Morford from RBC Capital.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "I guess, Tim, maybe to start, could you talk a bit more about Project Compass and how you're going about that? And more specifically, what are the goals or opportunities for the program, and when we might start seeing -- should see that start to flow through in the numbers?", "Timothy Sloan", "Sure. I'd be happy to, Joe. We started talking about Project Compass in the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we mentioned that we were going to provide more guidance and more detailed guidance in the summer. And the reason for that is that we look at Project Compass as a very important effort on behalf of the company, and we look and we structured it as a bottoms-up process. What we want to do is make sure that we can improve our efficiency and become more cost effective without a reduction in revenue. And so we want to start from the bottom up and talk to all of our folks, as many of our folks as we can, that are closest to the customers, figure out what we can do to improve their ability to deliver better products and services more efficiently to the customers. So in terms of outlook and expectations, we'll provide more detail this summer.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And then just one follow-up.", "John Stumpf", "Joe, let me add to that.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Sure, John.", "John Stumpf", "This is about getting, clearly, more efficient, but it's also becoming more nimble. We want to be able to grow revenues faster, and we think by simplifying some of the things that we do that don't affect customers, actually can help our team spend more time with customers and enhance our revenue growth and become more relevant to our customers. So really it has -- yes, it does have the expense feature, and that's going to be an important part of it, but it's all about growing the business.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And then just a follow up, it sounded like, from your comments, that your expectation for the impact of the Durbin amendment has increased?", "Timothy Sloan", "That's correct. Last quarter, our estimate was $250 million after tax, and we've increased that estimate to about $325 million a quarter after tax primarily because of higher volume in the underlying product.", "John Stumpf", "If you grow checking accounts, of course, yes, and we\u2019re growing them as fast as I've seen in experience I've had with this company for many, many years. It becomes a bigger issue, of course.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Just wondering if -- could you give us any feel for how much in dollars a reduction of 4,500 FTEs in mortgage could help the mortgage expense area?", "Timothy Sloan", "No, we don't have that detail on a per person basis.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "But it's something that we should see move the needle...", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Over the next couple of quarters. That alone should move it.", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes. John, in terms of timing, as we mentioned, we ended the fourth quarter with a good pipeline of mortgages that we needed to underwrite and close, and so we closed those through the first quarter. So we did not begin the reduction in that staff until late in the quarter, so you should expect that, that the reduction in the origination staff should be completed by the end of the second quarter.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "But in terms of magnitude, it's something that we should see move the needle of your overall expense numbers.", "John Stumpf", "Well, yes. It's a meaningful number for the mortgage company, absolutely. And think of it, John, these are processors and fulfillment kind of people. So think about -- and you can do the math there as well as I can. The average compensation, pick a number and you can do it. These are people that, as Tim mentioned, because of the Safe Act, they're actually on payroll as temporaries, and we have a different process in how we reduce that. So you have to give them a couple months notice. So yes, it's a meaningful number.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Last quarter, you had a slide, entitled expense discipline, that showed a sense of cyclically elevated expenses and where you thought they could go to in 2011 and '12, and I don't see that in today's packet. Do those thoughts still hold about those items that you talked about last quarter?", "Timothy Sloan", "John, they do. I think that -- last quarter, we had a few line items in there. One was integration cost, which we provided some detail for this quarter, which were -- and the $440 million was within the range that we talked about for 2011. We continue to be pleased with the rate of loan resolution and loss mitigation cost reduction. We haven't broken out Wells Fargo Financial residual cost, and we're not going to do that anymore because all those portfolios have now been spread across the rest of the company, and it's not necessarily material. But we still feel confident about those ranges that we provided in that slide in the fourth quarter deck.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay and then in terms of Project Compass, you said on the second quarter call, we could expect you to discuss that in a little more detail. And should we think about you announcing some specific targets around that?", "Timothy Sloan", "You know what, I don't know if we're going to announce specific targets beyond, for example, the type of guidance that we provided in that fourth quarter page, but you will see more detail this summer. We'd like to try to put it together by the time of the second quarter earnings announcement, but it may be a little bit later than that.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "But you might do something like that, that former slide where you get some potential quarterly expense progressions.", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes, I think that you should expect something like that.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "My last question is just on the liquidity position, Tim. Why do cash and fed funds portfolios increasing so much? And what will lead you to start investing some of that cash?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, the primary driver for the increase in our liquidity is our deposit growth. As we mentioned, the deposit growth continues to be beyond our expectations. And we were really, really pleased with that growth, particularly, as we mentioned, in the Eastern markets where we're completing the integration and consolidation of the Wachovia stores. But in terms of the timing and decisioning around how and when we might invest that cash in other assets is going to be a function of growth. And then clearly, we want to make sure that we can meet all of our customers\u2019 needs in terms of our loan demand. And then secondly, we were hoping to invest that, those funds, as interest rates go up. We continue to believe that we're more likely to see interest rates go up and go down than go down. And we want to be very careful about investing a lot of funds in this kind of environment, because we don't want to find ourselves a year or 2 from now having invested at a low point in the cycle.", "John Stumpf", "And John, I view this as a real asset of the company. Just think about it, we're growing deposits, and this liquidity is -- we have $100 billion or so invested at 29 basis points. Just think of when we do employ that. And in this point in the cycle, this is not atypical as a recovery happens. You have uneven loan growth. Corporate balance sheets have never been in better shape. Consumers paying down debt. So it's just going to take us and it's going to take the industry some time to and customers some time to borrow and start to draw on lines and we're seeing some of that in the corporate side, but this -- I view this good news, the potential here.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay, thank you, guys.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "If you could just talk about the NIM trajectory going forward. There might be a little bit of benefit from calling the higher cost TruPS. But how should we think about some of the other moving pieces?", "Timothy Sloan", "In terms of the direction of the NIM?", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Correct.", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes, well, it's going to depend. It's going to depend on loan growth and the mix of that loan growth. As we mentioned, we saw a nice loan growth in our Wholesale groups. We haven't seen as much loan growth yet in the consumer portfolio. It's going to depend on the rate of decline in our nonstrategic portfolios, which, as we mentioned, we're down about $6 billion for the quarter. It's going to depend on our decisions, as we were just talking about, related to investing the treasury portfolio. And then it's going to depend on deposit growth. I really can't give you a specific direction in terms of the NIM. I will reinforce, though, that we don't think about running this company based upon the NIM. We think about running the company based upon making sure that we can meet our customers' needs. What comes out of that is, one of the measures, is the NIM. But I can assure you, we're not managing the company based upon NIM.", "John Stumpf", "And the other thing we -- I know you know this, but we, for the big bank peers, we have the best NIM in the industry by some distance. And there is some impact as to how we recognize the PCI resolutions. But I think Tim said, we don't run the company based on that.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Well, maybe just to rephrase the question. I mean, the net interest income dollars came down a bit quarter-to-quarter, and you point to a couple of things that seem like they might be onetime or lumpy. And I'm just trying to get a sense of what you might be thinking from here in terms of some of these moving pieces, or do we just look at this as kind of a run rate and it'll all be driven by loan growth from here?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, again, the current NIM might be the run rate. We'll continue to watch that as we go through each quarter. We do expect that the PCI loan resolution effect within the NIM is going to be lumpy, and it has been ever since the first quarter of 2009.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then just separately, the mortgage originations were down pretty similar to what we're seeing for the overall industry. But if we look at the loan production revenue, that might have come down a little bit more than I would've expected given the decline in originations. And I appreciate the gain on sale came down a little bit this quarter, but I thought it was still pretty solid. So wondering what might have driven down the origination revenue a bit more than the originations there?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, the gain on sale margins declined in the quarter, and that's just a question of the spread in the loans. You saw the refinance. As you pointed out, you saw refinance volume going down, but also, the gain on sale went down because spreads went down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "So just a question on PPOP [ph] . I mean, you got a couple of big levers that you have in the expense line, with merger integration charges coming down and the mortgage line coming down. Obviously, you're going to reinvest some of that into Project Compass. On the top line, you got the rebranding of Wells Fargo going on the entire East Coast. Could you just give us a sense as to how you are thinking about managing all those levers as we go through the next couple of quarters here, maybe even into 2012? Just want to make sure I understand how you're thinking about doing these reinvestments and timing it with what you hope to get from the cross-sell.", "John Stumpf", "Well, Betsy, let me take that. So you think about the company -- there's a lot of stuff going on right now. So we want to complete the Wachovia merger and do that exceedingly well, and I couldn't be happier with how that has gone. Secondly, let's not forget, the improvement in credit quality here. This was, in some people's minds, a big bet on credit, and we thought we did a good job analyzing upfront. And the proof in the pudding is in the eating, as they say, and we sure liked the results. In fact, if you look at the numbers, we've had a better news there than we had planned for. We want it to stay that way, and we're very pleased with that. So those expenses, to complete the merger, will largely extinguish at the end of the year as we finished that integration. We're on schedule. We're on budget. And we have a plan -- I think we have 5 or 6 more events to finish the Eastern integration. So think of that as on schedule and largely in place. And as the passage of time, those will happen. With respect to credit quality, we expect that we will see improvement. And we will get the numbers we're looking for. We've put a lot of people, add a lot of people in this company as the industry has to serve customers who are having challenges. On the mortgage side, for example, we've seen dramatic improvement in our past due. In fact, we are, for the large servicers, an industry-leading position. We've gone from almost 9% delinquency of our servicing portfolio of all of our mortgages, down to just a little over 7% now. That's a 20% improvement. That's a huge move in 5 quarters. There is real people attached to that, and we'll be able to see improvement over time as that happens. And even with what's going to happen in some of the new servicing standards, there'll probably be as much reassignment of some people as anything, but we should see the improvement there. Then with respect to Compass, when you have an opportunity that we have to get rid of some expense that doesn't add to customer value, to make us more efficient, more relevant, we expect that those things are going to happen. And we'll give you more information on that. So there's a variety of things going on. In the meantime, we're growing accounts. We're growing households. In the middle market and wholesale side, we're growing the business there. We have a wonderful global financial institutions group that we're doing a lot of business there. The wealth management business is growing. So there's lots of good things that are happening. But at a time -- in the cycle right now, it's uneven. So that's to be expected. But I'm encouraged that during this period of time now, we're doing all things that we can manage to make a difference for the long-term prosperity of this company.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "So on the East Coast integration, where you've rebranded, to date, how the cross-sell is tracking relative to expectations?", "John Stumpf", "It's better. It's better -- in fact, I can\u2019t tell you -- the only thing we didn't expect is how many pictures people we take into the stagecoach in Manhattan. If we could have figured how to -- what it would cost per every picture, we -- but no, that's just -- it's been much better. In fact, as you recall, we did the economics of the merger. We never put in the revenue synergies, but we had expectations because we saw in other places. But I can tell you, cross-sell is growing faster now than it has since we started measuring this, some 15 or 20 years ago. I can't be more encouraged. And I think you're going to see that accelerate now because all of a sudden, people are seeing the signs. They're seeing the connectivity.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And when do you see that hitting the top line, do you think?", "John Stumpf", "I would say it takes a while for that to run through. Typically, you add products arithmetically. The profitability goes geometrically. So yes, you're going to start seeing that, I think, accelerate the next number of quarters. That's when it comes through. But if you think about the East, and again I want to go back to it one more time, under cross-selling consumer, small numbers times big numbers equals big numbers. We went from just a little over 5 products per household to 5.22 in 1 year. That's huge. We used to add 3 or 4 basis points per year. Adding 20 basis points is -- you just don't see stuff like that.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And then just lastly on buybacks. When would you start the repurchase? Are you waiting for the P-buffer [ph] for discussions, or are you good to go before that.", "John Stumpf", "No, we're buying.", "Timothy Sloan", "Betsy, we started buying shares back this quarter from our benefits plans, which we were allowed to do. And you should expect that we'll, as we've done historically, buyback shares at opportune times. We're going to take advantage of the fact that we've got that authority, so we can deliver more returns for our shareholders.", "John Stumpf", "In fact, we are growing, we\u2019re sitting at the highest capital levels I ever recall in this company. We're growing capital very rapidly. Look at what's happened just the last quarter or the last year. And the one thing I think that Basel did get right is the way they looked at risk. And this company runs with a whole lot less risk than our big bank competitors. So when you look at our capital ratios and the reduction that comes from the Basel III side, it's a fraction of other companies, and that's really important.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "When does your blackout period end after the quarter? When can you start repurchasing?", "Timothy Sloan", "Later today.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Thank you very much. And on -- some of the banks that released earnings this week talked about how they saw a significant slowdown in borrowers\u2019 interest in the second half of the quarter, probably most likely March, driven by events globally, Japan and whatnot. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there on a global sense, so out there for borrower demand?", "Timothy Sloan", "We didn't see any significant decline in our commercial, corporate, real estate customer borrowing levels toward the second half of the quarter. And in fact, our loan volume for international was up. As John mentioned, we have a very, very strong financial institutions business, on an international basis that the combined company has been in for over 100 years, it's called our GFITS business, and we saw good demand in the first quarter.", "John Stumpf", "I would describe loans more as a re-regionalization, if you will, or more product type of the kind business you're in. If you're in the commodities business, that business is doing quite well. We saw activity there. On the other side, if you're on the consumer side, consumers are paying down debt. So it depends on the kind of business, the kind of consumer or the kind of customer. But because of our national franchise because we're in so many different businesses serving customers, we see a variety of things, but we did not see that phenomenon that others have talked about.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "And then on the side of the jumbo market, I mean, there has been some banks that have reported some increases in jumbo loans on their balance sheets. Have you seen the jumbo market improve, especially since some of the discussions with treasury where they want to lower the conforming loan rates?", "Timothy Sloan", "No, not in reaction to any changes that are coming from the treasury. I mean, as you can imagine, given our platform, we originate a large number of jumbo loans. And we're continuing to keep some on the balance sheet. We didn't keep as many on the balance sheet in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter, just because the volume was so high in the third and fourth quarter. If you look at our individual business line segments, you can -- we can say that within our wealth management and brokerage business that a good portion of the loan growth was related to jumbo loans.", "John Stumpf", "The jumbo volume is more dependent -- is more connected to just the activity in the marketplace. That's the biggest...", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. Hey, thanks a lot, guys.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "I'm stuck on Page 28 of the presentation, the PCI accretable yield. And a very technical question, did you shorten the amortization period for the accretable yield roll forward?", "Timothy Sloan", "No.", "John Stumpf", "So there's different terms or different time premise depending on the type of loan. I think it was consumer, it was something like 9 years and commercial, something like a couple of years, but...", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "But the gist to my question is why did accretable yield contribute more this quarter than last quarter?", "Timothy Sloan", "Oh, the first quarter included a gain of about $150 million from the sale of a pool of consumer real estate loans.", "John Stumpf", "So Mike, if you look at Pick-a-Pay, just last quarter, we had the average life was 9.4 years. This quarter, we thought we would be 9.3 years which we\u2019re one more quarter into it. And on the commercial side, we were at 1.8 years with the life of that portfolio. Now we're at 2 years. So they're largely unchanged. And Tim had the answer for that.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Maybe if I can back up a little bit, but I look at the end-of-period balance for the accretable yield roll forward from the third to the fourth quarter that stayed about flat. And from the fourth to the first quarter, that was $800 million less. So does that mean that you had an $800 million benefit in net interest income? And if so, what does that mean for the future quarters?", "Timothy Sloan", "No, Mike. We could provide you with -- I'll have Jim follow up and provide you with more detail. But you shouldn't expect that the results for the first quarter are going to have any material impact on what you should expect for the future quarters. As John pointed out, the duration in our expectations is pretty similar to the fourth quarter.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "All right, yes, I can follow up offline. Just another technical accounting question. So it seems like your guidance for the tax rate stays about the same at 32% for the year, but you had an adverse decision in the Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. on Friday.", "Timothy Sloan", "Right.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And so how much might you have to pay to the IRS? And why doesn't that get reflected in your tax guidance for the year? Can we talk to that line item?", "Timothy Sloan", "Good question, Mike. We were obviously very disappointed in the decision. We originated the underlying leases in early part of the last decade. And what's ironic is that both state and federal governments were very, very much encouraged us and encouraged those products at that time. We feel very strongly about our position. Obviously, the court felt differently, but we were fully reserved for that decision. So there's not going to be an impact from that decision this year.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, this is a very sensitive question but it's still a question that still comes up in a lot of my discussions. And that is, why did the prior CFO leave the firm? Could you add anything to the topic?", "John Stumpf", "Mike, that is so yesterday. I mean, we've got a terrific CFO. We're moving forward. I can't be happier with how things are going here, and we're looking to the future.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "All right. Well, I look forward to working with you, Tim.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thanks, mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "As I look at the operating expense base currently, and I know there's been a few questions related to this but just trying to sort of run through it mathematically, I see $440 million of integration costs, $472 million of operating losses. You talked about potential benefits from reducing the headcount on the mortgage side of the business and then also Project Compass, so those four things. I don't know what they all would quite add up to, but it strikes me that you could potentially be running at a quarterly expense run rate of $12 billion or less by 2012. Is that a reasonable conclusion on my part?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, based on the math that you just described, you can get to that number. I think and the way that we think about our expenses are going to be much more a reflection of what our revenue looks like in the mix in our businesses. Some of our businesses are more efficient and have less expenses per dollar of revenue than others. I know you wish I could give you a more defined answer, but I'm not able to do that. It's really going to be much more an effect on the mix of the business as well as our projects on -- our progress, excuse me, on expenses. But there's no question that we're going to make progress.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Let me ask you a different question, let me ask it a slightly different way. If I come up with sort of my own math on those numbers, would you expect the underlying growth, sort of excluding those four things, in the franchise, the underlying expense growth in the franchise to be fairly minimal in '12 versus '11? So if these things sort of come out, there's not going to be a big offset from sort of underlying core expense growth or will there be?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, again, when we think about core expense growth, we think about it based upon the opportunities we have to grow our businesses. And so, for example, we've been adding new salespeople and relationship managers in Wholesale Banking for the last year. So would that affect core expense growth? You bet it would. The reason we've done it is because we've got opportunities to bring new people on to the platform. We've done that. We've done the same in our wealth management business, because there's terrific financial advisers to bring out. That would affect the core expenses, too. So I appreciate the difference in how you asked your question, but I'm afraid you're going to get the same answer.", "John Stumpf", "Ed, here\u2019s how I think about that. I think about the 275,000 or 280,000 team members we have, there's a group that are servicing -- there's group that sell products and services to our customers. There's a team that services that, and there's a team that supports that. And we want to make sure that we have the business aligned around our customers in a way that we can react to customer opportunities and to company opportunities and not be burdened with additional expense that makes it more difficult for us to do that business, that we're slower. So for example, how many data centers do we need? And how many different customer information files do we need? How many different places do we need to do the same business in how many different divisions? So those are the kind of things that we're going to -- that we are attacking, that we are -- and it's a good time to do it because now we're almost done with the Wachovia merger. And we can see how it is to operate in this new larger platform. But as Tim said, we don't -- this is hopefully going to help us accelerate growth. So we're surely going to -- and take the mortgage company, for example. If all of a sudden, we get a housing boom, we're going to want to add team members to capture that growth. And I know you'll appreciate that, but that's how we think about it.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then to follow up, you talked about how you already have been repurchasing some stock. You can get back in there this afternoon and start buying back more. Is it reasonable for us to think that you're going to repurchase or get close to repurchasing that whole 200 million share authorization this year?", "Timothy Sloan", "You know what, it's going to be a function of how we view the stock price more than anything. We're going to repurchase stock based upon the capital plan that we submitted to the Fed. And it's going to be based upon that. It's going to be based upon what the stock price looks like, and it's going to be based upon liquidity. But I wouldn't necessarily conclude that we're going to buy 200 million shares next month, or by the end of the year, we might. But it's really going to depend on market conditions and our performance.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "And then just one final question. Any insight on when down the road, I know this is sort of tough to look out, but you might get to the point where you're no longer incurring a significant mortgage repurchase cost and you can sort of play out the remaining repurchases through the existing reserve. Is that several quarters away? Or is that more like a couple of years away?", "Timothy Sloan", "You know what, I don't have a good answer for you. My crystal ball is a little bit cloudy there. What we do know is that things are improving faster than we would have expected 3 months ago, 6 months ago and 9 months ago. Again, I think that's a reflection of the fact that our portfolio, both what we own and we service for ourselves and what we service for others, is just a higher quality than everybody else's. So I think that the industry, while it continues to be under stress, I think when you look at Wells Fargo, we're just a little bit different. But I really couldn't tell you exactly when it's going to go away, but it sure to improve this quarter.", "John Stumpf", "I think if you think about how that portfolio was built and how it performs and you look at what the risks are in the industry, I think the biggest risks are in the private side. And if you look at our portfolio, a small percentage of our servicing is private, and about half of that doesn't carry a lot of the traditional reps and warranties. And it's evidenced by the kind of repurchase we've been seeing. When you have 7% of your portfolio, 7.22% past due versus some of our competitors at 10%, 12% or even 14%, that's a huge difference. Secondly, if you have 7% of your portfolio private, of which half of that doesn't carry traditionals, it makes the math such that it's not something that I spend a lot of time worrying about. Now if we have a double dip, if we have another whole thing that I don't expect, all bets are off. But I sure like the trajectory and the trend, you can't argue with that. I couldn't be happier there.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.", "Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Yes, I'm wondering with regard to what's required of you under the consent orders for mortgage servicing. I don't care so much about the existing stock of problems that we're working through, but does it change the underlying economics of the mortgage servicing business going forward? I mean, does it structurally impact your cost? And can you recover those costs in pricing? And how, on a going forward basis, can you price the product effectively to reflect those costs?", "John Stumpf", "Well, we like the mortgage servicing business. It's been a good business for a lot of years. It still a good business. Part of what we get in that business is the servicing fee, the 25 basis points. We get a higher propensity when those customers refinance. They refinance with us, and we also sell those customers other products and services. So we like that a lot. As Tim mentioned in his comments, with respect to the existing, what we know about the changes that have come about through either legislation or through the performance of the portfolio, we have priced it into our MSR. And what we don't know, we actually put a reserve up. We added to -- substantially all of the litigation charge we took was related to mortgage for this quarter. But going forward, I think is where your comment or your biggest part of your question is, it's going to be 1 or 2 things, either we're going to get paid for it and we're going to be in the business or if you can't get paid for it, people are going to do something else with their money. And this is a necessary important part of the mortgage business, and quality matters. And others might have a different view because they have a much more troubled portfolio, ours doesn't have that. And it's a business that I suspect will be part of a discussion as in the future GSEs get reformatted or we figure out how -- what life is like in the future. And my guess is that it'll continue to be a good business for those who do it well.", "Christoph Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "So I mean, I guess what you're saying is that, I mean, the ultimate business model will take years to figure out and shake out. In the meantime, we're kind of stuck with a 25 basis point servicing fee, and the only way you protect yourself is by being very, very careful on underwriting, right?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, I wouldn't describe it as being stuck with a 25 basis point servicing fee. I mean, this is a very profitable business for us. We like this business. And even with the incremental cost that we've incurred for servicing and foreclosure, it's still a profitable business for us. And so as John mentioned, we like it. We think we're good at it. In the past, we've made some mistakes. We fix them when we find them, but we think we're very good at it. And again, our servicing businesses are also a reflection of the quality of the portfolio, and the quality of the portfolio that we service is the highest of our big bank peers. So overall, we like the business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "This is sort of an add-on to Chris's question, I guess. Given what is going on in the mortgage business, generally, all these proposals or thoughts that are sort of swirling around Fannie and Freddie, et cetera, et cetera, your company has always been, and rightfully so, regarded as the major mortgage player among the large banks. And that has always helped your stock, I think. But in the past few weeks or couple of months, I think your stock has begun to be sort of negatively impacted by this speculation around mortgage. John, could just give us your view of how you see the mortgage business shaking out over the long term with regard to Fannie and Freddie, and how it may impact the relative size of the business for you?", "John Stumpf", "Well, I was hoping you'd ask Tim that question.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Well, he can answer.", "John Stumpf", "I'm just teasing, Nancy. It's an important question because for most families, the home purchase is the most significant financial transaction they'll ever have. It affects the whole family. The whole family gets involved in it, and it's an important thing. And we want to make sure we get it right. I give credit to the administration and to members of congress. It's now becoming part of the active discussion and debate in Washington. As you saw, there were 3 proposals. Wells Fargo has opined, and we've made some of our own comments known about -- and I actually had an article not too long ago in the FORTUNE Magazine about some views about this. So I'm hopeful, let's just put it that way. I'm hopeful when we get all done with this, whatever that timeframe is, and it'll take -- it probably won't happen this month or this year, it's going to take some time because there's very divergent views on this, that mortgage money will be available for consumers. It'll be available broadly at prices that make sense but also reflect the risk. Whatever the government's involvement is ought to be explicit and they got to get paid for it. The private sector ought to play a large role in this. And this whole idea about risk retention, ought to reflect the fact that everybody who touches a mortgage ought to be interested in making sure it's a good mortgage. So whatever happens there. So I think, when we get all said and done, I'm optimistic we'll get this right.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "But you were, correct me if I'm wrong, but you were a supporter of the QRM guidelines or suggestions as they came out from the FDIC. Is that correct?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, But we have a view that we ought to be careful about QRM to this extent that we'd not punish the mortgage that don't make it into the QRM. So if you start to broaden the QRM view, the qualified residential mortgages, when you have one that does not qualify, it could be so price different, in other words, more expensive, that you got to be careful there. And if the QRM is too broad, not enough discipline around that, then you're going to have more people trying to force things in the QRM to get around the retention side. So I mean, this is just one of many, many issues.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Okay, thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Christopher Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey, Tim, just a quick question. I want to go back to John McDonald's question and ask it little differently. On the $100-and-so billion in cash and short-term investments, when the new world order is set from Basel III in liquidity, what do you think a run rate for that type of cash and that type of balance will be? Will it be half that? I'm try to figure out how much revenue you're leaving off, off the table, if you will, by investing $100 billion in 25 bps. Can $50 billion be invested in 5-year treasuries over time?", "Timothy Sloan", "Chris, that's a good question. I wish I could give you the answer. And the reason I'm hesitant is that we're in the midst of discussions with regulators, with the Fed, very, very productive discussions from our perspective, a lot of give and take. But until we complete the discussions, I couldn't comment specifically on whether it's 1/2 or 3/4 or 2/3 or what. Clearly, we're not maintaining, and I want to make sure this is really clear, we're not maintaining $100 billion of liquidity because we're concerned about where the LCR is going to end up. That's not what's preventing us from investing more of that. What we're hesitant about is investing more today on what we think are lower rates.", "Christopher Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes, I understand. I'm looking at your unrealized gains of $9 billion. So clearly, you're taking on less risks than some others. If I use $50 billion at 175 basis point spread, assuming a 5-year treasury at 2%, but you're already earning 25 basis points on this, you're going to be leaving over $220 million a quarter off the table?", "John Stumpf", "I would not disagree with your math.", "Christopher Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, all right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "That was your final question. I will now turn the floor back over to you.", "John Stumpf", "Well, I want to thank all of you for joining the call. I appreciate your questions. And again, thank you for your time, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call.

My name is Celeste, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn today's call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Celeste, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today, during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and CFO, Tim Sloan, will review second quarter results and answer your questions. ", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call and that those forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing in the earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website at wellsfargo.com. ", "I will now turn the call over to John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, and thanks for joining us today. The results we will review with you this morning are a product of our steadfast focus on 5 key priorities: helping customers succeed, growing revenue, reducing expense, living our vision and values and building strong relationships with our key stakeholders. The second quarter also reflected the strengths of Wells Fargo diversified business model and operating culture which continued to produce record high results in a tough economic business climate. ", "In the second quarter, all of our business fundamentals moved in the right direction, revenues, loans, deposits, expenses, credit and capital. This is how we delivered the highest earnings in Wells Fargo's history with net income of $3.9 billion, an increase of 29% from a year ago, and an EPS of $0.70, up 27% over the same period. ", "Our strong financial performance led to strong internal capital generation, producing an estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III capital proposals of 7.4%. We grew capital even as we rewarded our loyal shareholders through dividends and with the reinstatement of our share buyback program during the quarter. ", "The second quarter also included many examples of the ongoing benefit of our merger with Wachovia, beginning with the successful completion of our largest state conversion, Florida. With Florida now operating under the Wells Fargo brand, we have 83% of our banking customers on a single system, a powerful advantage for the future. We have converted 2,215 Wachovia stores as well as 23.7 million customer accounts, including mortgage, deposits, trust, brokerage and credit cards. ", "Our success reflects the tremendous effort made by our entire team. For the conversions in Pennsylvania and Florida alone, team members in our banking stores completed over 217,000 hours of training and practice. To help support our stores during conversion, 2,360 bankers from stores in the West each spent more than a week in the converted states to ensure a smooth transition. ", "But the biggest benefit of the largest merger in our industry's history are revenue synergies, many of which we are already starting to realize. They reflect the payoffs that are possible when a team has a plan, follows it with discipline and doesn't allow headwinds to distract them. ", "Let me highlight just a few. Our continued strong growth in consumer checking accounts demonstrates our success at attracting new customers even during the integration. In our eastern retail banking stores, consumer checking accounts were up over 30% from a year ago. New credit card accounts also grew in the East, growing more than 140% from a year ago as we began to see a meaningful lift in credit card penetration rates in our converted markets, up from 13.2% at the end of 2010 to 14.5% at the end of the second quarter. ", "Wachovia had a well-run Auto business before the merger, and it has only become a more robust part of Wells Fargo, growing indirect auto loans by more than 50% since the merger. Our market share has also increased, and that has made Wells Fargo the largest used car auto lender and the second largest overall auto lender in the industry. ", "Wholesale Banking businesses have benefited from the merger as well, with more customers, a broader product line and higher cross-sell. For example, year-to-date, our investment banking market share for 2011 was 4.7%, up from 3.7% for the first 6 months of 2009. ", "Investment banking revenue with corporate and commercial customers also has increased, growing 53% during the first 6 months of 2011 versus the same period last year, reflecting continued success in cross-selling investment banking products to our wholesale customer base. ", "Foreign exchange revenue from wholesale customers is also up 24% during the first 6 months of 2011 versus the first 6 months of 2010. And trade fees in the second quarter from corporate and commercial customers were up 13% annualized in the first quarter. ", "In Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement, the benefit of converting to one system and greater scale in each of its businesses are reflected in a 27% increase in client assets since the merger. The retail brokerage business, which is the third largest full-service brokerage business, retail brokerage firm in the U.S., continued to grow with net flows of more than $50 billion into managed accounts since the merger. And by focusing on meeting all the financial needs of our customers, Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement's and deposits have grown 28%, and broker loan originations have grown by 47% since the merger. ", "Clearly, it was an outstanding quarter, and we aren't stopping here. As our CFO, Tim Sloan, will highlight in a few moments as he walks through the quarter's details, we think our opportunities to operate more cost effectively are just as promising as the growth opportunities that we believe lie ahead of us, and are important as we continue to help even more customers succeed financially in the future. ", "Now let me turn this over to Tim Sloan.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the slide presentation included in the first half of the quarterly supplement starting on Slide 2. I want to focus my comments today on 4 areas. ", "First, the drivers behind our strong business results this quarter, which included record earnings, up 5% from the first quarter, our highest ROA in 3 years; continued improvement in credit and linked-quarter growth in revenue, loans, deposits and pretax pre-provision profit. ", "Second, as I promised, I will discuss our focus on reducing expenses, including Project Compass and our $11 billion quarterly noninterest expense target by the fourth quarter of 2012. ", "Third, I will update you on our current mortgage issues, including the quality of our servicing portfolio, mortgage repurchases, securities litigation and consent orders and also highlight some of the actions that we've already taken. ", "Finally, I'll conclude with an update on our growing capital levels and capital actions. ", "Let me start by highlighting just how strong our results were this quarter and our many areas of growth. We achieved record EPS of $0.70, up 4% from the first quarter. Our revenue was up $57 million from Q1, with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. Growth was broad based, with several businesses generating double-digit annualized linked-quarter growth, including corporate banking, commercial real estate, debit card, insurance, international, merchant services, retirement services and SBA lending. ", "Pre-tax pre-provision profit was $7.9 billion, up 4% from the first quarter. Our period-end loans were up $766 million, and average core deposits increased $10.7 billion from the first quarter. ", "The benefit of our continued focus on meeting our customers' lending needs throughout the past few years helped produce loan growth this quarter despite the continued reduction in our liquidating portfolio. Our core loan portfolio, which excludes the liquidating portfolio, grew by $5.8 billion from the first quarter. Loan growth in this quarter was driven by our commercial portfolio, which grew $7.5 billion or 2% from the first quarter. Growth was diverse across commercial businesses including linked-quarter growth in commercial banking, commercial real estate, corporate banking, capital finance, asset-backed finance and international. ", "Consumer loans were down 2% from the first quarter, driven by the liquidating portfolio runoff, partially offset by growth in auto, credit card and private student lending. The runoff of the liquidating portfolio continued as expected, down $5 billion from the first quarter and down $69 billion or 36% since the Wachovia merger. ", "Deposit growth remained very strong in this quarter, driven by new account and balance growth. Average core deposits were up $10.7 billion from the first quarter and up $45.7 billion or 6% from a year ago and were 107% of average loans. Average checking and savings deposits were up $735 billion, up 9% from a year ago and were 91% of average core deposits, up from 88% a year ago. Consumer checking accounts were up 7% from a year ago. ", "The strong growth we achieved throughout our banking states demonstrates our ability to both acquire and retain customers as we successfully complete the largest merger integration in the industry. While deposit rates are at historically low levels, we continue to bring down deposit yields, with average deposit cost declining to 28 basis points, down from 30 basis points in the first quarter and down 35 basis points from a year ago. ", "Turning to Slide 6. As I've mentioned, our revenue growth this quarter was driven by growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. Tax-equivalent net interest income increased $39 million from the first quarter. The increase was driven by the period-end balance of our available-for-sale securities portfolio increasing $18 billion, reflecting deployment of excess liquidity and the decline in our long-term debt expense from the maturity of debt and the redemption of high-cost trust preferred securities. These positives were partially offset by the decline in mortgages held for sale, driven by lower funding volumes and the fact that loan growth in the core loan portfolio was offset by expected runoff in the higher-yielding liquidating portfolio. These loans generally have higher charge-offs and cost more to service. ", "Noninterest income was up $30 million from the first quarter, with growth in deposit service charges, trust and investment fees, card fees, processing fees, insurance, equity gains and operating leases, more than offsetting declines in mortgage. The increase in card fees, up 46% or 5% from Q1 reflects an 8% increase in debit card volume and a 13% increase in credit card volume. ", "New credit card accounts were up 12% from the first quarter and up 63% from a year ago. Mortgage banking revenue was down to $397 million or 20% from the first quarter, reflecting a $20 billion decline in origination volume. As rates declined in this quarter, there was an increase in application volume and the unclosed mortgage pipe line increased $6 billion to $51 billion as of the end of the second quarter. ", "With the final Federal Reserve rules regarding debit interchange fees, we have lowered our estimate of the impact on our earnings to approximately $250 million quarterly after tax before any offsets starting in the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect to recapture at least half of this through volume -- half of this over time through volume and product changes. ", "Our second quarter results also benefited from lower expenses. Noninterest expense was down $258 million or 2% from the first quarter and down $865 million from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by lower commissions and incentive compensation, employee benefit cost and equipment expense. ", "Second quarter expenses included only $10 million of higher FDIC insurance assessments, which is lower than our previous guidance. Our assessment reflects the fact that deposits as a percentage of assets is greater than many of our peers. ", "Second quarter expenses also included $484 million of merger integration costs, up $44 million from the first quarter, reflecting increased integration activity. And finally, second quarter expenses included $428 million of operating losses, substantially all driven by litigation accruals for mortgage foreclosure-related matters. ", "As I promised last quarter, I'm going to spend some time on the call today talking about our expense initiative, Project Compass. This starts on Slide 9. Project Compass is a company-wide initiative focused on removing unnecessary complexity and eliminating duplication as a way to improve the customer experience and the work process of our team members. While Project Compass is focused on reducing expenses, we are using a bottoms-up approach to ensure revenue is not adversely affected. Wells Fargo is still a very -- very focused on growing revenue as we did this quarter. And we believe that if we do this right, we will have increased revenue and a more streamlined operating model. ", "Project Compass has 3 main areas of focus. First, staff and technology functions. As our company has grown, we have become more complex. We are focused on removing unnecessary complexity and eliminating duplication in our staff functions. Throughout the merger integration, we have been focused on IT consistency, one platform throughout our company to serve our customers seamlessly. ", "With Project Compass, we're focused on simplifying the technology environment across our company, particularly in such areas as data centers, help desk and application development and support. For example, we recently moved technology support for human resources, finance, corporate properties and Internet services under the corporate technology group. ", "Second, loan resolution, loss mitigation and foreclosed asset expenses should decline as the credit cycle improves. At the same time, process improvements can also be made in this area, such as automating asset tracking and payment processing and centralizing certain functions. ", "The third area of focus is business optimization, which consists of business efficiency and business portfolio reviews. Business efficiency is focused on ensuring team members are supporting revenue-generating activity as cost effectively as possible by removing unnecessary complexity and duplication. To date, we've consolidated our auto business and reorganized our wealth management business to improve business efficiency. ", "Business portfolio review is a continuation of our long-standing practice of reviewing all lines of business to ensure they are generating appropriate returns and work within our business model. As a result of these reviews, we've closed Wells Fargo Financial stores, exited the reverse mortgage business and announced the sale of H.D. Vest. ", "As a result of Compass initiatives and the completion of merger integration activities, we are targeting quarterly noninterest expenses to decline to $11 billion by the fourth quarter of 2012, down 12% from the $12.5 billion this quarter. The target reflects expense-save initiatives that will be executed over the next 6 quarters. However, quarterly expense trends may vary due to factors such as cyclical or seasonal increases, particularly in the first quarter when higher incentive compensation and employee benefit expenses typically occur. Our $11 billion target includes currently contemplated investments in our businesses and team members, such as hiring more team members in banking stores in the East. ", "Turning to our segment results, starting on Slide 13. Community Banking earned $2.1 billion, down 4% from the first quarter, reflecting lower mortgage banking results. Other businesses within Community Banking continued to grow. We had record retail banking cross-sell of 5.84 products, up from 5.64 a year ago. With cross-sell in the East at 5.29 products compared to the West at 6.25, we have plenty of opportunity to continue to grow across our franchise. Over the past year, we have added an incremental 1,500 platform banker FTEs in the East, up 16%, to better capture this opportunity. Core product sales in the West were over $8.3 million, up 16% from the prior year. Core product sales in the East grew by double digits. ", "Wholesale Banking earned $1.9 billion, up 17% from the first quarter, with revenue up 3%, expenses down 1% and continued improvement in credit cost. Linked-quarter revenue growth was driven by strong results across many businesses, including investment banking, Eastdil Secured, commercial real estate, international, corporate banking and insurance. These results also reflect strong loan growth, up 4% from the first quarter, which was broad-based across a number of the wholesale businesses. This growth reflects our commitment to meeting our wholesale customers' financial needs. We continued to meet with our customers and grew our customer base when the market was soft, and we are now benefiting from the relationships we both expanded and built during the past 3 years. ", "Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $333 million, down 2% from the first quarter, driven by lower brokerage transaction revenue, reflecting lower market activity; while asset-based fees remained strong, up 3% from the first quarter. Expenses were down 3% from the first quarter due to lower personnel cost. Average loans were up 2% from the first quarter, with growth in brokerage lines of credit, margin loans and wealth. Managed account assets were up 3% from the first quarter, driven by strong net flows. Our continued focus on helping customers succeed financially drove cross-sell to 9.9 products, up from 9.7 a year ago. ", "Credit quality continued to improve, as shown on Slide 17. Charge-offs declined for the sixth consecutive quarter, down $372 million from the first quarter and 48% below the peak in the fourth quarter of 2009. Provision expense was $1.8 billion, down $372 million from the first quarter, including $1 billion reserve release. Absent a significant deterioration in the economy, we expect future reserve releases. ", "Other credit metrics continued to show improvement. Nonperforming assets were down $2.6 billion or 8% from the first quarter, driven by loans returning to performing status, loan payoffs, loan sales, improved success in home modifications and increased short sale activity. Nonaccrual loan inflows were down 15% from the first quarter. Loans 90 days past due declined for the sixth consecutive quarter, down $598 million from the first quarter or 25%. Early stage delinquencies, both balances and rates, also declined from the first quarter. ", "We believe our servicing portfolio is among the best in the industry. Our portfolio is fundamentally different from other large mortgage servicers. Starting on Slide 19, we highlight the quality of our portfolio. ", "The majority of our $1.8 trillion residential servicing portfolio, or 69%, is service for the agencies. Only 6% are private securitizations where we originated the loans. As a reminder, the characteristics of our non-agency securitization portfolio are different from our larger peers. 80% were prime origination, 58% are from pre-2006 vintages, there is an insignificant amount of home equity and there are no option arms. Approximately 50% of the private securitizations do not have traditional reps and warranties. 6% of the total servicing portfolio is non-agency acquired servicing and private home loan sales, with the majority having repurchase recourse with the originator. The remaining 19% are loans we hold on our balance sheet and losses are recognized through the loan loss reserves and the PCI-nonaccretable difference. ", "The quality of our portfolio is demonstrated by our delinquency and foreclosure rate. Once again, based upon the most recent publicly available data, our rate was the lowest among large bank peers and was over 300 basis points lower than the industry average. Total outstanding repurchase demands are down in both number and balances for the fourth consecutive quarter. Losses on repurchases also declined from $331 million in the first quarter to $261 million in the second quarter. Agency repurchase demands were up modestly from the first quarter due to an acceleration in the timing of the review of defaulted loans on older vintages. We do not believe this acceleration increases our future demand risk. Total non-agency repurchase demands declined for the third consecutive quarter. We added $242 million to the repurchase reserve this quarter, essentially flat with the $249 million we added last quarter. ", "Let me highlight a few other mortgage-related matters. We recently reached a preliminary settlement of $125 million to address Securities Law claims by buyers of private label mortgage-backed securities. This settlement should resolve pending Securities Law claims for most purchasers of our private label mortgage-backed securities. If approved, this settlement would have no future P&L impact since it has been considered in our litigation reserves. ", "As we discussed last quarter, we entered into consent orders with the OCC and the fed regarding foreclosure processing this year. We remain committed to full compliance and we are enhancing several aspects of our servicing, including single point of contact. We remain committed to helping our customers who are experiencing financial difficulties. And we have done approximately 695,000 trial and completed modifications since 2009, and we have forgiven over $4 billion of principal. ", "In addition to these actions to help our customers, we have continued to reflect our best estimates of potential costs surrounding mortgage-related issues in our financial results. We have reduced the value of our MSR asset by $445 million in the second quarter, and have reduced the value of this asset by over $2.5 billion over the past 2.5 years to reflect higher servicing and foreclosure cost. And as I previously mentioned, we also had $428 million of operating losses in the second quarter, substantially all from litigation accruals from mortgage foreclosure-related matters. ", "As shown on Slide 22, capital ratios continued to grow through strong internal capital generation. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio increased to 9.16%, up 23 basis points from the first quarter and up 155 basis points from a year ago. Under current Basel III capital proposals, our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio grew to 7.4% this quarter. $3.4 billion of trust preferred were redeemed in the second order with a weighted average coupon of 7.44%. We expect to redeem additional trust preferred securities in the second half of this year. We restarted our open market common stock repurchase program and repurchased 35 million shares in the second quarter, and we will continue to opportunistically buyback our stock. ", "In summary, our strong results this quarter reflect strength throughout our franchise as we produce quarterly growth in revenue, loans and deposits. And our return on assets was 1.27%, our highest ROA in 3 years. The decline in noninterest expense from the first quarter is just the beginning of our efforts, targeting $11 billion in quarterly noninterest expense by the fourth quarter of 2012. The quality of our loan portfolios resulted in continued improvement in charge-offs, nonperforming assets and early stage delinquencies across our portfolios. Our capital levels continued to grow, and we returned more capital to our shareholders. ", "We're optimistic that the momentum demonstrated in our results this quarter will drive future growth as we complete the Wachovia merger integration, remain disciplined on expenses and continue to focus on meeting the financial needs of our customers. ", "I will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "I just wanted to make sure. You said you were going to be doing a portfolio review, and you've mentioned that in the context of the expenses. Does that suggest that there would be any revenues impacted by a portfolio review or not?", "John Stumpf", "No. I wouldn't read that into it. We're always looking at our portfolios and what makes sense, but no, I wouldn't go -- that's not our intention.", "Timothy Sloan", "And Betsy, I would just reinforce that the $11 billion target that we set for the fourth quarter of next year assumes revenue growth. We believe that we can achieve that target by continuing to grow our revenues.", "Timothy Sloan", "And Betsy, just let me highlight that. Nothing -- revenues remains king around here. And we think that by becoming more efficient, we actually can grow revenue faster. We'll be more competitive on the Street, so -- and we have, as Tim mentioned in his comments, we have assumed in these numbers, adding more people, putting more feet on the street. And if we see some opportunity between now and the end of 2012, we'll even do more.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just separately on Page 6, you talked through the NII during the quarter. Can you talk about what kind of mitigating factors you have to deal with, the potential for further earning asset yield compression?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, I think that the key for the business is to continue to grow loans. And we were able to grow loans on a sequential basis, particularly in our wholesale portfolios in the quarter, which was really exciting. We saw a decline in the rate of the drop off in the non-core, nonstrategic portfolios. I think in addition as we mentioned, we purchased about $18 billion of AFS securities, high-quality short-duration assets toward the end of the quarter. We'll continue to look for those types of opportunities. And it's also likely that we'll hold more mortgages that we originate on the sheet.", "John Stumpf", "Especially as the conforming caps come down.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Right, that's going to happen in September. So as you move into fourth quarter, is there -- can you give us any sense of how much you're expecting to retain relative to current run rate?", "Timothy Sloan", "No. We don't have a good estimate for that right now because we're not 100% sure what jumbo origination would be in terms of that mortgage class. But it's likely that we're going to hold more mortgages on the balance sheet than we did in the second quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Tim, a question on the noninterest expense side and the target. The foreclosed asset expense doesn't decline that much in your target by fourth quarter of 2012. And I guess, does that assume that you're still working through the cycle there, and there's more room to improve that particular line beyond the fourth quarter of 2012?", "Timothy Sloan", "That's a reasonable assumption, John.", "John Stumpf", "But I'd also say, John, there are some additional costs because of regulatory reform and some of the consent order that we had to build into our thinking there.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So some piece of that is still cyclically elevated, and some of it's just going to be structurally a little bit higher than it was historically.", "John Stumpf", "Correct. That's a good way of thinking of it.", "Keith Horowitz - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. Another question is you're not a huge International player, but you do have some businesses. Could you comment on your exposure to the troubled economies in Europe and how you think about risks there for your business?", "Timothy Sloan", "Sure. Right now, we have $3.2 billion of exposure to the countries affectionately called PIIGS. Most of it -- very little of that exposure is sovereign risk. Most of it's the corporates and bonds. Having said that, one of the real benefits from putting Wells Fargo and Wachovia together was growing our international presence. And our GFITS business is a terrific business. And we'll continue to grow Internationally, but we'd want to do it in a way where we take appropriate credit risk and deal with the right customers.", "John Stumpf", "And John, most of our international business, first of all, it's a very small percentage of our revenue. But as Tim mentioned, it's a business we like a lot. It's a correspondent business for central and international commercial banks. And it's highly biased or skewed towards foreign exchange, trade and those kinds of things, but it's a very small piece of our overall company.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Last question is could you give us any color on where you stand in terms of building reserves for litigation and regulatory matters, including the AG discussions? Is this process of building litigation reserves likely to go on for a while? Any of you?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, here's how I think about that. First, I'm not going to speculate on the ultimate outcome of the discussion with the AGs and the Department of Justice. But the reserves, the litigation reserves we have today, reflect our best estimate of the estimable and probable outcomes of the discussions and conversations we've had. And remember in addition to that, we've also written down the MSR by $2.5 billion to reflect the future costs of servicing those mortgages. And we, of course, have a loan loss reserve that we believe is adequate considering all the discussions we've had. So think of it in those 3 ways. It's our best estimate for what we know today.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then one quick follow-up, Tim, on Betsy's discussion around the NIM and the NII. So as you look ahead, how would you kind of summarize the puts and takes for the net interest income and the NIM going forward here?", "Timothy Sloan", "In terms of what the NIM might look like in future quarters?", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Just positives and negatives, and where the key variables are. And what leverage you might have, and what environmental factors are going to influence whether you're able to grow NII and keep the NIM stable?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, I think that the key leverage we have is just to continue to grow loans. I mean, we've got -- we've really grown relationships, we've talked about the success of the merger integration. And so that's number one. I think number two, as we talked about in the past, to the extent that rates rise a bit, we'll invest at a faster pace than we're investing our excess liquidity today. Having said that, as we mentioned in the second quarter, we took advantage of some short-duration assets that we found attractive. Again, these are high-quality, well-underwritten. We'll continue to do that.", "John Stumpf", "John, I think of it this way. We have a NIM around 4% now in probably one of the toughest environments I've ever seen. I mean, there's very tepid loan demand. We are winning new relationships, but you got to run pretty hard just to cover the runoff of some things that we'd like to see run off. And this wonderful deposit franchise we have is, I think, really undervalued in today's economic times. So these are pretty tough headwinds and we're doing pretty well in that. And we're also sitting on almost $90 billion of liquidity that's -- we're not even earning the cost of our deposits on that. So I mean, we have some real dry powder here, if you will.", "Timothy Sloan", "And John, just the final point, and that is when you look at one of the reasons that our liability costs came down, it was because we repurchased some drops. As I mentioned, we'll continue to repurchase drops in the second half of the year, as well as the fact that we've got about $20 billion of debt that's going to mature in the second half of the year. And I think we'll reduce our funding cost there too.", "John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "And can we assume the amount that you deployed this quarter, Tim, was pretty small relative to the $90 billion of liquidity? Can you tell us?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes, that is correct. Yes, absolutely.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Can you comment on the timing of the expense reductions as we think about getting from the mid-12s down to the 11% range over the next, I guess it's 6 quarters? Is that a straight line, front-ended, back-ended?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes. It's not back-ended, and it's probably not going to be front-ended. I don't know if it's going to be at a straight line, but it's probably going to be closer to a continued quarterly reduction, like we've shown for the last couple of quarters, than anything else. Though again, I'd highlight that we could have some seasonal impacts. But the important thing, Matt, is you shouldn't expect the expenses to be flat and then all of a sudden, we'll just have a big drop in the fourth quarter next year. We're going to continue each quarter to reduce our expenses and work hard at doing that.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "And any related restructuring charges that we should expect?", "Timothy Sloan", "Not anything that's abnormal, no.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then just different topic. Among the regional and super regional banks, you have a bigger delta between your Basel I and Basel III capital ratios. I think it's about 1.8 % or so. One, can you remind us why there is such a big difference? I think part of it is deductions and part of it's the RWA inflation. And then two, what are some of the opportunities you have to narrow that 1.8% gap?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes. Matt, I'll take you at your word that it's about 1.8%. But the way that we think about it is that historically, Wells Fargo has always felt that it's important to have adequate capital. That's one of the reasons why we got through the downturn as well as we did. So we've been competing against the regional banks, other smaller regional banks with more capital. And we don't believe that's a big issue. I think that the difference is specifically between our sheet, and each bank is just going to be kind of bank by bank.", "John Stumpf", "Matt, I'm little confused. I thought the big banks we compete with have a bigger delta between I and III, but...", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "No, I'm sorry. I meant versus other regional. I guess I tend to think about you...", "John Stumpf", "No. On the regional side, I get it. But surely, not on the big side.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Right. So your gap is less, but I think all things else being equal, you'd like it to be even less than it is...", "John Stumpf", "Yes. Less is good in this case.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "So are there opportunities to...", "John Stumpf", "If there -- we're always looking at that, but we're not going to do anything stupid or anything that doesn't make business sense. I don't worry about us getting to whatever our number will be. We're growing capital very quickly now, and we're going to do the right thing for the business and for our customers. And I wouldn't do something different just because I'm trying to figure out some way to narrow that gap or that we have a challenge getting to that number.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then just lastly, it's a little bit of an annoying, an accounting question on the accretable yield. But on Page 32, you showed the accretable yield balance coming down by about $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion, the weighted average life increasing. And I'm just trying to understand what drove both the accretable yield balance down much more than the accretion that came into earnings, and then why the average life. I assume it's related, but why that increased?", "Timothy Sloan", "You're right, Matt. When you look at the PCI accretable yield, it was down about $1 billion from the first to the second quarter. About half of that was reduction -- was the normal accretion which we recognized in NII this quarter. The other half was due to a decline in our expected cash flows. This decline was driven by, primarily by Pick-a-Pay. Again, we'll call these our lifetime estimates. We update these quarterly. They can be affected by interest rates, liquidation timing, loan modification activity. I think the important thing to remember is that the projected accretion is still significantly better than we had at acquisition. At acquisition, we thought this would be about $10.4 billion. We're at $14.9 billion this quarter. So even after netting out the $6.1 billion of accretion we've recognized since the merger, we're still higher.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "And the pace that, that accretes into earnings, we can think about the remaining balance of roughly $13 billion. That's 10 years, so it's going to be with us at a similar pace more or less for quite some time?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes. It's been pretty steady, so I think that's a fair way to look at it, Matt.", "John Stumpf", "Good way of thinking of it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Market.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "There's been a lot of stuff -- earnings out as far as I'm all over the place. But did you address the loan demand? And also especially like, I think you had a big drive this year to drive small business loans. And I wonder, can you give us an update on that?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes. We did address loan demand. Our loans were up sequentially from the first to the second quarter by $766 million. The core loan portfolio grew $5.8 billion from the first quarter. The loan growth was strongest in our commercial portfolio at $7.5 billion, which is up about 2% from the quarter. And then the runoff of the liquidating portfolio was down about $5 billion. And one of the areas that we grew -- I think we got an award actually, in the second quarter for the SBA who is our small business area. And those loans were up. Small business or SBA.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "There's been a couple banks out there saying that in mid-May, they saw loan demand kind of dry up due to some of the headlines from the debt ceiling talks in overseas. Have you seen loan demand consistent throughout the quarter and even into July?", "Timothy Sloan", "We saw loan demand consistent throughout the quarter. Overall. Every area is going to be a little different, but overall loan demand was pretty consistent. And I think that just -- that reflects the balance of our diversified model. We're not dependent on one specific area, which is pretty exciting.", "John Stumpf", "Not only -- but also by geography.", "Timothy Sloan", "By geography too.", "John Stumpf", "Yes. And by product type.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "So did you see consistent across geography? Was there certain areas that you saw better loan demand than others?", "John Stumpf", "It's not necessarily by geography different, but surely, difference based on the kind of business it is. Those who have commodities that they're selling, as commodity prices go up or down, you'll see more inventory financing. Agriculture, we're the largest U.S. lender to agriculture and people putting crops in and doing things and buying fertilizer, we're financing. That's just more, I would say, business-specific or industry-specific as opposed to geography-specific.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I just wanted to follow up on the capital discussion. I mean, we are expecting to get some word this week out of the Basel committee on how they define global systemically important companies. I'm wondering, any thoughts in terms of where Wells falls into that? Your thoughts on that, number one. And number two, with 7.4% Tier 1 common under Basel III, that looks quite healthy relative to the 7%. Should we expect continued capital accumulation in the next year or 2, or can we expect that to level off at some point?", "Timothy Sloan", "Fred, we did get more information since the last call. And now the beta ask [ph] seems to be between the 1% and 2.5%. And they also shared, as you've all read, some of the criteria that gets you closer to the 1% or closer to 2.5% based on size, interconnectedness, complexity. On some of those measures, we don't even hit the scale. We're so -- whatever the opposite of interconnected is, not connected and not complex. So we've not been told our number, and we'll know more as you'll know more. But my expectation is that whatever the number is, I'm expecting it to be in the low to moderate side. And whatever you add that to the 7%, I just don't see this is an issue for us, as I mentioned in my comments. And we can't wait here to return more capital to our shareholders, our very loyal stockholders for a long time. And if you think of the kind of earnings we have today and the capital accumulation. I mean, you can just do your own math. This is just not a big issue for us as I see it today.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Great, okay. And just on that, John, once we get those numbers, would you like to operate any kind of strategic sense of where you'd like to operate, how much of above that or pretty close to it?", "John Stumpf", "Wells Fargo has always had this bias and view of strong capital. We even did that before Basel -- I even knew where Basel was or anything about the accords. And that's the history of the company, and what it gives you is the financial flexibility to do a Wachovia or do strategic things that really are important at a time when that capital really matters then. But we'll have to see what the numbers are and what the rules are and how it all comes down. So it's a little too early to comment on that. But again, just we've got another 6 quarters or so before the start of 2013, and I just don't see this as a big issue.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "And just one more in terms of the loan growth, one thing I don't think you've talked about too much was credit cards. It looks like you got some pretty good fee growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. It's still a relatively small portfolio compared to your peers. Any color on that, portfolio or opportunities?", "Timothy Sloan", "Sure. So we have something in the range of 28 million plus retail checking accounts, and the penetration of credit cards in the East is about 14.5% of our retail checking accounts have a credit card. It's 2.5 or 3x more than that on the West. We think there's huge opportunity here. And I can't wait to get a credit card in every one of our customers, our credit-worthy customers' wallets. And not only get in there, to be the dominant card or the primary card. So I think there's huge organic opportunity here. We like that business from a customer perspective, and not only for the transaction volume that they do. But it's a good -- it's another payments product. So we think there's big opportunity. And again, we're growing checking accounts also very quickly. So as we're catching the train, the train is also moving here, which is a good thing. Net checking accounts are up, on the retail side, 7% year-over-year. Those are big numbers because it's off a big base.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Could you expand a little bit in terms of your earlier comments, John, about capital deployment and how you see kind of the mix between further purchases of drops, stock buyback, you've done obviously some of both this quarter, and whether any acquisitions for cash also fit into that category?", "John Stumpf", "Okay. Again, so let's start with the idea that we like a strong capital position. It's part of our history. We have some instruments, some hybrids that are not going to fit into the capital regime going forward. And at an appropriate time, and it'll take a process, we will look to deal with those, eliminate some of those. And then the key will be how do you deploy your capital? And I think the first call on capital -- or one of the calls is to support the business. We think we're a growth business. And acquisitions are a part of that, but also organic growth is also part of it, adding people, adding distribution capabilities and so forth. I've said this publicly, the acquisitions that look most opportunistic or promising would be help build out our Wealth, Brokerage, Retirement area. We like that business a lot. We have opportunities to gain share there and have that share be more relative to the share we have in the business, compared to our deposit business. We have opportunities, I think, in the insurance distribution business. We could -- so there's just opportunities like that. With respect to -- and then the rest should be once you get to your numbers, should be returned to shareholders. It's their capital. It's your capital. And we'll do that through -- there's an annual process now to -- with our regulator. And then we'll also -- and part of that is dividends and part of that is stock repurchase, which we've done some in the first half of the year. And so you should expect that we have a strong bias to return capital to shareholders if we can't use it internally or don't need it.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Kind of on a separate question. When I think about that $125 million for the settlement, obviously, country-wide, there's something of an [indiscernible], but even just using their kind of loss expectations, we still would've come up with a higher number. Just can you talk a little bit about how that settlement was reached and what it encompasses?", "John Stumpf", "Well, I won't talk about how it was reached, but I'll talk about how it was -- first of all, think of that as securities. So you've got to separate reps and warranties kinds of settlements and litigation from securities law. This related to securities issues, and it's a settlement that involves most of the purchasers of those securities. You first have to think. So let's think about first of all, securities and then think about reps and warranties. But everything starts with the quality of the portfolio. So you go to Page 20 and look at that portfolio and look at the dichotomy, the differences. And remember, in our numbers, and the 7.2 is also some of the stuff that's on balance sheet. Pick-a-Pay, which is in that. So if you took that out, it'd even be a better number of what we sold. So how I think about the reps and warranties side, the portfolio is different than our competitors. Some of the riskiest or more problematic portfolios we have on balance sheet. And we've dealt with the rep and warranty cost through our PCI process. So we don't live that way. And in our $125 million, it's still a lot of money.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Just following up on Paul's questions, I guess. CNI balances in particular were up nicely from the first quarter. And I just wonder if you could talk more about what was driving that. Any particular businesses? Was it more kind of large corporate or middle market? Did you see line utilization tick up at all? And any comments just in general on the competitive environment.", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes, a good question. I think the first point is that we do not see much line utilization, which makes the growth that much more impressive from my perspective, that's number one. Number two, it was really broad based across the entire wholesale platform. We saw it in commercial banking, real estate, corporate banking, capital finance, asset-backed finance and international. So it was good that it wasn't just based upon line utilization, and it was great that it was broad based.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And then any comments on the competitive environment right now?", "Timothy Sloan", "You know what, it's competitive out there. I mean, it's always going to be competitive. I think that depending upon the business, it's probably a little bit more competitive than others. It's probably a bit more competitive at the high end in some of the large corporate when there's investment banking opportunities, but it's certainly a very reasonable environment. We like our chances in this environment, given how much we've grown customers over the last couple of years because we were there for people when things were a little bit tough.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Three questions for you. On the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, do you continue to try to convert those loans to a \"more normal\" type of amortizing loan? Can you just speak to sort of ongoing restructuring efforts in that portfolio?", "Timothy Sloan", "Absolutely. Yes. I mean, we're trying to, any time we have an opportunity to modify a loan on a makes-sense basis for a customer and for us, we're going to do it. And we'll continue to do that. I think that's one of the reasons why the portfolio continues to perform better than our initial expectations because we got at it very quickly.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "You have a sense of how -- I mean, at what point will that portfolio essentially disappear? I mean, is there still sort of a half life on it at this point?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, I would think of it that way. First of all let me just say, on the loans that have an option to them, about 56%. So less than 60% overall today has the Pay option, if you will. And that's down substantially from where it was when we started out. But some of these customers are -- these portfolios were built earlier. The average loan balance is in the 200 range for the ones that were not marked, if you will. And about 1,000 for the ones that were marked. So this will probably behave much like a real estate first mortgage portfolio as it is over time. So there will be a tail here.", "Timothy Sloan", "But it's a 10-year -- you should think about it as a 10-year portfolio, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Secondly, I know it's very early on in the expense reduction, of the Project Compass, days. But do you have any sense very roughly at this point, how much of the expense reductions are going to come from sort of frontline branch activities versus non-branch?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, most of it's -- very little going is going to come from frontline branch activity. And let me just go back, we've been working on Project Compass for a year. And one of the reasons why we started a year ago is because we wanted to make sure that it was a bottoms-up process. So it was focused on improving how our team members do their jobs and how they interact with our customers, right. It's not hard to reduce expenses at the expense of revenue, right. And we're just not going to do that. We want to continue to grow revenue during this time period. So when you think about Project Compass, I would think about in a reduction in merger integration expenses, we're nearing the tail end of the merger. It's costing us between $400 million and $500 million a quarter. Then you think about the reduction in loss mitigation expenses, and then it's going to come much more from staff and back-office type functions as opposed to the frontline. We want to continue to invest in our frontline bankers and stores as we've done in the East, in our relationship managers in wholesale and our financial advisors in Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement to take advantage of the opportunities we have out there.", "John Stumpf", "Nancy, I've been convinced for 25 years now that distribution matters. And we were convinced that when people were saying it didn't matter and it wouldn't be around anymore. And now you're having people -- then, everybody said this was just mere [ph], and now you're kind of getting some saying it doesn't [indiscernible]. We think it does. And you should expect more stores, net stores, we're still opening stores. And you should expect more people in the stores in the East. I mean, that's -- we wouldn't be growing the accounts that we are without it. So now that does not mean the store make up might not change. We continue to innovate. I mean today, we have about 5 billion retail transactions a year. And 2.5 billion, half of those, are online. Another 300 million or 400 million are on mobiles. I mean, so we continue to innovate and change. In the store design make up, what we do there, we continue to think about that. But distribution matters big-time.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "And finally, just Tim, do have an estimate of the tangible book value per share for Wells Fargo? I know that's a metric you guys don't think that much about or really present that much, but do you have the number? And if so, can you just kind of walk us through how you come up with it?", "Timothy Sloan", "You know what Nancy, Jim will give you a call on that.", "John Stumpf", "We're so interested in Basel, we don't think of that.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Well, unfortunately, the market still does from time to time.", "John Stumpf", "Seriously, we'll get you that number. And I don't have it at the top. I mean, I...", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Christopher Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Two quick questions. Do your litigation reserves take into account the civil money penalties that could be coming about from the federal regulators and/or the AG settlements that may be coming?", "John Stumpf", "It's the best estimate we have for everything we know today.", "Christopher Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, John, my fear is that the AGs will look at the penalties or fines, whatever they want to do, and they'll prorate it based on originations or based on servicing book and not based on the quality of the servicing book, which you showed in your slides, is much better than others. Is my fear justified? And if it is justified, do you balk and take your chances in court?", "John Stumpf", "I think what we should think about that is that our portfolio is different from others. And we're very proud of the prudence we had. We didn't do everything right, but the prudence we had. And we tell the Wells Fargo story in plain English when we have those kind of discussions.", "Christopher Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Are they listening?", "John Stumpf", "We say it in plain English.

Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thanks, Jim. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We produced record results in the third quarter despite a choppy economic environment as we continue to execute Wells Fargo's diversified business model which has guided us for decades. ", "Our diversified businesses generated record net income of $4.1 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 21% from a year ago, and a record EPS of $0.72, an increase of 20% from a year ago. Our focus on meeting our customers' financial needs led to robust deposit growth and our strongest quarterly loan growth since our merger with Wachovia almost 3 years ago. We also benefited this quarter from lower expenses and continued improvement in credit quality. ", "As the economic environment and recovery remains uneven, Wells Fargo has not wavered from our commitment to do all we can to help our customers and the overall economy. For example, we remain committed to helping homeowners stay in their homes. Since 2009, we have hosted 40 preservation workshops, opened 27 home preservation centers, initiated over 716,000 active trial or completed mortgage modifications. ", "Within our Pick-a-Pay portfolio alone, we have forgiven over $4 billion of principal since we acquired this portfolio from Wachovia and modified approximately 1/3 of our total Pick-a-Pay loans as we strive to give customers an affordable, sustainable payment. ", "We are also lending, providing companies with funds to invest for growth and job creation. As the #1 small business lender for 9 consecutive years, we are committed to helping small businesses succeed by actively lending. During the first 3 quarters of this year, we made over $10 billion in new loan commitments to our small business customers, an 8% increase from a year ago. ", "We are also the #1 lender to middle-sized companies, and we've grown loans to middle market commercial customers for 14 straight months. And we continue to lend throughout our businesses, both commercial and consumer, with our core loan portfolio growing by $13.5 billion in the third quarter alone. ", "In addition to serving the financial needs of our business and individual customers every day, we also strengthen our communities in many other ways. Wells Fargo employs 1 in every 500 Americans. And last year, we contributed $219 million to 19,000 nonprofits across U.S., making us America's third most generous cash donor according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy. ", "Our team members throughout the country are active volunteers in the communities where they live and work, volunteering a total of over 900,000 hours during the first 9 months of this year alone. We know that with each community's success comes our success. ", "I also want to highlight a very important milestone that occurred this past weekend. We completed our last retail banking state conversion, North Carolina. With all our banking stores in the U.S. operating under the Wells Fargo brand, I believe we now have the best leadership team, the best products and services and the best distribution system we've ever had at Wells Fargo. ", "Our successful integration reflects an incredible effort made by our entire team. Since we first started working to integrate Wachovia almost 3 years ago, we've converted over 3,000 Wachovia retail banking stores and more than 38 million customer accounts, including mortgage, deposits, trust, brokerage and credit cards onto one common platform. While the effort required to convert Wachovia stores and millions of accounts was tremendous, the real measure of success will be our ability to retain and grow customer relationships in the East and throughout our franchise going forward as One Wells Fargo. ", "A cornerstone of those relationships and one of the most valuable parts of our franchise is our ability to attract and retain core deposits. Since the merger with Wachovia, we have grown checking and savings accounts by -- deposits by $185 billion. That's just in 3 years. We achieved this growth through building relationships with customers, not pricing. In fact, our average deposit costs were only 25 basis points in the third quarter. So with the Wachovia integration nearing successful completion, we remain focused on Wells Fargo's time-tested formula for success, an unwavering focus on helping our customers succeed financially. By focusing on our opportunities to better serve our customers and grow our businesses, Wells Fargo has never been better positioned for future growth. ", "Let me now turn this over to Tim for more detail on our financial results. Tim?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks, which will take approximately 20 minutes, will follow the presentation included in the first half of the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then take your questions. ", "As John highlighted, we had record earnings of $4.1 billion in the third quarter, up 3% from the second quarter and 21% from a year ago. And we achieved record EPS of $0.72, also up 3% from last quarter and 20% from a year ago. ", "During a continued period of economic volatility, our diversified model has performed for our shareholders, with 4 consecutive quarters of earning asset growth and 7 consecutive quarters of EPS growth. It is important to note that while our total revenue was down $758 million compared with the second quarter, half of this decline was from items that are relatively neutral to the bottom line, lower deferred compensation plan investment results and seasonally lower insurance, which have offsets in expenses, and the rest of the decline is due to lower equity gains. ", "Our pretax pre-provision profit increased slightly in the quarter to $8 billion. Our ROA remained strong at 1.26%, and our ROE was 11.86%, up almost 100 basis points from a year ago. These results generated strong internal capital growth, producing an estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under current Basel III capital proposals of 7.4%. We remain focused on meeting the required capital levels once Basel III is finalized while returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. ", "On Page 3, we highlight our diversified business model, our results this quarter and the business momentum we see ahead derived from our basic banking strategy and the diversity of our businesses. This is a major differentiator for Wells Fargo. ", "In the third quarter, we remained balanced between consumer and commercial loans and fee and spread income, and our sources of fee income were broadly diversified. Each quarter is different in terms of which customer segments or businesses drive results. But as we've demonstrated through many different economic environments, our business model provides us with a tested ability to perform over time and through cycles. It is also important to note that our performance has not come at the expense of risk discipline as we believe we maintain one of the lowest risk profiles in our industry. ", "Let me take a minute upfront to highlight some of the key business drivers this quarter, and I'll follow up with more detail later in my remarks. ", "Starting with the balance sheet. We generated strong loan growth this quarter, with our core loan portfolio up $13.5 billion or 2% from the second quarter, which excludes the expected $5.3 billion runoff from a liquidating portfolio. By staying consistent and serving customers when the market were soft, we're now benefiting from the relationships that we've developed over the last few years. ", "We also actively deployed some of our liquidity this quarter, with our securities portfolio increasing $20.9 billion as we increase purchase activity. We also generated exceptionally strong deposit growth with balances up $41.8 billion, driven by a flight to quality and new account growth. This strong deposit growth was the primary driver behind the decline in the NIM this quarter, accounting for about 70% of the change from the second quarter but with slightly positive to net interest income. ", "We also lowered our other funding costs by reducing long-term debt by $9.7 billion, and we called $5.8 billion of high-cost trust preferred securities in the third quarter, which were redeemed earlier this month. This redemption will benefit net interest income and NIM starting in the fourth quarter. ", "Let me now turn to the income statement. Net interest income was down $136 million as balance sheet repricing and lower variable income was partially offset by growth in loans, securities and the mortgage warehouse, as well as one extra day in the quarter. ", "Turning to the fee side, we had revenue growth in many of our businesses, including an increase of over $200 million in mortgage banking. If you isolate our revenue items that are market-sensitive, trading, debt and equity gains, these 3 items again generated positive results, $202 million of revenue this quarter. The linked quarter decline in market-sensitive revenue of $808 million was due to 4 factors. ", "First, as I've mentioned, equity gains declined  $380 million from very strong second quarter equity investment business results. Second, trading losses included a $234 million linked-quarter decline in deferred compensation plan investment results, which reduced employee benefits' expense by approximately the same amount, so no overall impact to the bottom line. Third, a loss and a gain on resolving 2 legacy Wachovia positions partially offset one another but reduced market-sensitive revenue by $106 million. And finally, customer-driven trading results were down $108 million from the second quarter on weaker market conditions. ", "Noninterest expense declined $798 million from the second quarter, which included the $235 million redemption from deferred compensation. The linked-quarter decline was also driven by $108 million in lower merger integration expenses and $230 million in lower operating losses reflecting lower litigation accruals. ", "Let me now cover our results in more detail. As shown on Page 6, period-end loans were up $8.2 billion from the second quarter, reflecting our commitment to our commercial and retail customers through this period of economic uncertainty. Most of this growth came near the end of the quarter, and therefore, our average loans were up just $3.3 billion. Loan growth was once again driven by our commercial portfolio, which grew $9.1 billion or 3% from the second quarter and was diverse across our commercial businesses. This growth also reflects our ability to capitalize on the opportunities generated in the business environment, including the purchase of $1.1 billion in loans from the Bank of Ireland, which were all U.S.-based and largely all commercial real estate. Excluding the runoff of $4.5 billion of liquidating consumer loans, core consumer loans grew $3.5 billion. Loans grew in a number of consumer portfolios, including mortgage, core auto, credit card and private student lending. The runoff of the liquidating portfolio continued as expected, down $5.3 billion from the second quarter and down $74 billion or 39% since the Wachovia merger. ", "As I mentioned earlier, deposit growth was exceptionally strong this quarter, driven by both the flight to quality and new account growth. Average core deposits were up $29.4 billion from the second quarter and up $64.9 billion or 8% from a year ago and were 111% of average loans. Average core checking and savings deposits were $769 billion, up 12% from a year ago and were 92% of average core deposits. Consumer checking accounts were up 5.6% from a year ago, and we experienced strong growth throughout our markets, including 7% growth in California and 9.8% growth in North Carolina. ", "We continue to be effective in lowering funding costs, with average deposit cost declining 25 basis points, down 3 basis points from the second quarter and 10 basis points from a year ago, evidence that we still have the ability to reprice deposits even in this low rate environment. This strong deposit growth will benefit Wells Fargo over time as we grow our relationship with new customers and use these deposits to fund future loan and securities growth. But as I mentioned earlier, this growth was diluted to NIM this quarter, which is why we've always said we don't manage to the NIM. Our goal is to generate more business from our existing customers and grow our customer base, and that may increase or decrease NIM in any given quarter. Instead, we manage our business with a focus on net interest income, and this is how we return value to our shareholders. Our net interest income declined $137 million from the second quarter. Let me highlight the drivers on Page 8. ", "First, lower income from balance sheet repricing, which was partially offset by growth in loans, securities and the mortgage warehouse, and while the expected runoff of our liquidating loans, which had a weighted average yield of 5.61%, puts downward pressure on net interest income, these loans generally have higher charge-offs and cost more to service. Second, we had lower income from variable sources, including loan prepayments and resolutions. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of an extra day in the quarter. ", "Let me continue the discussion of net interest income on Page 9. NIM and net interest income do not necessarily move in sync, and this quarter was a great example of that. The deposit growth we had this quarter actually had a small positive impact to net interest income of $13 million but was diluted -- but diluted our NIM by 12 basis points. Growing net interest income remains our focus, and the size and mix of earning assets are keys to achieving that goal. The available-for-sale portfolio has grown by over $39 billion in the last 2 quarters, and loans outstanding have grown nearly $9 billion despite the continued runoff of the liquidating portfolio. The mortgage warehouse grew by $11.5 billion in the third quarter, benefiting from the current refi wave. ", "While earning asset growth is the primary driver of net interest income growth, our liability mix also influences our net interest income trends. The benefit from the redemption of $5.8 billion of TRUPs will begin in the fourth quarter, and the long-term debt outstanding was down $9.7 billion in the third quarter, with an additional $9 billion maturing in the fourth quarter. Obviously, 3 of the biggest drivers of net interest income over time are the size and mix of our securities and loan portfolios and our funding cost. Over the course of 2011, these have all moved in the right direction, and we feel confident that, that trend will continue. ", "Noninterest income was down $622 million from the second quarter, driven by the $808 million linked-quarter decline in market-sensitive revenue that I highlighted earlier. Trust and investment fees declined $158 million from the second quarter on lower brokerage transaction activity and weaker investment banking. We generated linked-quarter growth in deposit service charges, card fees, other fees, including charges and fees on loans, mortgage banking and operating leases. ", "Mortgage banking revenue was up $214 million or 13% from the second quarter. Originations increased $25 billion or 39% from the second quarter, and application volume rose $60 billion or 55% during the quarter. The unclosed mortgage pipeline increased $33 billion to $84 billion at the end of the quarter. This is one of the largest pipelines we've had since the merger. ", "As it relates to revenue, it is important to note we fair value our interest rate locks at the time of commitment, but we recognize the majority of our gain at the time of funding. Therefore, the increase in applications in the third quarter should benefit fourth quarter revenue. ", "As a reminder, last quarter, we provided an update on the impact of Federal Reserve rules regarding debit interchange fees. Our estimate is unchanged. And starting in the fourth quarter, we estimate these lower fees will reduce earnings by approximately $250 million quarterly after tax before any offsets. We expect to recapture at least half of this over time through volume and product changes. ", "Noninterest expense declined $798 million or 6% from the second quarter. The large linked-quarter decline was driven by few significant items. $384 million decline in employee benefit expense, this is where the $235 million decline in deferred compensation is reflected, which was an offset in trading revenue. Merger integration costs was $376 million, down $108 million from the second quarter. We had a $198 million of operating losses, down $230 million, driven by lower litigation accruals. We had a $107 million decline in insurance expenses due to seasonally lower crop insurance, which also reduced insurance revenues. ", "While we had strong reductions in expenses this quarter, as we've said previously, noninterest expense trends will vary from quarter to quarter, but we are still targeting noninterest expense of $11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. ", "For example, in the fourth quarter of this year, we expect expenses to be higher than the third quarter, driven by higher mortgage expenses as we had team members to capture increased revenue opportunities driven by refinance activity. We also expect higher merger integration costs, and we typically have seasonally higher fourth quarter expenses in a number of areas. Also, as we said last quarter, when we provided our expense target, we will continue to invest in our businesses and add team members where appropriate. We expect to continue to have positive operating leverage and recognize savings as Project Compass is executed over the next 5 quarters. ", "Turning briefly to our segment results starting on Page 13. Community Banking earned $2.3 billion, up 11% from the second quarter, driven by stronger mortgage banking revenue. Sales trends remain strong. Core product sales in the West were $8.8 million, up 15% from the prior year, and core product sales in the East continue to grow by double digits. ", "Retail banking cross-sell continued to grow to a record 5.91 products per household, up from 5.68 a year ago. Cross-sell in the East was 5.39, up from 5.10 a year ago. The majority of our retail banking markets in the East were already converted by the third quarter, which helped to accelerate cross-sell growth in these markets. The East is also benefiting from more than 1,000 incremental platform banker FTEs added over the past year, a 10% increase. ", "Wholesale Banking earned $1.8 billion, down 6% from the second quarter, driven by a 9% decline in revenue. The decline in revenue was driven by lower capital markets, trading and resolution income and seasonally lower insurance. However, most other businesses grew revenue, such as commercial banking, government banking, capital finance, asset-backed finance and international. ", "Wholesale Banking continued to generate strong broad-based loan growth from both new and existing customers, with average loans up 4% from the second quarter. This growth occurred in almost all portfolios, including commercial banking, international, commercial real estate, capital finance, asset-backed finance, government banking and corporate banking. ", "Average core deposits increased $19 billion from the second quarter, up 10%, our largest quarterly increase since the merger with Wachovia. This growth reflects a combination of a flight to quality and the fact that our commercial customers are holding more liquidity. ", "Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $291 million, down 13% from the second quarter, driven by lower securities gains and reduced brokerage transaction revenue, reflecting the lower market activity, while credit quality continued to improve, driving loan losses lower. Average loans were stable from the second quarter, with growth in brokerage-originated loans. Average core deposits increased $7.4 billion, up 6% from the second quarter, reflecting both a flight to quality and our continued success in attracting client assets, including deposits. ", "Managed account asset net flows remained strong despite market volatility. Asset levels were down 9% from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of the market decline. Our continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs is reflected in achieving an average cross-sell ratio of 10 products per WBR household. ", "Credit quality continued to improve as shown on Page 17. We are very pleased with how our loan portfolios are performing. Charge-offs declined for the seventh consecutive quarter, down $227 million from the second quarter, 52% below the peak in the fourth quarter of 2009. While we continue to see positive trends in credit performance, the rate of improvement moderated at some portfolios in the quarter as expected at this point in the credit cycle. Provision expense was $1.8 billion, down $27 million from the second quarter, including an $800 million reserve release. Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we expect future reserve releases. ", "Other credit metrics showed continued improvement also. Nonperforming assets were down $1.1 billion from the second quarter, reflecting lower inflows of commercial nonaccrual loans. Early-stage delinquency balances were down modestly, while delinquency rates were stable. ", "The past few quarters, I've discussed the quality of our mortgage servicing portfolio and why we believe it is among the best in the industry, so I won't go into a lot of detail here. But since the risks associated with mortgage servicing are still important to investors, let me highlight just a few key items starting on Page 19. ", "The majority of our $1.8 trillion residential servicing portfolio or 69% is service for the agencies, and only 6% are private securitizations where we originated the loans. Reflecting the quality of our portfolio, our delinquency and foreclosure rate is over 400 basis points lower than the industry average, excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recent publicly available data. Wells Fargo's total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 7.63% in the third quarter, down from a peak of 8.96% in the fourth quarter but up modestly from the second quarter due to seasonality. Losses on repurchases were up $123 million in the quarter, but total demands outstanding were down in both number and balances for the fifth consecutive quarter and down approximately 50% from the third quarter of last year. We added $390 million to the repurchased reserve this quarter, up $148 million from the second quarter primarily due to an increase in demands from Fannie Mae on 2006 through 2008 vintage loans. Demands from Freddie Mac continue to be consistent with our expectations. ", "As shown on Page 21, our strong internal capital generation continued, and capital ratios grew. Tier 1 common equity ratio increased to 9.35%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter and up 134 basis points from a year ago. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under current Basel III proposals grew to 7.4% this quarter. $5.8 billion of trust preferreds were redeemed earlier this month with a weighted average coupon of 8.45%. This redemption reduced our Tier 1 capital ratio in the third quarter, but the benefit to net interest income and NIM will begin in the fourth quarter. ", "We repurchased 22 million shares in the third quarter and an additional estimated 6 million shares through a forward repurchase transaction that will settle in the fourth quarter of 2011. We plan to continue to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter pursuant to our capital plan. ", "In summary, our diversified business model continued to produce record results this quarter, with earnings up 21% from a year ago. In the quarter, we saw continued growth in earning assets, loans, securities, deposits and capital. Many individual businesses, both consumer and commercial, generated revenue and loan growth. ", "By focusing on meeting our customers' financial needs, we continued to generate very strong deposit growth and had the largest linked-quarter increase in loans in 11 quarters. And based on current business trends, we expect loan growth to continue. ", "We remain focused on our efforts targeting $11 billion in quarterly noninterest expense by the fourth quarter of 2012. However, next quarter, we expect higher expenses driven by strong mortgage origination volumes, which will also benefit revenue, higher merger expenses and typical fourth quarter seasonality. ", "During the first 9 months of this year, we've grown our securities portfolio by $35 billion in loans, excluding the expected runoff, were up by $20 billion. Deposits have increased $47 billion. Long-term debt is down $24 billion, and we've redeemed 9 billion of TRUPs. Clearly, we have positioned our balance sheet very well for growth. With the completion of the conversion of Wachovia banking stores this weekend, we are very optimistic about the growth opportunities we have throughout our company operating as One Wells Fargo. I will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford C. Bernstein.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Tim, a question on the net interest income and the margin. So first, I guess, of the 17 basis point drop, you've mentioned 12 of it are due to deposits. What were the other 5? What would you say that was driven by?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "You know what, John, it was a mix across a number of factors. None of them really stood out. It was the 5 basis point decline which really wasn't that significant.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And can you give us any feel for how much benefit you expect to get from the TRUPs retirement?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, just at the margin, John, you can take the 845 basis points and subtract it from a marginal cost of forms, which, this quarter, was 25 basis points. And then you can annualize that, so it's pretty significant. It's over $200 million, I think, after tax a year.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of additional TRUPs, could you remind us what you have left and if some of that is still something that you'd consider calling?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, John, we've got to move forward with our capital plan for next year, and we've got a plan in terms of calling the TRUPs. But in terms of specifically which TRUPs we'll call and when we're going to call, I prefer not to be specific about that right now. But as we did this quarter, we're going to continue to be as aggressive as we can be in redeeming TRUPs pursuant to their terms as quickly as we can given the cost of those TRUPs and the fact that they're not added at the capital any longer.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then just back on the margin and the $42 billion of the deposit inflow and that getting invested into a low-yielding securities, what kind of stuff are you investing this deposit flow into, and where can we look on the balance sheet to see these growing low-yielding asset accounts?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, John, I didn't say they were going  into low-yielding. I think they're going into securities. First, we want them to go into loans, right? And again, we're very pleased with the loan growth that we had in the second quarter, and we feel poised for continued loan growth in the fourth quarter as it relates to the types of securities. And we go through our standard quarterly process. We look at what we think provides a good risk/return, but it was a mix from shorter-term and high-quality securities all the way to medium-term as well as kind of longer-term securities. So it's a mix. There wasn't anything in particular. It's just across all the categories in the statement.", "John G. Stumpf", "John, maybe I can just give you my sense. The way I think about NIM is, as Tim mentioned, we don't run the company around the NIM. We never have. We really run it around trying to add long-term shareholder value, and we think we can do that best by serving individuals and companies completely and deeply. And the things that we can manage, like loan growth and deposit growth and more customers and deeper relationships, we're doing those sorts of things. Because it's an unusual rate environment today, some of that, you don't get paid for right away. And we are making investments, and we had the best loan growth we've had in -- frankly, since the merger. And when we look at securities, we look at safety, quality. We look at the duration and all those things. And because of our strong deposit growth, we still are a very liquid company, but we continue to make investments as we see opportunistic opportunities.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. Thanks, John. And one quick follow-up, just on capital return. John, maybe you can comment on this. Do you -- what is your hope in terms of next year's capital return into the buybacks and dividends? Do you hope to do more than you did this year in buybacks and dividends? And do you know the rules yet on that the Fed will hold you to in terms of 2012 capital distributions?", "John G. Stumpf", "The answer is, I think, yes and no. So let me take the last question first. We don't know what the SIFI reserve or the buffer is going to be. We hope to hear sometime in the fourth quarter. And you're right. We have the annual plan coming up soon, our capital plan that we will discuss with our regulators. And we have stated publicly that -- I've stated publicly, and I think we've also -- you've seen it in Tim's comments and other things that we've written that we want to return more capital to our shareholders. And I don't want to get into specifics because the plan is just being developed now. But I'm confident that given where we are today in the absolute number, we're at 7.4% Tier 1 common, Basel to the third degree. And we're not that -- when you look at the risk profile of the company, it's not on -- we're not global. We don't have a lot of the risks that others do. And on top of that, we're generating just lots of internal capital. So you put all that together, and that's why I just don't worry about that. And I want to get as much back to shareholders as fast as we can. And dividends are an important part of it, let me just say that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "You mentioned, Tim, much of the loan growth came late in the quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about how customer sentiment evolved over the quarter and if you're seeing more confidence there recently. And also, maybe comment on kind of the risk-adjusted return opportunities you're seeing in the CRE area right now and competitive environment as well.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, it seems like a long time ago, but there was a lot of volatility in the third quarter. If you remember, some of the things we watched on television in late July, and then obviously, there was a lot of concern and there still is about what's going on in Europe. I think generally, when you look at our customer base, customer sentiment is good. The economy continues to kind of bump along a little bit, but the customer sentiment is good. And as I said and will reiterate, we feel good about loan growth in the quarter. And I think one of the reasons why we feel good about it is that it's really broad-based. As I mentioned and gave some examples in terms of loan growth both in our commercial or our wholesale and our consumer portfolios. It's 7, 8, 9, 10 businesses that are growing loans across the board. It's not concentrated anywhere. It's not one industry. It's not one geography, so we're feeling good about that. And as it relates to CRE, I think that the fact that we stayed consistent in that business over the cycle, which was very difficult at times for the commercial real estate business, is really paying dividends right now. We're the largest commercial real estate lender in the country. There's lots of opportunities to help our existing customers to refinance their existing loans as they buy new properties. We can provide capital to them. And then also, as the CMBS market continues to mature and refinance, there's opportunities there. So overall, the commercial real estate business and the risk-adjusted returns there are pretty attractive.", "John G. Stumpf", "And also, Joe, as you noticed or you've probably read that we were able to buy some loans on opportunistic basis from some international competitors that are getting out of the U.S. market.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, that's great and helpful. I guess just one follow-up to John's question. The buyback was a bit less this quarter despite the recent drop in the stock over the period, and I guess any comments on that as part of your overall capital deployment plan.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, Joe, that's a real fair question. I think that when you think about our capital plan, what you got to think about it being a very balanced plan, right? And it's true that we bought back fewer shares of stock in the third quarter than we did in the second, but on the other hand, we also retired some pretty high-cost TRUPs. And to reiterate, we continue or we plan to continue to buy back shares this quarter. Again, we have a very measured and balanced plan that we want to execute to, and we think by doing that, it'll create some dividends as we go into the next capital planning cycle.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a couple follow-up questions on the NIM and just looking for the average balance you have on your supplement. Looking at things like commercial and industrial loans, which had deals come down pretty significantly, and I just wanted to understand how much of that was driven by just the repricing that you have within the C&I loan book because LIBOR came down, or is that more net new borrowers coming on the balance sheet and you being competitive on pricing?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, I think, Betsy, it wasn't any one specific category, but it's a combination of some one-timers that we had in the second quarter versus the third quarter. It also included some repricing in the existing book and then new loans on, but it wasn't really any one specific item.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And when we think about that loan yield going forward, I mean, a lot of that book is priced off of floating LIBOR, either 1 month, 3 months or what have you. Is it pretty much repriced at this stage, or is there more to do?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, there's generally a little bit of a lag so that we've seen LIBOR start to tick up a little bit this month, which should have a bit of a benefit. But there's about a 1-month to 2-month lag on average.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And when you think about the TRUPs that you called in the quarter, in the third quarter, how much of an impact is that going to have on your NIM in fourth quarter?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Off the top of my head, I don't know. Let us get back to you on that, Betsy. I'd be guessing right now, but we'll get back to you.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, on incremental loans that you're interested in buying from folks that are exiting portfolios. I mean, how much risk are you looking to take onto the balance sheet? Are you only going to be playing in the higher investment-grade type of securities or in loans, or are you willing to go into securities or loans that might be a little bit more costly from a capital perspective?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I think it's really going to be a function of, one, what's available; and then two, we've got to -- even though there's a lot of opportunity to buy securities and loans today, we've got to be continued to be really measured and follow the risk discipline that we've had for years. And so a long answer to your question, but the point is I think we're going to buy across the spectrum as long as we're comfortable with the risk-adjusted returns. Sometimes, the pricing is attractive at the high end and sometimes, at the low end. There are a lot of securities and loans that are available today. And I think this is really reflective of what is strong about Wells Fargo, and that is this is the time in the cycle that because we had a risk discipline over the years in place, we've got the opportunity to be a buyer today.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes, Betsy, let me add to that, and I appreciate that question because I think you know us well enough. We don't feel any sense of urgency to have to do something that does not make sense here. I mean, we're looking for value, and the ones we bought in this last group happened to be the higher end and the more investment-grade, names that we knew, many customers we already had something out to. But even though revenue was challenged this quarter, I feel and our team feels no sense of improper urgency to do something that does not make sense for this company. We just will not do that.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Would you prioritize growing the common Tier 1 ratio under Basel III or prioritizing earnings?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, I don't know that. First of all, I would say that the #1 priority is to develop more long-term, profitable customer relationships. That's what we get up in the morning to do. And the result of that is we make money, and when you make money, you grow your capital. Again, when John asked a question about the Tier 1 common Basel III, we're already at 7.4%. I don't know what the buffer will be. As I said before, the bidding assets are between 1% and 2.5%. We are clearly on the low end or to the left if that makes it less risky. 7.4 is already 40 basis points over the minimum. And our capital generation, we're putting tons of capital on the balance sheet every quarter now, so I think it starts with relationships. From that, over time, you make money, and then you build capital.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, and just to add to that, Betsy, I don't think it's an either/or for us right now. We can do both, right? We can go out, and we can buy assets that are for sale with good, quality customers that we've appropriately underwritten. And we can make money doing that, and we can also grow capital. It's really not an either/or.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I guess as we think about mortgage in the fourth quarter, I mean, it would seem like gain on sale is going to be very high, if not actually at record levels, the percentage gain on sale for each loan. And I mean, is there any way to break apart how much of the expansion and gain on sale we've seen in this cycle is cyclical because of low rates, capacity constraints in the industry, et cetera, and how much of it you think is secular given a more consolidated industry mainly of banks and, hopefully, more rational pricing?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, you know what, Brian, I wish I was smart enough to know the answer to that question. I just don't. I mean, I think what we're seeing is a very attractive mortgage market. We worked long and hard to be the largest mortgage originator in the country, and we're well positioned. We've got a great team. We're seeing a lot of good volume, as we mentioned, going into the fourth quarter. But in terms of what percent of the margin is related to the industry and what percent is related to capacity, really, I don't know.", "John G. Stumpf", "Brian, I would make this comment. Part of the reason that we're able to capture more share today is related to the fact that we don't have a lot of problems in our exiting portfolio. I mean, 400 basis points less in terms of delinquencies and foreclosures, that's a lot. Especially when you service 9 million mortgages or so, that becomes a big, big number. So we've continued to invest in systems and in people and in training and compliance and outreach, and even during the big refi booms,  we never lost our interest or hunger in serving the purchase money markets. So what you're saying is right. I mean, they're good margins. We've got a great pipeline, and we're busy.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "If I could ask a follow-up, I guess, on the bad side of the mortgage business right now, on Page 28, you show $16.5 billion of FHA-insured guaranteed by the VA delinquent but still accruing loans. I guess just in the spirit of things having put-backs and litigation risks having extended further than most of us thought this cycle, is there anyway contractually that those loans, any part of those loans could become the responsibility of Wells Fargo?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Brian, we have not seen any change in our relationship with the FHA/VA. When a loan goes 90 days delinquent, it's put back on the balance sheet. We work through it. That's what happened this quarter. It happens every quarter. And then once we work through it, they honor their guarantee. We haven't seen any change in that relationship at all.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "I understand that you don't manage to the margin, but given how the interest rate environment will be seemingly suboptimal for longer, and I understand that you have taken steps to redeploy some of your liquidity already in the third quarter, what would you have to see to be a little bit more aggressive in moving down your cash balances?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, Erika, the first thing that -- the first call on liquidity, and I think Tim mentioned this, is to fund loans. And when you think about it, this quarter, we had $13.5 billion of core loan growth. That's a great quarter of loan growth, and that's because we're out serving customers. And I'm not going to predict what's going to happen in the fourth quarter. But our people are busy, and we're serving our retail household and the business households. And we're always looking at the market, and if we can get spreads that we think that are appropriate, recognizing that we're at record low levels. And we're not any better at market timing, so we're careful and cautious as we do that. And if you look at our cash balances, they are pretty much on top of where they were a quarter ago, even though we've made a fair amount of what we think high-quality, shorter-term investments along the way. You recognize one thing that we still don't know yet is the LCR, the liquidity coverage ratio, and that's important also. So we are, in a very balanced way, moving forward here.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "And do you have a sense from your conversations with Washington that there is a chance that the LCR in its final interpretation will likely get softened?", "John G. Stumpf", "I don't -- I'm not in the prediction business, especially when it comes to Washington. But I can tell you this, our team has been very active and responsive to the requests, so we could -- from Washington and other places to help them understand our view and the calibration and what happened during previous times with previous companies and so forth and what happened with deposit runoff and loan line takedowns during times of stress, so we think we have something to offer there.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And just one last follow-up question. I just wanted to ask one of Betsy's questions another way. I think a lot of investors were concerned about the C&I decline in terms of the yield, and I understand there's a lot of puts and takes in this line item. But if you look at your pipeline of new originations, and you've told us that loan growth prospects are quite strong, and you look at what's set to renew, I guess, should we see or should we expect a similar quarterly decline next quarter aside from the movements in LIBOR?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, we're too early in the quarter to be able to have any specific -- or give you a real specific answer to that question because we're going to have loans that aren't even in the pipeline right now. They're going to close toward the end of the year, so I don't know the answer to your question. The point is, I think from our perspective, is that loan growth is real strong right now.", "John G. Stumpf", "And think of it this way, Erika. A lot of loan growth we had in the third quarter didn't come until later in the quarter. We have some purchases that we've made that will close in the fourth quarter that have been announced. And a lot of what's happened in mortgage has not yet come through, so think of it in those terms.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Tim and John, just going back to the capital question. I understand that, Tim, you mentioned you have a very balanced, very measured approach in terms of your capital plan. But the thing about the 2012 CCAR program and the Fed process, it appears that, number one, the Fed is taking more active role in terms of determining the kind of the various scenarios for the program; and then two, it appears that the Feds are also taking a more conservative view as it relates to their concerns surrounding systemic capital risk. And as I look at your buyback, for example, and I listened to some of your competitors, how do you think about that 2012 program in terms of -- you mentioned the uncertainty in terms of the operating environment. You talked about the TRUPs potential. But how do we think about Wells Fargo being more or less aggressive with the plan going in the 2012 given your capital generation and what appears to be a heightened concern on the part of Fed with capital and buybacks?", "John G. Stumpf", "Say, Todd, let me just give you a sense before Tim talks about the numbers. The best thing we can do, the most aggressive thing we could do is serve our customers really, really well and produce great results and have a low risk profile for our company and have lots of capital generation internally. We do all those things well. We can achieve the kinds of things our shareholders want, i.e. returning capital to them as quickly as we can. And one of my biases is dividends. I don't know what we can -- well, if you can add something to that, Tim?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I think, Todd, we haven't seen any major change in terms of our relationship with the Fed in terms of how they're looking at this next CCAR process versus a year ago. And again, I would step back and put this into perspective. Think about what our balance sheet, what our earnings, what our capital level was a year ago at this time and then compare them to where we are today. Losses are down. Nonperforming's down. Credit's improved. We're generating a lot more earnings, right? And we have more liquidity, and we have more capital to start with. So we don't go into this next CCAR process being pessimistic at all. We got a great story to tell. We got a great relationship. We're going to make a proposal, and we're looking forward to working with the Fed.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "That's actually very helpful. I appreciate that. And if I could, John, just a follow-up or a question just in terms of the update on the AG settlement with California, in particular opting out, opting in, just your latest thoughts in terms of the settlement process, how that may evolve as you currently see it.", "John G. Stumpf", "There's nothing there to report.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Positive, negative?", "John G. Stumpf", "There's just if -- no, there's nothing new to report.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Listen, just a follow-up on Brian's questions a little bit on the mortgage banking side. The big announcement this quarter, well, we all know it's Bank of America getting out of the correspondent business. And it sure looks like some of these bigger guys are pulling back capacity, especially in the wholesale and correspondent business. Does that give an opportunity for Wells Fargo to expand capacity in that business?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, I think that it's fair to say that we've had a lot of opportunity to grow capacity today across the board not just because of the correspondent business alone, but I think the key is to make sure you do it in a real measured way because there are lots of correspondents that we'd like to do more business with and some we wouldn't. But that's not the primary driver for why our refis are up. Our refis are up because we already have a great servicing customer base.", "John G. Stumpf", "In fact, Paul, that's one of the things that, I think, is missed a lot. We have like a 25% or 26% share of overall originations. But it's much higher on the refinance because of the fact that our people do such a great job in servicing, we get a disproportionate higher number of people refinancing with us because of our servicing.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And the other issue is, and I hear it a lot from my contacts in the industry, is that -- and you've seen some of the notes I've written where the government is being tougher and tougher accepting mortgages now. Does that give an opportunity for you to start to find some niches on your balance sheet and put some decent loans on your balance sheet that's not necessarily jumbos but just doesn't fit the -- there could be Fannie and Freddie and FHA boxes?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, we wouldn't put loans on our balance sheet just because the government didn't like them. We put loans on our balance sheet if they provided a good risk/return. But there's no question in this environment that there's some good risk/return relative to other ways that we can deploy our liquidity, and mortgage is one of them.", "John G. Stumpf", "That's an opportunity, Paul, clearly.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And one last question. On the jumbo market, you saw that the FHA -- I mean, they're lowering the jumbo spreads a little bit. Are you seeing a pickup in signing of that jumbo product, or is that just really difficult?", "John G. Stumpf", "It's pretty early yet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I had a question -- actually, 2 questions. One is the deployment of liquidity into loans and securities. So you put about $39 billion into securities and about almost $10 billion into loans. What types of assets are you looking, and what kind of yield characteristics and duration are you trying to peg as you're going through that process?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, on the security side, Marty, it's really across the board. We really look at the risk-adjusted return based upon what's out there today, right? And so a portion went into short-term -- shorter-term, very high-quality investments, and then a portion went into medium-term and some longer-term durations. Obviously, there's more assets out there to buy than there were a few months ago. On the loan side, again, it's across the board. We feel really pleased that we're seeing loan growth in a number of our businesses, and not just 1 or 2. And then as John mentioned, and we gave a couple of examples, we're also able to buy loans in the market today, so it's not one specific area. It's across the board, and I think that just reinforces the value of the diversified model.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then when you're looking at revenue compression from last quarter, this quarter, you really have -- it looks like almost 3 components. The market sensitive is really going down over $800 million. You can kind of take some of those pluses and minuses, and it looks like that probably netted out to about a $0.02 impact negative from second to third quarter. And then you got mortgage offsetting the decline in what you would see in net interest income. The market-sensitive revenues, how do you look at that? And do you think that some of the uncertainty that we hit in this quarter, you'll begin to see some improvement, or did you see any improvement in that line as we moved through the quarter into the fourth quarter?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, Marty, I think you're right. And as we pointed out, there's some puts and takes in the market-sensitive revenue, so the $808 million is not what I would think about as a run rate basis, particularly compared to the second quarter because you also had an outsized gain in the second quarter that we called out then that we didn't have in the third quarter. I don't know what is going to happen in the capital markets in the next few months. They feel like they've settled down today, but you know what, you could have made that same statement in July, and you could have made that same statement in the middle of August. I think the important thing, as it relates to the capital markets, is make sure that you're focused on serving your customers, make sure that you've got good risk discipline in place, so you're not sitting on a bunch of loans that you have to sell or other securities that you have to mark in a significant way. And again, we think that we're pretty good at that. We've got a good team in place. We're being thoughtful about being focused on customers, so we're not overly concerned about our capital markets activity at all.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And lastly, would you say that your guidance on expenses saying that it's going to go up in the fourth quarter is primarily tied to the improvement that you see in your mortgage banking fee income?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, there's no question that we're going to have increases in expenses related to bringing on team members to support, underwrite and close the mortgage pipeline that we're seeing. That will be part of it. But also, we're still in the midst of an integration. As John mentioned, we had a milestone this weekend. And so the timing of those expenses happen when they happen. And our guess is there's going to be more of them in the fourth quarter than there were in the third quarter. And then also, there's generally some seasonality in all of our expense line items, so we'll probably get a little bit of a pickup there as we saw in the fourth quarter last year. But again, we want to be really clear that we've made a lot of progress in terms of reducing our expenses this quarter. We continue to believe that we're going to make a lot of progress and reiterate our goal of getting to an $11 billion run rate by the fourth quarter next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I'm looking at your business optimization expenses, down $363 million linked quarter. So what is that since that fueled a lot of the expense improvement?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, so that would've included a number of different items. None of them were candidly very significant, Mike. I mean, it's a bit here, a bit there, and it all totaled up to be the differential that's in the numbers.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "But those are permanent savings?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, there's always some timing in your expenses, but I would -- I guess the important thing is that we wanted to call out the fact that we didn't believe that, that $758 million reduction in expenses that we saw from the second quarter to the third quarter was all permanent, right? We called out the $234 million of deferred comp differential, and we've mentioned that integration costs were a little bit low, so I think the permanent reduction is less than that. And again, we think fourth quarter is going to be a little bit higher, but we'll get to the $11 billion number.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And I guess we're kind of dancing around the question. So do you think revenues will outpace expenses? Linked quarter, it looks like it was a tie, revenues and expenses both down $800 million. So as we look out, which will win, revenues or expenses?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I think over the long term, revenues are going to beat expenses, Mike.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And by the end of next year, which is the end of your Compass initiatives?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Revenues are going to beat expenses.", "John G. Stumpf", "In fact, Mike, that's the only way to run a successful company. And they're short term. We can't tell from quarter to quarter, and we wouldn't try to predict that. But when you do the right thing over a long period of time, invest in your people, your distribution, your customers, serve them well, serve them broadly and deeply, revenue wins in that race.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And so, yes, the key milestone then for us looking at the company would be the end of next year, we should see revenues surpass expenses if you achieve your target, if I heard that correctly?", "John G. Stumpf", "Correct.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then completely separate, you mentioned the foreclosure rate. You're doing everything you can to keep homeowners in their houses, but there are some houses that are owned as second properties or speculators or are empty. So my question is, what percent of homes that you foreclose on are not the primary residence of an individual that's living in the home?", "John G. Stumpf", "I don't know that number, but I can tell you that when we get to our foreclosure, customers, on average, are about 16 months past due and of the primary residence, about 25% have already abandoned the property. But I don't have the second home off the top of my head.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I have a question on Page 27 of the handout, where -- it's the page where you go through the PCI accretable yield.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And you outlined the expected cash flows. It went up this quarter by about $2.5 billion, which drove the total accretable yield number up from $14.9 billion to $16.9 billion.", "John G. Stumpf", "Right.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And then on a bullet down there, you say most of that came from the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. So I guess I'm just looking for some insight on what drove your expected cash flow on the Pick-a-Pay portfolio up that much during the quarter and then if any meaningful amount of the total accretable yield difference came from somewhere other than the Pick-a-Pay portfolio.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, it's a fair question. I think as you know, we look at this estimate every quarter. And there are lots of different factors that drive their assumptions. There's interest rate assumptions. There's liquidation timing, modification assumptions and their performance. And the performance in the Pick-a-Pay portfolio continues to be very strong. So it wasn't any one of those in particular. It was the combination of all of them. But again, we've had really good experience to date in terms of the performance of that Pick-a-Pay portfolio, but that was the primary driver for the $2.5 billion increase.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Do you expect that number to keep going higher? And could you remind us when we look at that $16.9 billion balance sort of how you think about the weighted average or what is the weighted average duration of that $16.9 billion?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, on Page 28 and Page 29, we show the weighted average life on commercial as well as Pick-a-Pay. And I would say that the average is approximately 11 years or 10 to 11 years because the lion's share of that yield is on the Pick-a-Pay side, so it's going to be around for a long period of time.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And no outlook in terms of where that 16.9 number.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "In terms of the number, no. I wouldn't -- I'd be guessing if there was a more specific outlook. I mean, look at -- as I said, we look at the assumptions and the flows kind of each quarter and come up with what we think, say, a reasonable estimate, and that's what we have here.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Thanks, Tim. And then as a quick follow-up, just looking at your average balance sheet and your mortgage-backed securities yield, that was one of the asset yields that came down a lot during the quarter, down, I think, by 62 basis points linked quarter. And I think I understand that some of that decline was because of an increase in the size of the MBS portfolio and the investment of some of the deposit inflows. But obviously, probably a good chunk of it was from refinancing activity as well. So I guess any insight as to how much more pressure you expect on that yield over the next quarter or 2 from refinancing pressure?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I would -- there's no question that we had some impact on refinancing, but I wouldn't say that's a big driver. And we don't expect that to be a big driver going forward or at least more than what we saw this quarter. The other reason that the yield went down is just in terms of some of the securities that we invested in this quarter.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "But generally, we should -- well, I mean, it seems likely that, that number will continue to come down. But any sense of how we should think about that from a pace standpoint in terms of that MBS average yield coming down?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, I really don't have one for you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.", "Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Bank of America recently announced the $5 fee, and by my calculations, that would recoup most of the loss from Durbin. And if that's the industry standard or if that's one of the -- what some of the major competitors out there, I guess why are you still more guarded and guiding that you can only recover half? And any idea how long it would take to recover what was lost on the Durbin side?", "John G. Stumpf", "Chris, the way we think about that is our focus is on building lifelong relationships with our consumers. And we have, as you know, grown checking and savings accounts dollars by $185 billion in 3 years. And they're responding to the value, the convenience and the choice that we're giving our consumers, and there's real value here. I mean, we have the most stores of any bank. We have 12,000 ATMs. We give free online and free bill pay and all these sort of things. So when you talk about how we're going to get paid for that, we're testing things, and we're going to learn. Our customers will help us understand how they want to pay for that value, that choice and that convenience. And we'll learn from those tests, and then we'll do what we think will be appropriate so we continue to grow households.", "Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then the second question I have, it's more of a numbers question, and I'm referring to Page 37 of the press release. And it's just that on a Basel I basis, your risk-weighted assets grew by about $8 billion, but on a Basel III basis, they grew by about $60 billion. And I was wondering, is that a new interpretation of the rules or there are different assets that you put on the balance sheet...", "Timothy J. Sloan", "It's an interpretation of the rules, right? And in fairness the rules aren't finalized yet. But we're making our best guess as to what they are, but that's the primary differential.", "Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And can you flesh that out a little bit? I mean, is it beginning to stabilize in your models, and can you talk at all about what caused the difference there?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I don't know if we can say it's going to stabilize because it's going to be a function of how we're going to grow the company, right? I mean, the easiest way to stabilize would be to shrink, and we don't want to do that.", "Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Well, I meant under the rules, or what caused the delta here and...", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, one thing is the OCI effects. Are you talking about the difference between Basel I and Basel III? I mean, that's an influence, and we're refining. Is that your question?", "Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "No, I guess my question was under Basel I, your risk-weighted assets went up by $8 billion. And under Basel III, I'm looking at the prior press release and this press release side-by-side, and your Basel III risk-weighted assets went from $1.1213 billion to $1.272 billion, and it just seemed like a big increase.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, again, we had growth in the balance sheet this quarter, right? And then we've got -- as we continue to refine our interpretation of Basel III, we're going to make adjustments. But again, there wasn't anything significant, and we don't really break that out on an asset class-by-asset class basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions. There is sort of a shorthand in the market right now with regard to bank stocks that the larger your securities portfolio, the more you're going to get hurt in the present rate environment. You guys have always been very astute securities portfolio managers. Could you just sort of address that?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I appreciate the compliment. First, thank you. What we want to do, Nancy, is look at where we see good risk/return. As we've said for the last year, as soon as rates started to really drop, it would be really easy for us to grow revenue and to grow the net interest margin by just investing in long-dated securities. And then we'd be more at risk for a backup when it comes, and someday, it will come. I think from our perspective, we want to look at good risk/return in terms of what's out there today. There's a lot out there today in terms of securities that we can buy. But we also want to make sure that we're pretty balanced in terms of short-, medium- and long-duration assets. We think we're fairly well positioned today because we have an unrecognized gain on the balance sheet that's still pretty significant. I think it's still over $6 billion. So we think we're in pretty good shape even if we saw a rate backup. But again, in a rate backup, even if it might affect the unrecognized or unrealized gain, it would be very beneficial for the rest of the company. And again, I think that is a testament to the balance model that we have.", "John G. Stumpf", "Nancy, I must look at -- I agree to everything Tim said, and one of the things that is happening today, we're not getting recognized or paid for the wonderful deposit franchise we have. And there is real value there. Rates won't stay this low forever. They will back up, and you're going to see the real quality of the liability side. And in the interim, things look different in the market today than they looked 9 months ago. Some good and some of it's not good as far as we got QE IIs and twists and this and that, and those things could have -- it surely will have an influence on rates. But over time, rates will rise, and I think we are uniquely well positioned for that time.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. The second question is this. I think the CFPB announced last week that one of their first forays would be an examination of the mortgage servicers to basically make sure you're not doing bad things. And it just seems to me that it's getting a little crowded in the mortgage servicing space right now. Could you guys just sort of summarize for us these various regulatory issues or activities that are sort of swirling around your mortgage servicing portfolio right now? And do you have any idea of how much this is costing you?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, you're correct, Nancy, that there's a lot of regulatory oversight in the mortgage servicing business today, whether you're talking about the CFPB upcoming activities or any of the other regulators. And we feel like we're implementing -- we began to implement changes last year. We've continued to implement more changes pursuant to the consent order, though the cost of those changes are included in all of our numbers right now.", "John G. Stumpf", "Nancy, think of it this way. A lot has changed in the mortgage business. It's really starting in 2008. There is no -- this low-doc and liar loans and stated income is all history. So if you look at the originations starting in -- it's really 2006 and 2008 vintages that we're working through. But 2008 from then on, it's really a different ballgame, first of all. Secondly, on the foreclosure side, as Tim mentioned, we have made changes. You're right. There are a lot of people and regulators and so forth that are swirling around. But in our case, most of our production is done by our people on the direct side, and we've been around this thing for a long time. And I'm confident that we've got the right people leading that organization. And you never know where all these things turn out, but it's a very different environment today vis-\u00e0-vis 5 or 6 years ago. Even we didn't participate in some of the most egregious things, we held our discipline really well during that time, not perfect but pretty darn well. I can't predict what's going to happen next, but it's a very different business.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "And just one final issue for you, John. I'm sure you're very well aware every day of Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Montgomery Street and all the other occupies that seem to be going on. You did a good summary at the beginning of the call, the stuff that Wells Fargo does, I think, that perhaps is not recognized: the charitable contributions, the level of employment, et cetera, et cetera. What do you and/or your banking industry peers need to do to make it known that the banking industry is not some big evil behemoth to out to crush the middle class?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, that is a good question. First of all, I understand some of the angst and the anger. This downturn has been too long. Unemployment is too high, and people are hurting. We get that. We have 265,000 people, which most of them are in the U.S. We live and work in these communities. We're committed to lead more, hire more, lend more, be part of the solution. And I don't think you do that through an advertising program. You do that knee to knee, street corner by street corner, community by community, and that's what we're committed to do.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "So no, you don't see anything coming out of the industry that's sort of an answer to some of the stuff that's being put out there by the administration and others at this point?", "John G. Stumpf", "I think we're all in this thing together, and I think we're all trying to respond in the most appropriate way of serving our communities, serving each other, helping to get the economy going. And again, I think this is very much about getting it done as opposed to some program of some type.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Tim, I got 2 reconciliation questions. Forget about the margin for a second. If I just look at net interest income dollars, your average earning assets were $26 billion in the quarter. Your deposit growth was slightly accretive to net interest income, and the accretable yield contribution wasn't materially different than what it was in the second quarter, and yet your net interest income dollars were down about $140 million sequentially. What drove the dollars being down?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, it was a function of one-timers that we had in the second quarter. It was a function of some security and loan runoff, and it was a function of repricing, but it was kind of all those together in terms of the decline.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Now it seems like if 12 of the 17 basis points of margin compression was deposit-related, but the deposit was actually accretive to net interest income dollars, it seems like the difference, the 5 basis points of compression would be more than offset by almost, what, $30 billion of average earning asset growth in the quarter. I'm just kind of -- I didn't see how the dollars came down as much as I had -- the dollars came down more than I would have anticipated given the growth in the balance sheet. The second thing on a reconciliation, when I look at the one line item on the income statement, the net gains from trading activities, now I know you went through some of those numbers, but that was a loss of $442 million. And if I back out, I think the 3 items you mentioned, the $234 million from deferred compensation investment income, the $106 million and the net loss between the 2 legacy Wachovia positions and $108 million in the weak markets, if I net those out, that line would have been 0. In the past 4, 5 quarters, it's been running about $500 million or so. So what's the difference netting -- even netting out those 3 items, what's the difference in that category this quarter versus what we've seen in the past 3 or 4 quarters?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Are you talking about the debt or equity or just the debt that...", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "This is net gains and losses from trading activities, which was negative $442 million a quarter. In the last 4 quarters, it's been roughly about $500 million positive.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, so within that number would've been the outsized equity gains that we had in the second quarter. And that's the primary driver in terms of the differential because remember, the equity gains that we had in the second quarter of about $725 million and this quarter...", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "No, that's in a different line item. On your income statement, your net gains on investment...", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I thought you were talking about the trading asset, not decline.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Well, this is just Page 19 of your release this morning. There's 2 different line items. There's net gains on trading activities. There's also net gain on equity investments. I think the net gain on the equity investments includes that onetime gain last quarter, but if you're looking at net gains on trading activities and I back out those onetime items, if you will, that would've been 0 versus, again, about a $500 million run rate the past 4 quarters. I don't think that includes the equity investment gains.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I thought you were talking about a different line item. I'm sorry. So if you look at the -- you're talking about the 854, right? That differential from the 415 to 441?", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Right, so you would have had the gross effect of one of the legacy Wachovia positions that we're, of course, reaching a resolution on. So that was about 370, 380, and you would have had the 234 in terms of the deferred comp. And the rest of it was just a function of what was going on in the market and nothing specific.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So there's no one line item in there that wasn't more negative than the 3 items that you mentioned in your statements?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, we would have called it out if that was the case.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you very much. We appreciate everybody's time, and we will do this next quarter. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today, during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will review fourth quarter results and answer your questions. ", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. ", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website at wellsfargo.com. ", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Happy new year, and thanks for joining us today. A year ago, we were excited about all the opportunities we had ahead of us, even in a challenging economic environment, and I couldn't be more pleased with all that we accomplished in 2011. We earned a record $15.9 billion, up 28% from 2010. We grew deposits by $72 billion, up 9%. We grew loans by $12 billion and grew our core loan portfolio by $33 billion. We achieved record retail banking cross-sell of 5.9 products per household. We improved credit quality with net charge-offs down 36% from a year ago. We began our expense initiative and remained focus on our target of $11 billion in noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of this year, 2012. We grew ROA by 24 basis points and increased ROE by 160 basis points. And we remain committed to helping homeowners stay in their homes, with over 720,000 active or completed loan modifications initiated since the beginning of 2009. ", "We also increased capital levels while providing shareholders with a higher return on their investment by increasing our dividend and repurchasing 86 million shares of common stock. We also redeemed $9.2 billion of high-cost trust preferred securities. We accomplished all of this while completing the conversion of Wachovia's retail banking stores, the largest conversion in banking history. Our 6,239 retail banking stores are now on a single platform, serving customers coast to coast. In most mergers in financial services, customer service typically declines, but our team members remain committed to providing outstanding customer service as reflected in Wells Fargo, once again, ranking #1 in customer satisfaction among large banks based on a national survey. ", "2011 was a remarkable year, but I'm even more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as we enter 2012 as One Wells Fargo. We have submitted our board-approved capital plan to the Fed, and we are focused on returning even more capital to our shareholders. We remain focused on better serving our existing customers and welcoming new customers as we grow market share, both organically and through acquisitions. And we remain committed to strengthening the overall economy by lending to our business customers to fund growth and create jobs, by helping homeowners stay in their homes through participating in Home Preservation Workshops and loan modifications and by being active volunteers in the communities where we live and where we work. The vision -- this vision has guided us for decades, meeting our customers' financial needs, will continue to drive our growth in the year ahead. ", "Let me now turn this over to Tim Sloan for more detail on our financial results. Tim?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the presentation included in the first half of the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then take your questions. ", "As John highlighted, we achieved outstanding results in 2011, including a very strong fourth quarter. We generated record earnings of $4.1 billion, up 1% from the third quarter and up 20% from a year ago. Earnings per share were a record $0.73, also up 1% from last quarter and 20% from a year ago. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of EPS growth. In fact, by almost any measure, our results in the fourth quarter moved in the right direction, demonstrating the underlying strength of our diversified franchise. We had linked quarter growth in revenue with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. We had higher pretax pre-provision profits, loans, deposits and securities available for sale. We also had strong credit quality, and our capital levels continue to grow. ", "On Page 3, we highlight our continued strong diversification, which is a major differentiator for Wells Fargo and is a key driver of our ability to generate growth over time and through various economic cycles and interest rate environments. Let me start with a few highlights of the drivers behind our balance sheet and income statement growth, and I'll add more detail later in my remarks. ", "Starting with the balance sheet. We generated strong loan growth this quarter with loans up $9.5 billion. Our core loan portfolio, which excludes the planned runoff from the liquidating portfolio, was up $13.7 billion from the third quarter. We, once again, purchased securities this quarter with balances up $15.4 billion from the third quarter as we continue to redeploy cash. We also generated strong deposit growth with balances up $24.6 billion. ", "Now let's turn to the income statement. Revenue grew by 5% from the third quarter, driven by strong loan growth and deposit growth, as well as fee growth throughout our diversified businesses. Expenses increased as expected in the fourth quarter, but we are still targeting $11 billion in noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2012. ", "Let me now cover our results in more detail. As shown on Page 6, period-end loans were up $9.5 billion from the third quarter, our third consecutive quarter of loan growth, while we continue to reduce the size of our liquidating portfolio. Excluding the runoff of $4.2 billion of liquidating loans, our core loans grew by $13.7 billion, including organic loan growth of $6 billion. ", "Commercial loans grew $5.6 billion, driven by portfolio acquisitions, new loans and new customer activity. Loan growth in the fourth quarter included the purchase of $2.1 billion of U.S.-based commercial real estate loans. We have purchased several portfolios over the past few quarters, which reflect our ability to capitalize in the opportunities generated in this business environment and provide attractive returns for our shareholders. While we have -- while we already have relationships with many of these customers, these portfolio purchases also provide us with new customers that we hope to do more business with in the future. ", "Consumer loans also grew this quarter, up $3.9 billion from the third quarter, driven by the reconsolidation of $5.6 billion of reverse mortgage loans and was reduced by the runoff of $3.6 billion of liquidating consumer loans. We had loan growth in our core auto portfolio. Our credit card portfolio growth reflected strong account growth and seasonality. We believe we're well positioned to grow loans organically and through acquisitions, and we expect loan growth to continue. ", "We also continue to generate strong deposit growth, with average deposits up $29.5 billion from the third quarter and up $74 billion or 9% from a year ago. Average core checking and savings deposits grew $30.9 billion or 4% from the third quarter and were up 12% from a year ago. Consumer checking accounts were up 3.2% from a year ago. We achieved this growth while continuing to bring down our deposit cost, which were 22 basis points in the fourth quarter, down 3 basis points from the third quarter and down 9 basis points from a year ago. We have grown deposits while reducing our deposit cost for 5 consecutive quarters. ", "Tax equivalent net interest income increased $369 million from the third quarter, benefiting from a $24 billion increase in average earning assets and a 5 basis point increase in net interest margin. Earning asset growth this quarter was broad based, with increases in loans, securities and mortgages held for sale. We funded the growth in these assets by continuing to successfully attract low-cost deposits and by reducing cash and other short-term investments. ", "The balance sheet continue to reprice in this low-rate environment but we were able to offset that through pricing discipline, including a 4 -basis point decline in interest-bearing deposit cost and reducing long-term debt by $10 billion in the fourth quarter.  ", "Noninterest income increased $627 million from the third quarter or 7%. This growth was driven by an increase in mortgage banking revenue of $531 million, up 29% from the third quarter, driven by higher margins and strong originations. Originations increased $31 billion or 35% from the third quarter. The unclosed mortgage pipeline remained very strong at $72 billion at quarter end. Trading, debt and equity gains were up $337 million from the third quarter. Linked quarter growth in trading gains benefited from $275 million of higher deferred compensation plan investment results, which is offset in expense, and stronger core customer accommodation trading. The linked quarter comparison also benefits because you recall that the third quarter included a loss from resolving one legacy Wachovia position. Noninterest income also benefited from $153 million gain on the sale of H.D. Vest in the fourth quarter. ", "Credit card fees were down $333 million from the third quarter, reflecting the first quarter of lower debit interchange fees, which reduced debit card fees by $365 million in the fourth quarter. Card fees benefited this quarter from strong growth in consumer credit cards, with new account growth up 6% from the third quarter and up 90% from the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by very strong growth in the east. ", "Noninterest expense increased 7% from the third quarter. We highlighted on the call last quarter that we expected expenses to increase in the fourth quarter. Let me walk you through the drivers of the increase on Slide 11. ", "Third quarter expenses included a $210 million benefit due to lower deferred compensation expenses, and the fourth quarter had a net deferred compensation expense of $56 million. These 2 amounts increased fourth quarter expenses by $266 million compared to the third quarter. After adjusting for this amount, the remaining increase in expenses were driven by 3 primary factors. First, mortgage and capital markets personnel expense increased approximately $300 million, driven by higher revenue in the third -- in the quarter, which is largely reflected in higher incentive compensation. Secondly, we have seasonally higher equipment cost and higher foreclosed asset expense. Combined, these increased expenses by approximately $200 million. Finally, we had approximately $100 million of higher cost associated with the mortgage servicing regulatory consent order. ", "We currently expect first quarter expenses to remain elevated, driven by seasonally higher comp and benefit expenses and, our final quarter, Wachovia integration expenses, but partially offset by continued gains from our expense initiatives. In the second quarter of 2012, we expect expenses will decline by $500 million to $700 million from the first quarter, driven by the elimination of merger expenses and lower comp and benefit expenses, which as I just mentioned, will be seasonally higher in the first quarter. ", "Our expenses in 2012 will reflect the benefit from our expense initiative, and we continue to target noninterest expenses declining to $11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect to capture most of the savings through the consolidation of consumer lending businesses, combining staff functions and technology groups, moderation of cyclically high mortgage costs, including loss remediation and simplifying customer interaction to improve service and efficiencies. ", "Turning briefly to our segment results starting on Page 13. Community Banking earned $2.5 billion, up 8% from the third quarter, driven by stronger mortgage banking revenue. Sales trends remain strong. Core product sales in the West were $7.6 million, up 9% from the prior year, and core product sales in the East continue to grow by double digits. Retail Banking cross-sell continue to grow to a record 5.92 products per household, up from 5.7 a year ago. And while cross-sell in the East continue to grow to 5.43, there is still plenty of opportunity to further increase cross-sell to the 6.29 products per household in the West. ", "Wholesale Banking earned $1.6 billion, down $172 million from the third quarter, reflecting lower loan loss reserve release. Revenue increased 5% from the third quarter as many businesses, including commercial real estate, banking, government banking and international, generated strong loan and deposit growth, and fixed income sales and trading and investment banking results benefited from improved market conditions. Wholesale Banking continued to generate strong broad-based loan growth from both new and existing customers, with average loans up $11.4 billion or 4% from the third quarter. This growth reflects the purchase of $2.1 billion of U.S.-based commercial real estate loans, as well as growth across from all portfolios, including: commercial banking, which has grown loan for 17 consecutive months; international; commercial real estate; capital finance; asset-backed finance; government banking; and corporate banking. Average core deposits increased $14 billion from the third quarter, up 7% and are up $38 billion or 21% from a year ago. Wholesale Banking businesses continue to increase market share, including our investment banking market share growing from 4.2% in 2010 to 5.1% in 2011. ", "Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $325 million, up 12% from the third quarter. This growth was driven by a 6% increase in revenue. Revenue benefited from the $153 million gain on the sale of H.D. Vest and $59 million of deferred compensation plan investment gains compared to $128 million loss in the third quarter. Excluding these items, revenue was down 5% on lower asset-based fees, retail brokerage transaction revenue and securities gains. Average core deposits increased $3.2 billion, up 2% from the third quarter, reflecting both the flight to quality and our continued success in attracting client assets, including deposits. Managed account assets were up 7% from the third quarter, driven by strong net inflows. Since managed account asset fees are priced on a quarterly lag, first quarter revenue will benefit from the improved fourth quarter markets. Our continued focus on meeting our customers' financial needs is reflected in achieving a record cross-sell of over 10 products per WBR household. ", "Our credit quality remains strong in the quarter as shown on Page 16. Net charge-offs were stable from the third quarter and down 51% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2009. We remain pleased with how our loan portfolios are performing, and we expect them to continue to improve in 2012. Reflecting our continued improvement in credit quality, we had a $600 million reserve release in the fourth quarter. Absent a significant deterioration in the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases in 2012. ", "Nonperforming assets continue to decline, down $879 million from the third quarter, reflecting a $596 million decline in nonaccrual loans driven by a lower commercial real estate non-accruals and a $283 million decrease in foreclosed assets. Loans 90 days or more past due were up modestly, $119 million, while early stage retail delinquency balances were stable, with rates up modestly on lower loan balances. ", "On Page 18, we highlight what we believe our mortgage servicing portfolio is the best in the industry. The majority of our $1.8 trillion residential servicing portfolio, or 69%, is serviced through the agencies. Our private securitizations where we originated the loans are very -- are a very low portion of our total portfolio. ", "Reflecting the quality of our portfolio, our delinquency and foreclosure rate was over 400 basis points lower than the industry average, excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recent publicly available data. Our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 7.96% in the fourth quarter, down from a peak of 8.96% in the fourth quarter of 2009 but up modestly from the third quarter due to seasonality. Total repurchase demands were stable compared to the third quarter and went down approximately 31% from a year ago. ", "As shown on Page 20, our capital position continue to improve, with our Tier 1 common equity ratio increasing to 9.46% and our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under current Basel III proposals growing to 7.49%. We redeemed $5.8 billion of trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter, with a weighted average coupon of 8.42%. We purchased 26.6 million shares in the fourth quarter and an additional estimated 5.6 million shares through a full repurchase transaction that will settle in the first quarter of 2012. As John mentioned at the beginning of the call, we submitted our capital plan earlier this month, and we expect to response no later than March 15. We have a great story to tell, reflecting the performance of our diversified model and the strength of our balance sheet. We remain focused on returning more capital to our shareholders as we continue to grow our capital levels. ", "In summary, our strong fourth quarter and full year 2011 results reflected the benefit of our diversified model, which provides us with many opportunities for growth. In the fourth quarter, we grew earnings, revenue, loans, deposits and capital with strong contributions throughout our consumer and commercial businesses. As we begin the new year, we're encouraged by the signs the U.S. economy is doing better, and we believe Wells Fargo is in a unique position to further benefit from the opportunities that drove a record performance in 2011. ", "I will now open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "If I could just focus on the net interest margin percent and net interest income dollars to start. Last quarter, the market was disappointed in the NIM percent, specifically. You guys probably had one of the worst NIMs last quarter. It seems like this quarter, you'll probably have one of the best ones. And I appreciate there's a lot of moving pieces. But as you look forward, maybe you can give some insight on how you think the NIM percent and the net interest income dollars will trend from here and if we can expect similar volatility to what we've seen.", "John G. Stumpf", "Matt, you focused on the fact that it's difficult to look at the NIM on a quarterly basis and there can be some volatility quarter-to-quarter, so I don't want to provide any specific guidance on the NIM. But as we've said, generally, we think that the NIM is trending down a bit given that the -- that rates are lower. However, as you pointed out, our net interest income was up, and the reason that net interest income was up was because we were able to grow loans and continue to invest in high-quality securities.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And I guess as a follow-up on that, as I think about the loans that are running off and the loans that you're purchasing, they're starting to converge a little bit in terms of magnitude, meaning just the runoff is less of a drag from -- or so far. Now going forward, there have obviously been some portfolios in the news since speculation of you bidding on some, but what do you think the opportunity is for additional loan purchases from here? And maybe some comment on how those yields compared to what's running off.", "John G. Stumpf", "Matt, we are taking lots of tires. We are in a unique position that we're not capital constrained. We can do things that make good sense for us economically for our stockholders. As you know, and you know, Wells Fargo well, we are cautious. It have to make a lot of sense for us. And if all we get out of this is sore toes, that's fine also, but there -- because we don't have to do something. But the deals we've done so far, we like a lot. It brings customers. It brings earning assets. And of course, we're not going to do these things unless they're good economically for us. So that's just one of the opportunities we have going forward, and I suspect we'll see more things. And again, if we do some, they'll be done at the right way. If we don't do any, that's also fine.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And how did the yields compare? You show us the runoff portfolio yields, but how about the loans that you're purchasing and might be looking at. How do those yields compared to what's running off?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, there -- these are attractive IRRs. We wouldn't do them unless that'd be the case.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "One follow-up on Matt's question on liquidity. Tim, maybe just a little bit of color of what led you to deploy liquidity this quarter and into what did you deploy that. And do you still feel like you're sitting on excess liquidity? And what will drive the pace at which you further deploy the liquidity you have?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Sure. As you know, the first call on our liquidity at any time is going to be for loans. And we had good loan growth this quarter both organically and through acquisitions, which we're excited about. When you look at our investments in the securities portfolio, there really weren't a whole lot different than what we looked at in the third quarter. The timing was a little bit different, because you recall, in the third quarter, there was a lot of volatility that occurred in a good portion of the third quarter. So we invested, more or less, ratably across the quarter, which is a good thing. We really didn't change the complexion of the securities portfolio. We continue to invest in high-quality assets across duration -- the duration of the portfolio didn't significant change. As to your last question about capacity, one of the great things about the company is that we're continuing to grow deposits. And we feel like we've got -- have more than ample liquidity to continue to grow and service our existing customers, maybe look at some acquisitions, as John mentioned, and continue to invest in the securities portfolio.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then on expenses. Can you talk a little bit more color about the drivers of the decline that you expect in the second quarter? Specifically, first, the merger integration expenses will stop in the second quarter, will those stop for good? And then also in the personnel decline that you're talking about in the second quarter, is that seasonal, the mortgage banking, or is this some of the consolidation of functions that you're doing? Can you give a little more color there?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Sure. So if you go back to Slide 11, I think that the first -- I'm sorry, Slide 12. The first part of the question relates to the integration, and the integration expenses will be over in the first quarter. So we won't be talking about them again after first quarter. So that's number one. Number two, the incentive compensation and expenses and employee comp in the first quarter is more seasonal. It's not necessarily cyclical. It's not necessarily tied to any business. It's just in the first quarter, you tend to have more incentive comp and in terms of when you recognize it, as well as the fact that you might recognize payroll taxes at a higher rate in the first quarter.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And if you're going to walk us down from second quarter down to the fourth quarter, where you hope to get to $11 billion, the drivers of that would be the other things on this table on Page 12?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Correct. And again, to reiterate, we feel good about being able to see the expenses decline from the first to the second quarter by $500 million to $700 million, which takes us a long way to get to that $11 billion.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And the last thing for me is on share repurchases. The forward contract that you entered for the first quarter of $5.6 million, is that the entirety of what you're approved for this quarter? Or you have approval to do additional open market purchases in the first quarter beyond that?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. Matt, I'm not going to comment on any specifics of the capital plan from last year, as well as what we submitted for this year.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, okay. You just said that you hope to do more in 2012. I guess you said that already, Tim.", "John G. Stumpf", "That's correct. Yes, more is more as I said before. And our shareholders have been very patient, and we'll have to just wait until the 15th of March.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Could you give us a sense of what you think on the -- in terms of mitigating some of the Durbin headwind, on what you could accomplish with regards to implementing deposit fees in 2012?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, Erika, we have talked a lot about the fact that, in most cases, our customers pay for all the convenience we offer them through more products and services with us, and that's always been the case around here. And in fact, if you look at the hit we took in the fourth quarter, now that the debit interchange number is all through that, it was actually a little less than the $2.50 after tax that we have talked about because we're doing more business. And we actually have more accounts now. So -- but we're always looking at ways to tighten our belt, offer more value, look at ways that customers how they want to pay us for the services we provide, and that's an ongoing process.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And I hear the message loud and clear, in terms of not answering any questions about what was submitted to the regulators with regard to your capital plan. But I have a timing question. I'm wondering if there are opportunities that are more sizable for M&A that could be coming out of Europe or even in the U.S. Does the fact that you're not going to get an answer from the Fed until March 15 deter you from doing anything between now and then?", "John G. Stumpf", "There was some background noise during the question, so people put their phones on mute. That would be great while they're not speaking. But anyway, we have -- as I mentioned, we continue to kick tires. We're looking at things, and we'll do that. We're doing that continuously. But again, we're cautious. We don't had to do anything. If we do something, it will be a bolt-on business or it'd be an add to something we're doing right now, either in terms of capability or capacity or new customers. And that'll continue even during this process.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "But just to follow-up and clarify. The fact that the capital plan is outstanding for approval doesn't impact your ability to make an announcement before March 15, in terms of any M&A.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, it doesn't.", "John G. Stumpf", "No, it does not.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Real quick on the -- it looks like you grew your residential loans by $6 billion, looking at the average balance sheet. If I'm incorrect, can you tell me what did you grow it by? And if you did, was that a change of policy? It's the first time we've seen some material growth in that residential portfolios.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, Paul, we did reconsolidate $5.6 billion of reverse mortgages that we have previously sold, based upon some clarifying guidance that SEC provided to the entire industry. So that was the primary driver for the growth in the residential loan line this quarter.", "John G. Stumpf", "The economics stay the same, Paul, but that -- it's more of an accounting.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "We earn a servicing fee that loans continue to be insured by the FHA, so it was more of accounting transaction than anything.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay, okay. And real quick on the HAMP program that was announced over the quarter, do you think that's going to be material? Are you guys at all, or do you think there's still too many roadblocks for that program to have any impact at all in the mortgage market? Not the HAMP part, the HARP.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes. You're talking about the HARP 2?", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Yes, HARP 2.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes, there's going to be some customers, and we're ramping up. We're going to be helping them, and it's hard to say today how many and so forth. But we're eager to help customers who have 7% and 8% coupons refinanced down to 4%, notwithstanding their loan-to-value issue, which has been the issue. But again, it's hard for me to predict how big that will be. Incidentally with HARP 1, we've been doing a lot of those. This is -- kind of takes it above the 1.25 or whatever the number is. So we'll catch up to you in there, but I don't -- this is not going to be a refinance boom equal to 2003, for example. I mean, a lot of -- there's been a lot of refinancing going on. But there are some customers there, and we're eager to help them.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. Paul, I think the administration set an expectation of about 1 million mortgages as part of this program, and that seems about right to us.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And then we've seen a lot of turmoil come out of Fannie and Freddie recently, a lot of a political fallout from their high salary. We just saw Williams just stepped down. Are you seeing -- I mean, is -- do you -- how -- do you think it is a negative for Fannie and Freddie going forward, or you don't think it's really -- it's business as usual out there?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, I don't know that I focus on that. I mean, we're focused on helping customers. And whatever happens with Fannie and Freddie, I mean, we're getting support and approvals that we need. Of course, you know there's been a small increase in the GPs. That probably affects things more than what's happening at Fannie and Freddie's management levels.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, just 2 quick questions. Tim, I appreciate no sort of forecast for the net interest margin, but do you mind going over some of the big pieces that you see in terms of your ongoing ability to reduce funding cost, like more TRUPs redemptions, long-term debt, lower deposit cost? Could you just sort of remind us how you sort of think about the opportunity remain?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, let's -- sure. Let's start in reverse order. I think, first, on lower deposit costs. I mean, the team has done a terrific job over the last couple years of reducing deposit costs. And given where rates are today, we think that there's still more room to reduce deposit cost. Specifically what that -- the number is, I don't know on a quarterly basis. But if you've seen the last couple of quarters, it's been pretty consistent. And so we're optimistic that we'll continue to make progress even as we grow deposits, which is pretty important. I think if we were reducing deposit across and not growing deposits, that would probably not be a good thing. In terms of the TRUPs, we had a -- or we called about 7 -- or we have about $7.5 billion that are still outstanding and $2.7 billion have a call date in 2012, right. Beyond that, I don't want to provide any specific guidance about the TRUPs. That's part of our capital plan submission, so we'll leave it at that. In terms of long-term debt, we think that we've done a nice job of reducing overall debt. I think, over time, in our overall debt over the last 3 years, I think it's down 53%, which is really good results. But I think, over time, you'll probably see us be a little bit more active in the market as opposed to continuing to decrease long-term debt. But I do think, given where rates and spreads are, that we can reduce our overall debt cost even if we do have to raise some debt in the future.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then is there a portion of noninterest-bearing deposits that we should think about maybe going away in 2012 because of escrow deposits related to the very strong mortgage origination quarter?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, escrow deposits were up, I think, slightly. Actually, I can't recall the specific number off the top of my head...", "John G. Stumpf", "Around $35 billion.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "But they were up a bit. And that's really reflective of what's going on in the mortgage market. Certainly, if the mortgage market continues to be a strong as it is right now, they'll be the same as the mortgage market comes down a bit. Escrows will be down. But those are the only deposits I will look at as being concerned about, non-interest-bearing deposits being concerned about moving away based upon what's going on in the economy.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, sort of mixed trends on the linked quarter credit quality improvement. We saw delinquencies tick up a bit. Could you put a little more color around your thoughts? You mentioned that you thought you expected more reserve release in 2012. I don't really expect you to quantify that but maybe that thought in conjunction with sort of the trends we saw in credit metrics this quarter.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. That's a fair question. Overall, we were very pleased with credit. We continue to have very strong credit. Where we are right now is consistent with the expectations that we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters and consistent with what we're seeing at this part of the credit cycle. NPAs were down almost $900 million on a link quarter basis. That was very nice progress. Charge-offs were stable. Retail delinquencies, 30-plus delinquencies, were normally up and in the fourth quarter due to seasonality and they were stable this quarter, so we're pleased about that. It's an item that we've all forgotten about but our PCI loans continue to perform better than what our expectations. Now almost $4 billion better than our original projections and that we still have 27.5% coverage in terms of the non-accretable on the PCI. So we continue to feel good on credit. Our expectation is that credit will continue to improve throughout this year. It's not going to improve at the same -- we don't think it will improve at the same rate as what we saw over the last couple of years but we'll continue to see improvement. And again, as you mentioned and I'll reiterate it, I think the fact of the matter is that our loan loss reserve release are likely to continue this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the last question. Just how should we -- Tim, with your outlook on credit and again, just you look at the kind of the stabilizing trends that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, if I think about the loan loss release and your expectations, how is the housing market kind of factored into the equation and the consumer in particular as you guys look out the next 12 to 18 months?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, the housing market clearly is factored into how we think about our loan loss reserve. And to the extent that the housing market gets better, that's a good thing; if it gets worse, it's a bad thing. But the primary driver in terms of consumer delinquencies and losses is jobs. That's the primary focus from our perspective in terms of the portfolio. But again, at this point in the cycle, where we've had a lot of improvement and the economy is growing but growing very slowly, it's not a surprise that we've seen a couple of quarters of reduced improvement. But remember, even in this quarter, our consumer losses were down, which we're pretty pleased with.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes, and think of it this way. Since 2008, underwriting in some of these portfolios have changed. So all of a sudden, you have 8 and 9 and 10 and 11, that becomes a more substantial part of your portfolio. And if you look at our delinquencies on residential real estate and you look at how well we're doing in commercial, I couldn't be happy with our progress on credit.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I guess, what I'm getting at is just in terms of the embedded reserve and granted your coverage ratios are very strong. But I guess what I'm driving at is kind of the embedded or assumptions in terms of home price decline, unemployment, that sort of thing in terms of, as you factor into your outlook on credit.", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, that's all factored in there. I mean, we look at that. We consider that. We obviously have a -- we stressed these portfolios and we look at indicators. And as Tim mentioned, on the consumer side, where you typically see a seasonal run-up in consumer delinquency, we didn't. So that bodes well for the future.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then if I could just real quickly switching gears, just on the mortgage side. The reps and warranties cost ticked up a little bit in the quarter. Can you just talk about kind of just, again, the trends that you're seeing? Is that something that should be, is it going to be fairly lumpy? Is it something specific more with Fannie versus Freddie in the quarter in terms of the earlier stage delinquency buckets, if you would? Just kind of trying to get a gauge on what your expectations, what happened in the quarter?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Actually, the fourth quarter results in terms of the mortgage repurchase reserve were pretty stable. Total demands outstanding both in terms of the number and the balance were stable in the fourth quarter and recall they're down over 30% from the prior year. The new demands that we saw for the '06 to '08 vintages are still up as John said, that was the vintages that are most problematic. But again for us, relative to the rest of the industry, it's less than an issue. But they were up for Fannie, that's been consistent now for about 3 quarters. Freddie was still within our expectations. But again, it's important to note that our realized losses were $272 million, which were down in the fourth quarter from $384 million in the third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "On the FHA insured loans that are 90 days more past due and still accruing, I recognize the risk really is on your balance sheet but can you just talk about the trends? They seem to be bouncing around between $14 billion and $15 billion up until the middle of this year, and then there's been a pretty significant ramp over the past 6 months. Is that timing or is that deterioration of FHA loans overall? And as a follow-up, is there any signs that there could be risk to the banking industry of the FHA potentially putting some of these losses to the banks?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, let me jump on the first part of your question and I'll let John answer the last. I think that what you're seeing is the fact that we're a very large mortgage lender in this country and that our volumes are up and our market share is up. So it's understandable that because our FHA/VA origination volume has increased since the end of 2008, that there's going to be a natural increase in delinquency. If you look at the performance of these mortgages relative to what we've seen in history, they're not performing any, they're actually performing better than what we've seen historically, it's just that we're a bigger lender. And as you point out, these continue to be guaranteed by FHA/VA. John, I don't know if you have any comments about FHA and VA.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes. We've not seen any change in how they handle their guarantees and their situations. So I have nothing to report on that.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Fair enough and a separate question. I guess ambitions in capital markets and retail brokerage and specifically, a lot of things are coming to market as other banks are forced to deleverage and as some of the wholesale business models come under pressure. How do you think about the trade-off between organic growth in those areas versus any pockets where acquisitions might make more sense?", "John G. Stumpf", "As I mentioned in either my formal comments or just made a few minutes ago, we're taking tiers. We're taking lots of tiers and our use of capital on the acquisition side will be for businesses that are bolt on to existing areas of expertise that we have and you've seen that recently, where we did a couple things with Irish assets here in the U.S. It will be places where we can either add skill or scale for customers. And it will, and think of things starting with customers. That's kind of who we are. So, and if we do, like I mentioned, if we do some things, it will be done right, the right price, it will be compelling for our stockholders. If we can't find those things, we won't do them. So it's really that simple.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Tim, I had a quick question, just follow up on the securities portfolio. I mean, I know you said that you bought throughout the quarter but there's still a pretty big difference between the end of period balances and the average balances for the available for sale. Should I suspect to see the average balances on the available for sale to catch up to the end of period balances in the first quarter? It's about a $20 billion difference between the 2 right now.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Chris, that may be the case. Again, it take some time. When you look at the quarterly numbers, you can get a little bit of distortion. But yes, I think that it's more likely that they'll catch up than not.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And similar to that, on the trading side, your trading assets on an end of period basis were roughly, what, $77 billion or so and even running in more in the mid-50s. Is that $77 billion a decent run rate going forward in 2012 or that line item?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, I don't think so. I think -- it's a good question though. The primary driver for the increase was that we had some conforming mortgage production, agency conforming mortgage production that we decided to hold over through the end of the year because we thought we could get a better execution in the first part of 2012. Because the production had already been securitized just by accounting definitions, it had to be classified as a trading asset. We've now -- and it was about $20 billion as you point out. About $19 billion of that $20 billion is already settled and we'll settle the remaining one sometime this week. So I would not look at that increase in the $77 billion as the run rate in the future.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So there's no economic gain in the first quarter with the $19 billion removal from trading assets?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "There was just a modest positive impact in the fourth quarter. There will be a gain in the first quarter but it's not significant to the company. We just thought we could get a better execution.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "First question on loan utilization and commercial and industrial loans. Has that picked up or is this really acquisitions and market share gains?", "John G. Stumpf", "It's acquisitions and market share gain. We've seen nothing really -- just very, very modest. It didn't account for much.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "So this commercial loan growth that we're seeing in the industry, why are we seeing it if there's not that natural demand?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, first of all, there's fewer players that are sharing it. And we have more people on the street and an offering that includes not only loans but other things that help customers succeed, so. And we're not capital constrained. At least we have that escape for us.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And you didn't mention Europe, to the extent that there's opportunities there?", "John G. Stumpf", "You mean to buy in Europe or to buy...", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Market share gains.", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, we're -- 98% of our revenues come from the United States, 98% of our people are here. We're really focused on -- there's so much growth and so much opportunity here. I mean, I wouldn't rule out -- I never say never in anything. But I can tell you, we are really focused on serving our domestic customers now that we have Wachovia integrated. And surely we help individuals and companies as they do business overseas and vice versa. But our focus is really, our primary focus I should put it that way, is domestic.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "So how does the European crisis impact you if at all? Is it a nonevent or you -- how could impact you?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, it impacts us as foreign banks, especially European banks, are trying to solve for their capital requirements. And they are, as you've seen, offering assets and businesses for sale. And we have -- we have been successful in some of those. And our direct exposure to the 5 most challenged countries, the sovereign exposure is next to nil and our overall exposure is also very small. So we don't have a lot of direct exposure to the troubled countries of Europe. But surely, if Europe's challenges worsen and I'm not going to expect that, but if they do worsen, that would have an impact on the overall U.S. economy or could have an impact and then we could get impacted but our exposure is quite indirect, if you will.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Then, last question, on your expense plan. When you talk about it, you talk about getting rid of your merger expenses and a lower comp and benefits and it doesn't sound so structural. It sounds kind of cyclical. Just the way you talk about it, I know you said there's some technology in consumer lending. Can you just explain in more general terms, why do you have these extra expense savings, I guess you're looking to go from, what, $12.5 billion down to $11 billion by the fourth quarter of this year. Is this all just a cycle or is there something more fundamental happening?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I think there's something more fundamental that's happening. The progress that we're making is being masked by some of the items that we've been very specific to call out. But as we mentioned on Slide 12, we've reorganized and consolidated our consumer lending businesses. There will be a lot of savings related to that. We're combining many of our staff functions and technology groups and we can do that now that we're almost done with the merger. We do believe that there's some cyclically high mortgage costs that are going to roll off. So it's a combination of a lot of different things but it is a result of a lot of hard work and effort on the part of the team.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Should we characterize this as a second look at expenses now that the merger integration is complete? Just as a second look at the old Wachovia First Union merger? Is there -- how would you describe it?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I would describe it as being more reflective of what's going on from an economic standpoint, from a regulatory standpoint. We made a lot of really thoughtful decisions about how we were going to be organized in a different environment in the first quarter of 2009. And we've made a lot of success. We've had a lot of success in integrating the platform. As you recall, about a year ago, we've stepped back and said, \"Well, how do we want the company to look going forward?\" And we're making some changes reflective of what's going on in the environment right now. I think it's really important that we continue to improve. This isn't just about reducing expenses this year and hoping for the best. It's about a focus on providing more value to our customers. That's the primary driver of our expense initiatives, how can we drive more value to our customers and be more efficient.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. One is on the efficiency ratio, taking your $11 billion, which is very clear and I like the way you're putting that out there. But the business will move up and down, hopefully, revenues as we saw this quarter, starting to see some improvement. So if you look at the efficiency ratio coming into the year, we were kind of in the mid-60s, sort of 63% to 64%. As we got through the third quarter, it improved to 60%. In the fourth quarter, it ticked up about 1%. If I take the $11 billion and just kind of put it on the income statement, it actually brings our efficiency ratio down below 55%. Is that kind of the goal we're looking at? I was just trying to equate it, so we can move from just the $11 billion into somewhat of an efficiency target as well.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. Marty, it's a fair question. But candidly, we have not set a specific efficiency goal. We set a run rate. So the efficiency is going to be whatever it's going to be based upon where our revenues are going to be in the fourth quarter. But clearly, we think that a 60% rate is too high.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And so the seasonality of the revenues this quarter, given the mortgage always has a strong fourth quarter hasn't really over -- I did say I want to make sure we weren't overemphasizing that number to get down to 53%, something like that would be doable given the assumptions we have.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. Marty, I don't know if 53% or 54% is doable. I think historically, if you look at the company, we've been down in that range. The company's changed a little bit. But again, we haven't set a specific efficiency goal target. We're focused on that $11 billion.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And I have one other question that I wanted to kind of see if you can walk through in the sense of the mortgage putbacks. It's really kind of a 3-layered question. I hate to throw this at you. But one is, are the primary reasons for the deficiencies, can you kind of highlight why, we're dealing with agencies, which was a very regulated process, we're still seeing that they can throw back at us these deficient loans or the delinquent loans because of paperwork and deficiency in the process. Have those issues changed at all, so did you see a year ago different issues than we're seeing today or are they about the same? And then lastly, what would be your guess in the sense of what percent of the originations we did? To me, this is the critical assumption. I would have the deficiencies that are out there. So if we take a sample of a 1,000 loans, where we see that the deficiencies have been getting back to us with a 30% or the 40% of the loans. What's kind of the range that you think the loans that we're originating would have in the sense of deficiencies?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "So a lot of questions there Marty, which I appreciate. That's okay, it's okay. I think that when you think about the kind of the context of the repurchase demands that we're seeing, there isn't anything really new. I think that what we've seen is a steady review by Freddie Mac and then Fannie Mae during this year accelerated its view. But the issues are really not that different. And from our perspective, as we look at our portfolio, it has much more to do with vintage than anything. And we're slowly but surely kind of working our way through the vintages. The repurchases was pretty flat. Our losses were down for the quarter. In terms of the answer to your bigger question, what I'd like to do on that one, Marty, is just punt and have our IR folks get with our mortgage folks and get back to you because they're going to provide you with a better answer than I'm going to.", "John G. Stumpf", "I just think that percentage if we could look at some sample size, would give us some subset that we're dealing with, that kind of puts an upper bound which in my mind, we have to be approaching after the agencies have gone through 2 and 3 years of looking at this stuff. Unless they're coming up with new stuff, eventually they're going to run out. And it seems like we're, at some point, you're going to approach that number.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I look forward to getting to that point too.", "John G. Stumpf", "Marty, the biggest thing in 2006 to '08 was stated income. I mean, that was -- and of course, that's all changed since 2008, so. But we'll get back to you on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to kind of ask about the mortgage bank. You had obviously great revenue numbers this quarter particularly on the production side and great production numbers for this quarter. Usually, that tends to follow through it to good revenues in Q4. Can you talk a little bit about the margin on production and anything else that might be impacting the mortgage bank as we look at first quarter?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. I think that the margin was up from the third quarter. It was up to 190 basis points from about 134 in the third quarter. And that's something that you see typically in periods of increased demand. And as we've mentioned, we've taken share so that's good. I don't know where the margin is going to be in the first quarter. Clearly, 190 is very attractive. We hope that it continues to be in that range. It might. It might not.", "John G. Stumpf", "Just as a comment about the Mortgage business, we like the Mortgage business. We like that business. And we have a -- we've been taking share in that business. For 2/3 of Americans, it's the most significant financial asset they'll have. If you're going to be in the consumer business, we believe you have to be good at the mortgage business and it's a balanced business. So again, I can't predict where volumes and originations are going to go. But we believe this is a strong business for our company and we like it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions on the investment bank. The market share gains that you're seeing in the investment bank, can you just -- I mean is that due to any one particular activity or segment? If you could just give us a little color about that.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, it's not, Nancy. I think it's just reflective of the fact that it's a different competitive environment, number one. Number two, we have many more relationships than we had a few years ago. And we've got a great team and so they're out providing advice and service to those relationships but it was really pretty broad based. It's not for one specific product or trading activity or industry. It's really reflective of the fact that when we think this is a good business for us and we think we can continue to grow it, but we're going to grow it in our way that's very focused on risk and very focused on providing the right product and service to the client.", "John G. Stumpf", "It's mostly about us doing more with existing customers. We've already had a relationship. We already lent them money. We already did something with them. And now, because we have 15,000 brokers that are able to help sell a debt issuance or an equity offering. As Tim mentioned, we have great folks who play team ball.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "My add-on, my second question will be just an add-on to that. I mean you guys clearly have benefited in quarters like this quarter from not being identified as a capital market/investment banking company. And I guess my question would be, how big a market share do you actually ever want to have or how big do you want the investment bank to be in relation to the rest of the company to continue that premium, I think, you're getting for not being identified as an investment bank?", "John G. Stumpf", "So, Nancy, here's how I think about that. I think, first of all, we love the capability of our people and -- but we think of investment banking or capital markets as another product, another arrow we have in our quivers. We sit down with medium-sized companies and large companies. This is a product and a service that we have that we believe can help them succeed financially. If they choose us for that, that's terrific. If they choose us to do their stock transfer business or treasury management instead of that, that's also terrific. I'm not driven by league tables around here. I'm driven by conference room tables. I want to see us sitting around a table helping customers. So if we grow because we're helping customers, terrific. If we don't grow because their business isn't there but we're getting paid a different way, that's also terrific. And that's where I think we are fundamentally different. We don't have a standalone Head of Corporate Finance that reports to me that has a league table goal. I could care less about that. It's a product that reports into our overall commercial business. They're very good people, they do terrific work. I can't tell you how excited I am about the kind of -- the way they play team ball and work around here.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "John, I'd like to get your perspective on one other thing as well. Jamie Dimon said a few days ago that given the stringency of this stress test, the CCAR, the 13% unemployment, et cetera, et cetera. He expected after you get the results of that and he implied that he does not think there will be capital raising needed on the part of major American banks as a result. Do you hope that, that would be the definitive word on capital? Do you expect that -- do you have that same expectation?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, I don't know other banks as well as he knows other banks. So I know this company. And we surely believe we're in a good spot. But I would make a general comment. What we've been through the last 3 years in the U.S., there's been a lot of capital grown, organically and just through earnings and a lot of capital was raised. The industry is far stronger than it's been in the past. And it takes strong banks and a strong financial system to support a growing economy. This country is in a much better position than a lot of our European counterparts because of the strength of the banks. So I don't know what the stress test is going to show for each institution. I don't have a vision of that. But I know in our case, I don't worry a lot about our capital to support growth in this for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I had a couple of questions. One is on the excess liquidity that you have. Can you just give us what number you calculate that to be?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "We don't really calculate an excess liquidity number at the company, Betsy. I think that it ebbs and flows based upon deposit growth and the opportunities we see in terms of loan growth and acquisitions and investing the securities portfolio. So I mean, I wish I could give you a specific answer but that's not the way we think about it.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So I guess, the reason I asked that question is I'm thinking about your firepower for investing in loans going forward. Do you feel like that rate of change is decelerating or accelerating?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I think it's about the same. As we talked about, we got a tremendous amount of deposit growth in the third quarter. We got a lot of deposit growth in the fourth quarter when you think about it, we're up $30 billion in one quarter and then turn the clock back and how that would feel 2 or 3 years ago. But we've got more than enough dry powder to take advantage of the organic growth that we're seeing from our customers, which is strong as well as look at any acquisitions. But as John said, we're going to look at a lot of acquisitions. We may make none of them, we may make a lot but we feel good about where we are from a liquidity standpoint.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Can you just give us a sense of what your hurdle rates are for the kind of loans you're seeing? You mentioned earlier on the call that you've been seeing a lot of opportunities, you're being selective. Can you just give us a sense as to whether or not your hurdle rates have changed or what they are for the C&I loan book for example?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "So I'd rather not be specific about what our hurdle rates because if we're in a competitive situation, then our competitors might know what we're trying to solve for. But I can tell you, as we look at the portfolios that we purchased today, those portfolios have been higher-quality portfolios and the yields have been consistent with our existing commercial real estate portfolio. We really don't -- we don't have a specific hurdle rate that we would necessarily apply to every portfolio or every business because the risk in those businesses and portfolios can be different. You got to do it kind of deal by deal, opportunity by opportunity, just like when you underwrite a new loan that you look at the risk to that existing customer. And also, Betsy, we bring other things. We bring, when we do sit down with a potential seller, we also want to get paid for the trust these folks have in us that we'll complete the deal, and that we have the capacity to complete the deal. We don't re-trade it. So these are all, these all add into the mix. And in some cases, we're not even the highest bidder when we get deals.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Sure, okay. And then lastly on C&I, the average is up nicely around 4% to 4.5%, 4.6%. Q-on-Q, the end of period was up a little bit less, just under 2%. So I guess -- and that's in an environment based on the HA data that were showing accelerating C&I EOP into the end of the quarter. So did you see competition kind of heating up and you're backing off? Or opportunity just wasn't just as great? Can you just explain why the EOPs are different?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. I think the important thing is to appreciate that you shouldn't get too focused on what happens quarter-to-quarter because you can have a lot of the activity that happens over the quarter. I would not be concerned about our ability to grow commercial loans at all.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Was there originally a pullback a little bit relative to what we saw from the HA? Was it a function of the competition that you see?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, no, no. We didn't necessarily pull back. A lot of it can just be timing. I mean we have a bunch of loans that and transactions you're working on that could, you think might close toward the end of the year and they don't. They close in the first part of the next year or the  next quarter.", "John G. Stumpf", "And there's also some seasonality here also.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So your average growth rates are better for forecast than you think than EOP?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Most of my questions have been answered but I just want to follow-up on the last one about loan growth. If I look at your end of period loans and exclude the $5.6 billion in reclassifications and then the $3.6 billion in purchased average bank loans, I have the quarter-on-quarter loan balances essentially flat, which suggests that your organic growth is essentially offsetting your portfolio, your run-off portfolio decline. Is that a fair way to think about where you are right now? Or is that understating what's going on?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No. I think it understates what's going on. I think the important thing from our perspective, Fred, is that we've got the ability to grow loans in various loan types, as well as make acquisitions. And depending upon the timing in the quarter or any given quarter, some might be growing faster than others. And I really think you've got to think about it as a total of all of them. And I wouldn't look at loan growth that we had from acquisition as being a bad thing. That's just part of the opportunities that we have to grow.", "John G. Stumpf", "And only a couple of billion of it showed up in the fourth quarter, so you can't look at all of the purchase. Some of that was on the third quarter. So there was actual growth in the fourth quarter.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. Just one more, Tim. Just looking at the yield on the security, you probably already covered this. The yield on the security portfolio has come down fairly significantly over the last year and even in the quarter-on-quarter. Is that just inherent in the flat yield curve environment? And just in terms of the opportunities to invest in securities, inherently lower yielding is just what you face right now?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, yes. I think that's right. I mean, I think that the rate of decline is slowing just a little bit but that's a very fair characterization, which again is why we're focusing on net interest income as opposed to just the yield.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just one last follow-up on the drivers to the growth on the C&I side. Do you have any color on kind of the relative strength of the different segments, be it kind of large corporate or syndicated middle markets, small business and just as, is there any one area where you're seeing better opportunities to take share?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, it's more on the type of business as opposed to the size. If you look at anybody or any company involved in the commodities, they're doing quite well and because commodity prices are up, there's lending opportunities there. Agriculture is pretty good, energy is pretty good. So if you -- and manufacturing actually is doing quite well. On the other side, if it's around residential real estate, not so good. So it depends more on that than on size.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And any comments just broadly on how  pricing's holding in?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Pricing continues to be, to hold in pretty well during the quarter.", "John G. Stumpf", "And think of our pricing. We price at the relationship level. So it's not only the price on the loan, it's the price on the treasury business, the 401(k) business, the stock transfer business and a whole bunch of other things. So we think it's  probably differently than a lot of other companies.", "John G. Stumpf", "And thank you all for joining us. Again, we were proud of what our team did in the fourth quarter of 2011 and we're excited about 2012. Talk to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will review first quarter results and answer your questions. ", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website at wellsfargo.com. ", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our outstanding results for the first quarter demonstrate the strength of our franchise and the benefit of our diversified business model. Our ability to meet our customers' financial needs throughout our geographic footprint and broadly diversified businesses is clearly reflected in our results. ", "Let me quickly review some of the highlights of the first quarter. We grew revenue to $21.6 billion, up 6% from a year ago. We generated net income after tax up 13% and EPS up 12% from a year ago. Pretax preprovisioned profits increased 14% from a year ago. We had positive operating leverage and our efficiency -- expense efficiency ratio improved by 250 basis points from a year ago. We grew our retail banking cross-sell ratio to a record 5.98 products per household. Credit quality continued to improve with our charge-off ratio declining to 1.25%, the lowest level since 2007. Our profitability ratios reflect these strong results with our return on assets growing to 1.31%, up 8 basis points from a year ago, the highest it's been in 4 years. Our return on equity increased to 12.14%, up 16 basis points from just a year ago. ", "We continued to grow capital with our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III increasing to 7.81%. We are extremely pleased that during the first quarter, we were able to reward our shareholders by increasing our dividend for the second consecutive year with an 83% increase to $0.22 per share, per quarter. ", "Wells Fargo's performance has benefited from our diversified business model and the improvements in the economy. We remain focused on our commitment to do all we can to help customers and the overall economy. We are helping homeowners stay in their homes with over 740,000 active trial or completed mortgage modifications since the beginning of 2009. We've also helped nearly 5.6 million customers secure new low-rate loans for home purchases or refinancing since the beginning of 2009. ", "In the first quarter, we successfully completed integrating the largest and most complex bank merger in our nation's history. It took us 3 years, but we did it the right way, on time and under budget. We believe our strong results this quarter are just the beginning of our ability to capitalize on all of the tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us as we move forward as One Wells Fargo, serving our 70 million customers coast-to-coast. ", "Now Tim, our CFO, will provide more details on our financial results.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the presentation included in the first half of the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2, and then John and I will take your questions. ", "As John highlighted, we achieved very strong first quarter results with record earnings of $4.2 billion, up 3% from the fourth quarter and up 13% from a year ago. Earnings per share were a record $0.75, up 3% from last quarter and 12% from a year ago. This is our ninth consecutive quarter of EPS growth. That's real consistency. ", "Our ability to grow our bottom line consistently during a time when the industry has faced many challenges reflects the underlying strength and the benefit of our diversified business model. This quarter was no different. As Slide 3 shows, we have a diversified loan portfolio, balanced spread and fee income and our sources of noninterest income are well diversified. ", "Let me start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our results this quarter, and I'll add more detail later in my remarks. While total loans declined this quarter, our core loan portfolio, which excludes the planned runoff from the liquidating portfolio, was up $1 billion from the fourth quarter. Our securities portfolio grew $7.7 billion as we continued to deploy cash into longer-term investments and benefit from continued strong deposit growth, with deposit balances up $10.2 billion. ", "Now let's turn to the income statement. Revenue grew by $1 billion or 5% from the fourth quarter on strong mortgage results and fee growth throughout our diversified businesses while net interest income was stable. As expected, our expenses remained elevated in this quarter, but we generated positive operating leverage. We expect second quarter expenses to decline by $500 million to $700 million and that our quarterly expenses will continue to decline over the remainder of the year. ", "Now let me cover our results in more detail. As shown on Page 6, period-end loans were down $3.1 billion from the fourth quarter as we continue to reduce the size of our liquidating portfolio. Excluding the runoff of $4.1 billion of liquidating loans, our core loan portfolio grew by $1 billion. Commercial loans grew $299 million as growth in C&I was partially offset by lower commercial real estate and foreign loans. Loan growth benefited from $858 million of loans acquired from Burdale Capital Finance during the quarter. As we head into the second quarter, we have a nice tailwind for increasing loans with the announced acquisition of BNP Paribas' North American energy lending business, which includes approximately $3.9 billion of loans outstanding and is expected to close later this month. ", "Consumer loans declined $3.4 billion from the fourth quarter, as growth in our auto and our private student lending portfolios was offset by lower junior lien mortgages and seasonally lower credit card balances. Average loan balances were flat linked quarter, but we had growth in many portfolios. We believe we're well positioned to grow loans during the rest of the year. ", "We had strong deposit growth with average core deposits up $5.6 billion from the fourth quarter and up $73.7 billion or 9% from a year ago. Core deposits were 113% of average loans. Average core checking and savings deposits were up 12% from a year ago and were 93% of core deposits. Consumer checking accounts were up a net 2.5% from a year ago. We have successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit costs for 6 consecutive quarters. Deposit costs in the first quarter were 20 basis points, down 2 basis points from the fourth quarter and down 10 basis points from a year ago. ", "Tax equivalent net interest income was stable from the fourth quarter, with average earning assets essentially unchanged and the NIM was up 2 basis points. That said; we expect continued pressure on our NIM as a result of the current interest rate environment. The benefit of disciplined deposit pricing, with interest-bearing deposit costs down 3 basis points in the quarter and the redeployment of short-term investments into longer-term securities largely offset the expected runoff of higher-yielding loans and investments during the quarter. ", "Noninterest income increased $1 billion from the fourth quarter, up 11%. This growth was broad-based and reflected very strong mortgage results. Mortgage banking revenue increased $506 million, up 21% from the fourth quarter, driven by strong originations and higher margins. Mortgage originations were $129 billion in the first quarter, up 8% from the fourth quarter. Only 15% of our origination volume this quarter was from HARP. The unclosed mortgage pipeline was solid at $79 billion at quarter end. Mortgage results included a $343 million reduction in the value of MSRs to incorporate a higher discount rate. Market-sensitive revenues were up $458 million from the fourth quarter and included $364 million in equity gains. These equity gains were up $303 million from last quarter but were in line with our quarterly average last year of $370 million. Trading gains increased $210 million from the last quarter, reflecting the benefit from $109 million of higher deferred compensation plan investment results, which is offset in expense, and stronger core customer accommodation trading. Trust and investment fees increased $181 million, up 7% from the fourth quarter from higher retail brokerage transaction activity and asset-based fees. ", "Turning to expenses. Recall that we indicated last quarter that costs will remain elevated in the first quarter. Noninterest expense increased $485 million from the fourth quarter, driven primarily by 2 factors, higher personnel expenses and operating losses. Now let me walk you through the first quarter expenses in more detail on Page 11. ", "Employee compensation expense increased for 3 primary reasons: first, we had $476 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching; second, we had $120 million of higher deferred compensation expenses, which are offsetting revenue; and finally, we had $166 million of higher commission and incentive compensation expenses, driven by revenue growth in mortgage, retail brokerage and insurance. In addition, we had $314 million of higher operating losses, primarily due to additional litigation accruals for various legal matters. Offsetting these increases was $262 million of lower merger integration and Compass severance expenses and $329 million in lower expenses from seasonally higher fourth quarter levels in equipment and foreclosed asset expense and other benefits including Compass cost saves. ", "As shown on Page 12, we expect second quarter expenses to decline by $500 million to $700 million, driven by the elimination of merger integration expenses and lower personnel expense, and we expect expenses to continue to decline over the remainder of the year. As you will recall, when we first provided you detail on our expense initiative in the second quarter of last year, we stated that we expect that our fourth quarter 2012 expenses to be within the range of $10.75 billion to $11.25 billion, with the target of $11 billion. This target assumed a certain level of revenue growth, which we now expect to be stronger than we originally assumed, obviously a very good thing. Because of expected higher revenue, we're now targeting fourth quarter 2012 expenses to be $11.25 billion. We have continued to make progress on reducing expenses through our Compass expense initiative. For example, noncustomer-facing team members and contractors in high-cost geographies are down 11% from the beginning of 2011, and we've reduced technology expense by 3% despite meaningful growth in IT-related volumes. ", "Turning briefly to our segment results starting on Page 13. Community Banking earned $2.3 billion in the first quarter, benefiting from strong mortgage results. Retail banking sales continued to generate strong growth, with core product sales up 9% from a year ago. Retail banking cross-sell grew to 5.98 products per household, up from 5.76 a year ago. Cross-sell growth occurred throughout the franchise. With the East cross-sell 86 basis points lower than the West, we have plenty of opportunity to earn more business from our customers in the East. Credit card penetration in our retail banking households continued to increase to 30%, up from 27% a year ago. We generated record consumer auto originations in the first quarter of $6 billion, up 25% from fourth quarter and 10% from a year ago. ", "Wholesale Banking earned $1.9 billion in the first quarter, up $232 million or 14% from the fourth quarter. This strong bottom line growth reflects record revenue of $6 billion, up 11% from the fourth quarter, which was broad-based across our diversified commercial businesses. Wholesale Banking also generated record pretax preprovision profit and positive operating leverage, with the expense efficiency ratio improving to 50.6% in the first quarter compared with 54.2% in the fourth quarter. Loan growth was broad-based, reflecting new and existing customer growth and our ability to capitalize on acquisition opportunities in this environment. For example, we have grown our Commercial Banking portfolio for 20 consecutive months from new originations and increased line utilization from our middle-market customers. During the past year, we have completed $4.8 billion of loan portfolio acquisitions. And this quarter, we announced the acquisition of $3.9 billion on loans outstanding from BNP Paribas, which we expect to close later this month. ", "Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $296 million. Excluding the fourth quarter's gain on the sale of H.D. Vest of $153 million, earnings would have increased 34% from last quarter. Revenue increased 1% from the fourth quarter. Again excluding the fourth quarter H.D. Vest gain, revenue grew 6% from last quarter. This growth was driven by higher asset-based fees, strong brokerage transaction revenue and securities gains in the brokerage business. Managed account assets were up $26 billion or 10% from the fourth quarter, driven by strong net flows in market performance. First quarter net flows reflect recovery to levels last seen in the second quarter of 2011. Our continued focus on helping customers succeed financially drove cross-sell to 10.16, up from 9.85 a year ago. ", "Credit quality continued to improve this quarter as shown on Page 16. Net charge-offs were down $245 million from the fourth quarter and were 1.25% of average loans, down 48 basis points from a year ago and the lowest charge-off rate since 2007. Provision expense was $2 billion, including a $400 million reserve release in the first quarter. Absent significant deterioration of the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases in 2012. ", "Nonaccrual loans increased $722 million from the fourth quarter. This entire increase was a result of the reclassification of $1.7 billion of performing junior lien loans and lines to nonaccrual status in accordance with interagency guidance issued to the industry this quarter related to junior liens behind a delinquent senior lien loan. Only 12% of these reclassified junior liens were 30 days or more past due. This policy change had an immaterial impact on our earnings since the loans were already considered in our loan loss allowance and the related interest income impact was minimal. Absent this policy change, nonaccrual loans would have been down $948 million from the fourth quarter with declines in all loan categories. This continues the trend of improvement that started in the fourth quarter of 2010. Loans 90 days or more past due were down $412 million or 20% from the fourth quarter, with declines in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Early-stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also improved from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonality but are also significantly better than a year ago as portfolio performance continued to improve. ", "We service $1.8 trillion of residential mortgages. We like the cross-sell opportunities this provides, and it also positions us well to benefit from refinance waves like we're experiencing now since existing customers usually give us the first chance when they refinance. On Page 18, we highlight why we believe our servicing portfolio is the best in the industry. 71% of our servicing portfolio is service for the agency; only 5% are private securitizations, and 79% of those were prime at origination, and over 1/2 were originated prior to 2006. Most of the loans we securitized were jumbo loans. We do not have private label option ARM securities nor do we have a significant amount of home equity securitizations. ", "Reflecting the quality of our servicing portfolio, our delinquency and foreclosure rate was nearly 400 basis points lower than the industry average, excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recent publicly available data. Our delinquency -- our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 6.89% in the first quarter, down from 7.2% a year ago and from a peak of 8.96% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The repurchase reserve increased by $118 million in the first quarter. Total repurchase demands were down $154 million from the fourth quarter, down approximately 25% from a year ago and down 57% from the peak in the second quarter of 2010. ", "As shown on Page 20, our capital position continued to improve, with our Tier 1 common equity ratio increasing to 9.95% and our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under current Basel III proposals growing to 7.81%, up 31 basis points from the fourth quarter. We've been able to grow our capital ratios while rewarding our shareholders by increasing our first quarter dividend by 83%. We purchased 7.6 million shares in the first quarter, primarily through a forward repurchase transaction entered into during the fourth quarter. We called $875 million of 6.38% trust preferred securities in the first quarter, which we redeemed today. ", "In summary, our diversified business model, focused on basic banking, generated another quarter of outstanding results with record earnings, robust revenue and pretax preprovision growth, positive operating leverage and continued improvement in credit quality. These results drove our ROA to 1.31% and increased our ROE to 12.14%, and our capital ratios continued to grow. We increased our dividend rate to $0.22 per share, which we paid to our shareholders in the first quarter. ", "We are well positioned to continue to grow, ending the quarter with a strong mortgage pipeline, and we are focused on capitalizing on acquisition opportunities, increasing our cross-sell, growing our loans and deposits and reducing our expenses. We look forward to sharing more details on our growth opportunities at our Investor Day next month. I will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I wondered, Tim, could you give us a sense of the yields you're getting on some of the loan portfolio purchases you've made to date and how additive they are to the margin? And also, are you still seeing a good pipeline of opportunities and just how competitive is the market now for these acquisitions?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Sure, good question. When you look at the yields that we received on our commercial real estate loans that we bought last year in a number of transactions, they were more or less consistent with the rest of the portfolio. These were generally high-quality loans. As you recall, a good portion of those were customers that we already knew. So I would say that it was consistent with those yields. And then in terms of the Burdale Capital Finance portfolio, again, it was pretty consistent, high-quality stuff with the Capital Finance portfolio. In terms of how competitive the market is, I wouldn't say that it's really changed a whole lot. I mean, in any situation that we're seeing, that we're interested in, there's at least a handful of competitors and everybody wants to grow, so you've got to pay an appropriate price.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one other is that you mentioned HARP accounted for around 15% of the origination volume in the first quarter. Do you see that rising much and having a greater impact on your business? And beyond that, just in general, what are your thoughts on the current strength of the housing market?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, John, do you want to...", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes. I want to tell you, on the housing side, we're seeing improvement. And we've been seeing that for some time, but we're seeing it more. And it depends on the region of the country, strength, of course, and the different price points. But when you have the dynamics of higher rental rates and lower home values at great financing rates, there's a point in time where the market's going to clear and you're going to see improvement. I think we're getting very close to that tipping point, and we've seen it in some of the markets. In some markets like Northern California, Texas, the District of Columbia, in that area, stronger. Other areas would be a bit weaker, but we are seeing improvement there. With respect to HARP, you're right. 15% of our volume was HARP. But we have a pretty good pipeline there. HARP 2 is an opportunity for very high loan-to-value or \"underwater\" from an equity perspective, current borrowers to refinance. And we're going to see more volume in that.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "And John, maybe let me just add on to that. And that is, Joe, most of the volume that we saw from HARP was from HARP 1. And again, about 15% of the total fundings in the first quarter. So we're just beginning to see the results of HARP 2 start to kick in. How long that continues, we don't know. But right now, the mortgage business is very good for us.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I was wondering about if you could give us a little color on your approach to share buybacks. Are you purely price-sensitive? Or does it kind of depend on what other uses of capital you have? Could you give us some color on how you think about the buybacks?", "John G. Stumpf", "Sure. We've been very consistent with our view of rewarding shareholders. First of all, those of you who know us well know that we are very shareholder-friendly and -centric. There's a number of dynamics that are going on right now. We are still buying back TruPS. We have increased our dividend by 83%. We are going to -- we have approval to do more repurchase this year than last year. We're very happy we went through the CCAR with no objections to our plan. And we want to have enough capital around so we can grow this company. And we believe we are a growth company. So we will buy back when it's opportunistic for us to do that. But again, we have all of those other issues in play. And I think balance, consistency and a friendly view around rewarding our stockholders. So again, we have great emphasis on that; will really dictate what we do.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And a question for Tim on expenses. Tim, any color on the pace of expense decline throughout the year from the second quarter, third and fourth? Does it pick up steam? Or do you envision that kind of spread evenly throughout the quarters as we go towards that fourth quarter goal?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, John, a good question. Again, nothing's really fundamentally changed as we think about expenses from the prior quarter. I mean, we're committed to reducing our expenses and improving operating efficiency. Again, we feel good about the $500 million to $700 million. But in terms of the specifics as it relates to the third and fourth quarter, obviously, to get down to the $11.25 billion target that we set, it's going to have to be spread pretty evenly. But again, we feel confident in our ability to do it and are looking forward to it.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes, John, I'd like to add one thing to that. We are absolutely committed. But if we get to the fourth quarter and if for whatever reason there is all kinds of revenue available in a certain business or a number of businesses, we're not going to be slavish to any one number. We're going to do the right thing for the stockholder, and we're going to make sure that we continue to produce the kind of results you want us to do. But we are committed to that number. We have plans in place. We know we're going to get it, but we're not going to be slavish to it.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Understood. Okay. And then Tim, is there any Compass savings that go beyond the fourth quarter? Are there savings that you'd be working on for the year 2013 out of Compass or anything else?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Oh, sure. Absolutely. I mean, I think that's a really important point. It's not as if we put together an expense focus and when we get to the fourth quarter and just stop being focused on improving operating efficiencies. I mean, I think that post the merger integration, it really gives us an opportunity to focus on operating leverage and improved efficiencies. And we'll continue to do that into '14, '15 and '16. And we're not going to stop.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes, absolutely. And because the key here is if we're more efficient on things that customers don't want to pay for, we can add sales people, add more value to things that customers want to have, so we can compete for revenues and grow our franchise and do all the things that add value.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a question on Basel III for Tim, I guess. Tim, your pro forma ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets under Basel III is high; it seems like almost 100%. Where's the biggest inflation of your risk-weighted assets coming from under Basel III? Is it kind of the sub-investment grade securities that get hit pretty hard? And is there an opportunity to mitigate that over time?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I don't know if I would describe it as an inflation of our numbers. I mean, we go through what we think is an appropriate review of all of our assets and try to compare them to what the Basel -- what we think the Basel III rules are going to be. Others, it may be where you're going that others have different ratios, I don't know how anybody else is doing. I know how we're doing it, and I think we're doing it in an appropriate way. Having said that, obviously, because it's an important ratio, we're going to look at our risk-weighted assets and make sure that we're getting the good return on all of our risk-weighted assets as we roll into Basel III. But I think the other important point is that regardless of what the risk-weighted asset level is, capital's not an issue for us, right? We're at 7.81%. The minimum requirement for us, we know, is 7%. Maybe there's going to be a SIV buffer, maybe not. And so we're not concerned about -- we're not overly concerned about that ratio, but we spend a lot of time making sure that it's calculated correctly.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And does the treatment of MSR under Basel III affect at all how you decide or not decide to grow the business? Or will decisions to grow mortgage servicing or not be independent kind of capital treatment? I just want to get that. Is that the factor in how you look at the MSR?", "John G. Stumpf", "John, first of all, we love the mortgage business. We love it because our customers love it. 2/3 of our customers are in the mortgage business, and I don't know how you can be in the consumer banking business if you're not in the mortgage business. Along with checking accounts and mortgages, that drives a lot of the household acquisition. And once a customer does a mortgage with us, great things happen. They stay longer, they buy more products so that's great. And in our mortgage business, specifically on the MSR, as you know, it's a balanced business. Origination on one side and servicing on the other side, and they move in opposite directions with what happens in interest rates. Yes, there is an element of the MSR that we think is not -- we don't agree with the treatment under Basel because we think it's as good an asset as you can have. But that being said, if rates do rise and the mortgage servicing asset goes up in value and less of it gets counted for capital or there's a bigger exclusion, other great things happen in the company. There's offsets and there's balances. We're not going to let one ratio and one issue like that drive us away from the business that we think is a good thing for customers, for our stockholders, for everyone involved here. It's not that we're oblivious to it, and we're looking for other ways to mitigate it. And we spend a lot of time on that. But it's just not a deal stopper around here. We love the business.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "You mentioned that 15% of your total fundings were HARP. Could you just give us a sense of the application volumes that have been HARP-related? And then I just had a follow-up question on the ultimate approval of HARP relative to other apps that you've been seeing.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. The application volumes again were about 15%. HARP 2 was kind of rolled out in the middle of the quarter, and so those applications are up a bit. But I wouldn't describe -- it wasn't a significant portion of the first quarter volume. Our expectation is they're probably going to increase. But again, we think it's a good program. We think it will be helpful. But it's in its early stages. But obviously, given the servicing book that we have, we're going to be a large part of that program.", "John G. Stumpf", "And Betsy, one thing that's a little different about that, you actually have to -- we spend a little more time marketing. You have to actually go and talk with people and help them understand how they qualify and how they fit into the program. And we're doing that. We have feet on the street. We have people available. We have a big retail distribution, and we think it's a -- first of all, we think it's a good thing. It's great to see people who have made their payments every month, even though they're under water or hugely under water. And now to be able to help them put a few hundred dollars extra in their pocket every month, that's terrific.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So a little bit more expensive to get the refi in obviously. But I guess, the question is what is the -- what has the approval rate been? What do you think the approval rate is likely to be relative to other refis, non-HARP refis?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "That's a fair question. But I think we're too new to rate into the HARP 2 program. I think over the next few months, we'll have a better appreciation for that, but I wouldn't want to guess on that one.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a minor question that has to do with loan growth. I know that, that's a priority for you. Given the push-pull in the portfolio where you've got -- some of the portfolio is obviously still in runoff, do you feel that you can drive net loan growth over the next year or so? Or do you have to wait for that runoff portfolio to really shrink a little bit more dramatically before you can anticipate that?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, we think we could continue to drive the growth. I mean, you saw in the third and fourth quarter of last year that we saw point-to-point growth in both quarters. This quarter, we were down a bit. But we feel good about our ability to grow loans organically as well. And in addition, as we mentioned, we've been active from an acquisition standpoint. So any quarter might be a little bit up, a little bit down, but over time, we feel confident about our ability to grow the loan portfolio. And we don't think we're going to need to wait until the liquidating portfolio just declines to a small number.", "John G. Stumpf", "And Betsy, the other thing is in the first quarter, there is some seasonality. So we typically see card balances coming down in the first quarter, and then you see that change over the rest of the year. So we believe we can grow organically here. And as Tim mentioned, it will be lumpy, but we have lots of opportunity.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. Then I guess, just a last question on this topic is competition. So clearly, there's competition with other banks. There's also competition with the capital markets, right, because interest rates are so low. So I'm just wondering how do you deal with that, particularly in the commercial real estate and the C&I space, where your borrowers might be able to access longer-term funds cheaper than they have historically. Would they choose to be doing that as opposed to drawing down C&I lines or doing a CRE...", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, they might. No, it's a fair question. I think depending upon what's going on in the capital markets, you can see kind of an ebb and flow back and forth. And I think from our perspective, look, even though we want to grow loans, the most important thing is do the right thing for the customer. And because of the fact that we've got a broader base of product and services today, including an investment banking capability, unlike maybe where we were a few years ago, we can help them do that. So we sit down with our customers and give them our best recommendations. If it's a commercial real estate customer, whether or not we could do it on-balance sheet or whether we could do it in a CMBS market, so on and so forth. So there's no question, there's always going to be competition from the capital markets. It was a little bit less in the third quarter of last year, a little bit more in the fourth quarter, probably a little bit more steady state this quarter, but you're going to see that ebb and flow.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I guess, on the $1.7 billion reclass of home equities, I totally realize you guys have already reserved for it. But just in thinking about what the loss content on those loans might be, I guess, Chase kind of put out there a 55% cume loss rate on these kind of high-risk seconds. Is that a reasonable guess for the type of reserves you would already have against that bucket?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. Our experience hasn't been 55%. I think that our view is that we needed to be consistent with this interagency guidance. We had taken into consideration the fact that these were junior lien loans behind sub-performing first for an extended period of time. This isn't the first time that we took that into consideration in our loan loss reserve, so we think that we're adequately reserved. But we haven't seen a disproportionate incremental loss rate on this portfolio relative to others. But we've taken into consideration the loan loss reserve and we have for a while.", "John G. Stumpf", "The biggest driver on losses here is jobs. If people have income and if they have work, that drives it more than anything else. But also, there's no question that once they don't have a job, the severity is almost complete. I mean, so in other words, you lose most of it. But we're not running at those kind of numbers.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And then I know you've touched on a lot of the different aspects of HARP. But just one follow-up would be on how does it affect the gain on sale outlook for the mortgage business over the remainder of the year?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I think it's going to be just a function of volume. I mean, I think we -- if the HARP 2 is successful, it will continue to increase volume. The margins that we've had have been good. But I think generally, they've been a little bit overstated in the market in terms of media reports and the like. Again, HARP 2 loans are good, the program seems to be catching on, it's in its early stage. And the way that we price those loans is as similar to any other refinance.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "If I could sneak in just one last one, I guess, going back to John's question on the risk asset-weighted inflation. I agree with everything you said. But maybe the thing that's not obvious based your business mix is the $346 billion higher risk-weighted assets under Basel III versus Basel I as of March 31. And how much of those -- that risk-weighted asset difference between Basel III and Basel I is something that would be permanent versus how much of it is from things that can be mitigated or reduced over time like subprime MBS that might be on the books or things like that?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, so let's step back for a minute. I guess I'm disagreeing a little bit with the premise that somehow there's inflation in how we're calculating our risk-weighted assets under Basel III. The rules for Basel I and Basel III are just different. You've got to take into consideration things like operating risk. You've got to take into consideration counterparty risk. And everybody's doing that in the industry; we're doing that. And so again, we feel comfortable with our calculation. We're not going to do anything inappropriate in terms of doing that calculation. Having said that, we're going to make sure that it's appropriate. But again, we're not overly concerned about our risk-weighted asset level just because of the fact that we've got adequate capital in the country -- or company, excuse me.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Could you give us a sense of how you're treating any associated seconds if you're refinancing a first under the HARP program, particularly if there is an underwater situation?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, we normally look at the exposure together or in tandem. But in terms of any additional specifics, we can get back to you. We'll talk to our mortgage folks and follow up. But I don't think there's anything special going on.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, I'm just wondering, I understand that the $1.7 billion increase in the home equity problem loans was part of a reclassification. But is the improvement generally in home equity problem loans for the industry going to be stagnant as perhaps some of the underwater home equity loans are charged off as the first are refinanced under HARP? Am I thinking about this the wrong way or...", "John G. Stumpf", "No, I think you said -- here's how we think about it. Every time, anything we can do to help a customer reduce their first mortgage obligations through refinancing to lower rates or modifications of the first, obviously helps the second because it's about the total expense and the debt coverage around that. So as part of how we normally work with customers, we look at with respect to their debt and we work through the refinancing. So the reclassification has really nothing to do with how we're going to work with customers or how we feel about future losses. It's merely an interagency rule that we are honoring. We have seen our home equity losses continue to come down. That's been a function of working through some of the more challenged customers early. And it's also been because of refinancing to lower rates, to taking pressure off plus the improved job situation, employment situation. So all those 3 have helped on the home equity portfolio. And I think we'll see continued improvement there.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And just one last question, it's a follow-up to Joe's question. The loans that were required from BNP, are they going to be in line with the commercial yields on the books today or accretive?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, we haven't acquired them yet. The deal should close this month. When we look at that portfolio, again it's a high-quality portfolio. We're familiar with many of the borrowers, and we have relationships with them right now. We're in a number of the deals, so I would say it's consistent.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So a couple questions. First one is sort of a follow-up to John McDonald's question on the operating cost. And I guess, I'm just trying to think about the trajectory of the decline and how you're describing it. I get the idea of getting to the high end of the range by 4Q on higher revenue. But in the fourth quarter, you were $12.5 billion on costs. You said we're expecting to remain elevated in the first quarter but then decline significantly starting in the second quarter. Now we're up to $13 billion, and you're looking for a $500 million to $700 million decline in the second quarter. That takes us down to $12.3 billion to $12.5 billion on your guidance. So I guess, I'm wondering why is that second quarter number not materially below the fourth quarter number. Do you -- especially given that it won't include a Wachovia integration cost, whereas the fourth quarter included a fairly large one, do you expect more litigation? Or what is it that I'm missing on sort of 2Q versus 4Q?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, Ed, I think that based on what we see in the second quarter, we're comfortable in providing the guidance that our expenses are going to be down between $500 million and $700 million. Could they be a little bit more than that? They could, right? But we're comfortable with that number right now. And again, that number is based upon an expectation of revenues. We feel comfortable -- as we mentioned, we entered this quarter with some nice tailwinds in terms of the mortgage pipeline, as well as some acquisitions that we've mentioned. So could the number be a little bit bigger? It could, but we're comfortable with that range.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But given that you don't -- if we take out Wachovia integration expense from the fourth quarter, it would actually be up somewhat from the fourth quarter ex integration cost. Is that outlook because of higher incentive comp? Or what is it that would be driving that core number up a little bit versus 4Q as opposed to down ex the Wachovia integration in 4Q? I just trying to understand the point where your thoughts are on how that's trending.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. I mean, you're jumping to the conclusion that it will be up. We're saying that we feel comfortable with the $500 million to $700 million guidance. There's always going to be some puts and takes in our expenses as we move through the quarter. But again, we believe that we're going into this quarter with nice revenue, right? And as we've demonstrated this quarter, when you think about it, our revenue was up $1 billion from the fourth quarter. Do you have a little bit more expense related there? Of course, you do. Our revenue was up $1.3 billion from the first quarter last year. Were there a little bit higher expenses? Of course, there were. So we're feeling good about this quarter, right, and we feel good about the $500 million to $700 million. Could it be a little bit higher in terms of the reduction? Sure, it could.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, all right. And then just one more. When I look at the net interest margin and expanding by 2 basis points, what seems to have been sort of the surprise factor was the overall yield on your commercial loan portfolio, going up by 6 basis points from 4.10% to 4.16% in the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Is there anything in there that's abnormal? Or is there any thoughts about what caused the yield on the commercial loan portfolio to go up a little bit linked quarter versus down a little bit?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, I wouldn't say there's anything abnormal in that. I think we're starting to see the yield settle down just a bit. Every quarter, we have some level of volatility in terms of special items that are in the numbers, and you saw some of that last year, too. But there's nothing abnormal in there.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes. And that's actually influenced a little bit by some of the workouts that we do on the commercial side. So that's -- that will bump around a little bit. But I think it's important as long as we're talking about the NIM to mention 2 things. And you know both of these, Ed. First of all, we don't manage the company around the NIM. And secondly, I think still think it's going to be under pressure going forward.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I didn't get a chance to look real closely at sort of how the accretive yield came in. But were there some commercial loan sale gain that sort of impacted -- unmarked commercial loans that sort of impacted that yield at all in the first quarter or not really?", "John G. Stumpf", "It wasn't much. But there's always a little bit here and there.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, that wasn't a driver in terms of the NIM. And in fact, the accretion was actually down a little bit from $552 million to $514 million in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I know you're probably sick of talking about HARP. But as of April 1, I mean, have you guys disclosed how much of HARP-eligible loans is in your servicing portfolio?", "John G. Stumpf", "No.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And secondly, as of April 1, I believe that you can start to refi other people's servicing portfolios under HARP. I'm just wondering, I think the jury's out if that's a smart move or not. Have you made any decision on that yet?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, Paul, how we think about that, first of all, since a lot of HARP loans you get through a marketing, you need to kind of know where people are. It's easier to do your own portfolio than someone else's. That being said, we want to take on all comers, and this is where our cross-sell in the community bank gets very involved, as they talk with customers, and frankly, other parts of the company where we are able -- if someone has a mortgage that's not with us that we can do. But I would say, we'll know more about that as time goes on. But I would bet the biggest part of the HARP 2s that we will do will be for our own portfolio, just pulling [ph] the information.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then going back, because I didn't quite understand the answer, I didn't get it correct, I think. On the HELOC portfolio, of which I believe is like close to $1.6 billion that you moved over, was there other -- $1.7 billion, sorry about that. Was there other loans that where the first is defaulted that are not nonaccruals in the HELOC portfolio?", "John G. Stumpf", "No.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "No. So this is the entire community of loans where the first has been defaulted?", "John G. Stumpf", "Correct.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Correct.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Hopefully, I didn't miss it. I know you commented on NIM being under pressure but growing loans. When we combine those 2 and think about your both capacity and desire to buy some more securities, how does that all shake out for net interest income dollars from here?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I think as John said, we continue to believe that the net interest margins could be under pressure. Having said that, I think that we've got the ability to grow loans organically. We believe that we can do that. The core loans were up again this quarter, a little bit less than in the third and fourth quarter, but we feel confident about our ability to grow our core loans. And one of the other things that I think is important to note is that the diversification in terms of the loan growth this quarter was a little bit better than the third and the fourth quarter because we saw auto loans and student loans growing, whereas in the third and the fourth quarter, it was a little bit more of that focus on Wholesale Banking. As it relates to -- but the other avenue we have obviously to grow loans is through acquisition. We continue to demonstrate that we're active there and we're paying appropriate prices and bringing new customers to the company. In terms of securities purchases, we're going to continue to manage the portfolio as we have very prudently. We're not going too far out under the curve. Having said that, if we got incremental liquidity that's not needed for our customers in terms of loans, we're going to invest appropriately. And you saw our securities increase about $7 billion to $8 billion this quarter, so we'll continue to do that. And then I think the other point to make is just in terms of the input costs, and that is we've been able to continue to grow deposits while reducing our deposit costs. So we feel good about the ability to grow net interest income.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then separately, as we think about the provision expense, I was just looking at one of the slides, over the last few quarters, the provision expense in dollars has been relatively stable. It seems like you still have quite a bit of excess loan loss reserves, most of the credit metrics continue to improve from here or up until here. How do we think about the pace of reserve release going forward?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. That's a fair question. I think we believe that we'll have incremental reserve release, whether -- I'm not 100% sure what the pace is going to be. We don't really make those decisions until the end of the quarter. But we do think based upon the continued improvement in the portfolio, which we've continued to see, that we will have additional reserve release. But it's going to be less than it was last year. I mean, the pace of improvement has slowed down a little bit. I think the important thing is that we've gotten through the point at which the lines of the reduction in the loan loss reserve release and the improvement in charge-offs cross so that what we're seeing is a real kind of buttoned-down provision expense and net charge-off level.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then just lastly, if I could sneak in a third one here. The tax rate calculation was around 35% this quarter. It's averaged probably 25% to 33% the last 3 years. Anything different or just a little more conservative earlier in the year?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, it was up a bit this quarter. And we think that the tax rate for 2012 is going to be higher than last year because we're making more money. But beyond that, I wouldn't read anything into it.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Just to further clarify. So your expense guidance is $250 million higher. And John, you said you're not going to be slavish to any one target. Can you guys commit to having positive operating leverage?", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, absolutely.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "So you're going to miss it, but revenues will be a lot more higher -- or at least higher than that $250 million, no matter how we slice it.", "John G. Stumpf", "We're not saying that.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, we're not going to miss it. Okay, a year ago, we gave guidance, right, 6 quarters ahead and we gave you a range of $10.75 billion to $11.250 billion. But we said then and we said now, those are based upon a certain set of revenue assumptions, so we're going to come in at the high end of the range...", "John G. Stumpf", "Because revenues are at a high.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Because revenues are higher, not because we're executing on our expense reductions.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then separately, John, especially for you, if I asked you 15 years ago what bank this quarter might have some of the best year-over-year growth in investment banking, as you guys said, it's up 20%, a record wholesale and the biggest absolute growth in syndicated loan volume, would you ever have guessed it'd be your company as opposed to JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman, Morgan Stanley or some of these firms that are no longer around? So my question really is, is this mission creep? Is this opportunism? What's changed from going back? And I know you've evolved with your acquisitions, and I'm sure we'll talk more about this at Investor Day. But it seems as though you're getting farther away from what made at least legacy companies strong and you're doing more activities further away from your headquarters. So how should we think about that?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, when I think of 15 years ago, I had a mustache and dark hair, so you're dating me now. But let's think about this, Mike. The company today clearly has evolved. But I think it is a more customer-relevant, safer. Our risk profile is reduced from 15 years ago. And if you think about the business, look at the balance in the business today. But before I get to that, what stayed consistent is we continue to be a relationship business. We're in a relationship, the long-term relationship with our customers. And today, we have more products to offer to these customers to help them succeed financially. We're more balanced. If you look at our income statement, this quarter, 1/2 of the revenue comes from fees for services, 1/2 from the margin. 1/2 comes basically from wholesale and 1/2 from consumer. We now have diversity of geography. So I think if you look at that 15-year period, you should even be happier today than -- and it's safer, more diversified, more customer-focused, more value. And we'll talk about this more at Investor Day. But I think the evolution to that time reinforce what we were trying to do 15 years ago, not moving away from it.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then specifically as it relates to syndicated loans, I'm surprised when I look at first quarter of this year versus first quarter of last year, the biggest dollar amount increase in acting as agent for syndicated loans is Wells Fargo. And I'm just...", "John G. Stumpf", "You know what, Mike, that's a great thing. Why are people coming to -- why are customers coming to Wells Fargo? Because they believe in our model, they believe in the company. They like the people they work with. They know that we've got a strong balance sheet. They know that we're going to be able to deliver for us, right? That's a great thing. It diversifies the business, and it reinforces the model. Everything around here starts with the customer. Why wouldn't we want to help our customers? Why wouldn't we want, if we deal with a large Fortune 500 company and we're doing loan business with them and they want to issue debt to buy a subsidiary or whatever. But why wouldn't we want to help them do that? We happen to have 15,000 terrific retail brokerage people out there, advisors who can help with that and sell this, and we have great people on to help them price the debt or the equity. This is what we ought to be doing.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then last follow-up -- I'll let you finish, too, but we can finish at the Investor Day. But is some of this opportunistic, though? Because the European banks' market share in this area has gone from, what, 37% down to 21% over the past year. So not only, I guess, I'm hearing you say your clients want this more, but is this some Wells Fargo opportunism?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, of course. There are -- some of the foreign banks are retreating to their home countries. The industry has changed in a lot of these areas. And we celebrated our 160th birthday a few weeks ago. We've always evolved. We always have change in product offerings and channels. But what stayed true around here and will continue to stay is that it's all about long-term relationships with our customers, helping them succeed. So when I look at percentage changes from year-over-year or whatever, I don't -- first of all, percentages always have a numerator and denominator, and I don't get too excited about that. What I get excited about is if we keep customers at the center of what we do, great things happen. It always does.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions for you here. Something we haven't heard a lot about lately is Wells Fargo Financial. Could you guys just talk about what the results have been since you've moved or tried to move the Wells Fargo Financial people into the branch?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, those folks -- most of those folks on the production side, many of them went into the banks, and they've become personal bankers. They're helping us serve customers, make loans. So yes, that's been very successful.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "Have you been able to track how many -- how much business you might have lost for people who just don't want to go into a bank branch to get their loan or whatever?", "John G. Stumpf", "We've really not, but what's happened is we actually had more distribution now because we got rid of 700 or 800 stores, but we picked up 3,000 with the acquisition of Wachovia. So I don't -- I've not heard -- as I'm out there on the street, I've not ever heard from anyone that I prefer not going to a bank where I'd prefer going to a finance office. What's changed mostly in that business, Nancy, is that much of what we did in Financial were loan accommodations, where we would take 3 or 4 different loans and be a debt consolidation on homes. And of course, what's happened to home value is that business really changed a lot. But the people we brought over were primarily lenders. They knew that part of the business well, so that helped enculturate even more in our banking stores this idea that we want to also be a great place to borrow money if your credit qualified.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "Right. And my second question sort of goes back to this point, and it incorporates HARP and HAMP and all the other issues that we've had around mortgage banking. But it's an issue -- or it's a question that relates more to moral hazard going forward. We've had all these changes. People have found that they can have their principal reduced, they can have their rates reduced, et cetera, et cetera. So how does that impact your underwriting of a mortgage going forward? Do you have to put a big orange sticker on it saying, \"We really mean this, this is really what the thing is going to be\"? Or I mean, how do you think about that, protecting yourself going forward?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, it's a great question. So a couple things, first of all, to think about. Of the 50 million mortgages in America, about 10 million or 11 million are underwater. And of those 11 million, 90% or so are current. So generally, Americans, by a vast majority, want to pay their bills if they have the income to do it. Secondly, you build your best portfolios, whether it's for your own account or whether you sell it off and keep the servicing, you build your best portfolios after a downturn, not going into a downturn. And when the bubble is expanding, usually you have your worst portfolio builds. And the third thing is on the big yellow sticker, I don't know that -- or the orange sticker. Today, in fact, since really 2008, the mortgage business has retrenched and it's more like it was done prior to 2002 or '03 where there is full documentation, income verification, a proper amount down depending on which program it is. So I'm -- and I think nothing would fix all of this more than a little appreciation in housing and getting to the bottom, which I think we're very close to that point where we're going to see an inflection point here. So I don't know if I answered your question, but that's how we think about it.", "Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division", "So do you think you're just getting a better customer who will treat their mortgage document a bit more carefully or take it more seriously going forward than did some of the people coming into this?", "John G. Stumpf", "Nancy, I think it's a good point. I think everybody involved in a mortgage needs to have skin in the game such that mortgages are good. I mean, that's the originator, that's the borrower, that's the realtor that puts the borrower and whatever, together if it's a purchase. It's the people who package and the rating agencies and the servicing. And mortgages aren't complete until they pay off and it's well done, so it's the whole process. I think everybody is showing more care and diligence today, and that's a good thing.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.", "R. Scott Siefers", "I just had a quick question on the mechanics of the new regulatory guidance in that $1.7 billion that you moved over. So since it's now a nonaccrual, obviously, you don't accrue the interest, but the vast majority is still paying, so the cash is coming in. When you receive that cash, does that go into NII now? Or does it go directly to pay down principal balances on the related loans? How does that work?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Like all nonperforming assets or nonperforming loans, this isn't different. It pays down the principal.", "R. Scott Siefers", "Okay. So there's some -- in your case, it's an extraordinarily small amount, but on a kind of go-forward ramification, I guess, to the earnings stream then.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "It's not material.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.", "Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "This is actually Brian Kleinhanzl on for Fred. So I just had a quick question on the rep and warranty. It looks like the repurchase demands are coming down or have been coming down for the last couple of quarters but the reserve keeps building from here. I mean, is there a target you're trying to get to? Or when can we finally see that the reserves come down for the rep and warranty?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. And fair question. The total demands outstanding both number and balances were down in the first quarter and were down kind of roughly 25% year-over-year. The new agency demands for the more difficult vintages, the '06 to '08 vintages, declined a bit from the fourth quarter. But the additions that we put into the reserve were more or less in line with last quarter. We continue to add to the reserve, do the elevated demands from Fannie. And because of the projected higher mortgage insurance rescissions, Freddie's been in line. So we're hopeful, it's going to come down at some point. But we just haven't seen it come down enough yet so that we would want to reduce the reserve.", "Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on a separate topic, you used to give a disclosure about the excess liquidity that you held on the balance sheet. Haven't seen that in the last couple of quarters. What is it that you think the excess liquidity is right now on the balance sheet? And given that the Basel committee has just come out with saying that there's going to be a large shortfall under a third, Basel III standard, is it -- what is your idea of what that excess liquidity is for you?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, I don't recall -- we'll go back. I don't recall us giving any sort of guidance as to what our excess liquidity is. I can tell you that we've got a lot of liquidity right now, which is terrific. It's allowed us to grow the loan portfolio year-over-year and grow the securities portfolio in a smart way. And we're still working through and the regulators are still working through what the new liquidity guidance is going to be related to Basel III. There's a lot of discussion going on about that. But when you look at our balance sheet, particularly how we're continuing to grow low-cost deposits, we don't have a liquidity issue at all.", "John G. Stumpf", "See, I think that's the key, Brian. When you look at this company, our liquidity is such solid. I mean, can you imagine $900 billion plus of deposits at 20 basis points, and again virtually all of it\u2019s core; a big chunk of it is consumer. So this is just so, so valuable, and so undervalued today, given where interest rates are.", "Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And just a quick question on the deposit costs. I mean, we saw them come down again this quarter basically on that core funding. Is there still room for those to come down in the following quarters? I mean, they're already kind of an industry low. So have you guys think that there's a lot more room?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "You know what, every time we get down to a lower number, we talk to our folks and we ask them to continue to not compete on price, continue to compete on value and relationship. And I think that's one of the primary reasons we're able to continue to reduce cost. Whether or not we're going to be able to continue to do that in the future, I don't know for sure.", "John G. Stumpf", "And you are getting pretty close here, but it's down 10 basis points in a year. I don't think you sat here a year ago and said, \"Could you bring it down 10?\" People would've said, \"I don't think you can.\" So we're always looking to find that right area. But the reason they're coming down is more about the mix as opposed -- we have to compete which we do, but when you have the number of checking or near checking that we have, that's just -- that's magical.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on that last question. In terms of the margin guidance, you had talked about how despite the 2 basis points better this quarter, that we should expect some pressure going forward. Just hoping we can get some color in terms of magnitude. Is it kind of in the low single-digit range? And then it also sounds like despite that, you still feel confident in holding the NII up with loan growth and earning asset growth.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. Andrew, it's a fair question because there's been a lot of volatility in the NIM, which is candidly why we don't manage to it. I don't know what the NIM is going to be this quarter, and I don't know what it's going to be next quarter. What we do know is just the math is that there's pressure on it for sure. We're hopeful that we can continue to relieve that pressure as best we can through a reduction in our deposit costs. But in terms of specifics, I'm not going to provide any guidance because I can't.", "John G. Stumpf", "But Andrew, you're right on the fact that -- forget the margin. Look at net interest income. That's really what drives us because that's the result of the work we do every day of getting new customers and selling them more things and so forth, getting deposits and selling loans. And I wake up and think about that more than I do about the NIM. And there, we think we have good opportunities to continue to produce the kind of things that drive net interest income.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "So is it fair to assume then the confidence in terms of a higher NIM really won't come until the macro backdrop really improves in terms of a higher rate environment? Is that fair or maybe the run-off portfolio slows?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I think it -- I wouldn't say it's confidence. I think it's just more probability. I think it's less likely that the NIM is going to grow. Not impossible because we've been able to grow it a little bit over -- a few basis points in the last couple of quarters since the decline in the third quarter last year. It's just a little bit less likely.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then lastly, just on the -- going back to expenses, in terms of the slight change in terms of the guidance for year end at the upper end now, you had mentioned that, that's driven by higher confidence in revenue. You're feeling better about revenue more than you have before. Can you help us understand exactly where exactly do you feel better about it? Is it really mortgage banking or trading? Or what is it that makes you feel better?", "John G. Stumpf", "Across-the-board.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So no one particular area feeling better in terms of mortgage having greater strength or trading coming in better?", "John G. Stumpf", "No.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I have 3 quick questions. Tim, on the margin guidance in terms of percent or dollar amount, does that take into consideration perhaps a more aggressive TruPS redemptions than just the $875 million announced today or are redeeming today?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, we're getting through really the end of the -- the tail end of the TruPS redemptions that we're going to be doing. I mean, most of the activity occurred last year. So that's -- we'll continue to redeem TruPS in an appropriate way, but it's not going to be as big a driver as it was last year.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. The second thing is gain on sale margins this quarter versus last quarter, do you have those handy on the mortgage side?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, I think it was -- this quarter was, I think, 2.36%. And that's up from 1.9% in the fourth quarter.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, with the robo-signing settlement, do you have discretion on who you modify? In other words, can you modify the firsts that are delinquent ahead of the -- of your own home equity loans?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "We certainly have discretion in terms of what you modify. I mean, there's not -- there aren't specific requirements for specific borrowers. We may -- and there's a lot of detail in our 10-K in terms of the specifics on the settlement. And I would -- rather than go through that in detail right now, I'd just ask you to take a peek at that. We provide a lot of detail about how we see the settlement and how it would affect us.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you, everybody. And thanks for joining our call. We appreciate your interest and also the ones who asked the questions. Thank you much, and we will see you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will review second quarter results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website.", "I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplements. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on wellsfargo.com.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before I discuss our results this quarter, I want to take a moment to recognize that 160 years ago today, on July 13 in 1852, Wells Fargo first opened its doors for business right here in San Francisco. So it's our birthday today. It's been quite a remarkable ride for the stagecoach for the last 160 years. And during that period of time, we've been through many economic cycles.", "While the current economic recovery remains uneven, our strong performance in the second quarter reflects the strength of our franchise, the benefit of our diversified business model and the advantage of an outstanding team working together to serve our customers. Our focus on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs resulted in continued strong deposit growth, growth in consumer and commercial loans and record cross-sell.", "Let me quickly review some of the highlights of the quarter. We generated record net income, up 17% from a year ago, and EPS was also up 17%. Pretax pre-provision profits increased 12%, and revenue grew 4% from a year ago. We had positive operating leverage and our expense efficiency ratio improved by 300 basis points from a year ago. Retail banking cross-sell reached a new record of 6 products per household for the entire community bank consumer base. Credit quality continued to improve with our charge-off ratio declining to 1.15%, the lowest level since 2007 and down 37 basis points from a year ago. Our profitability ratios reflect these strong results with our ROA growing to 1.41%, up 14 basis points from a year ago, the highest it's been in 4 years. Our return on equity increased to 12.86%, up 94 basis points from a year ago.  We purchased 53 million shares of common stock during the second quarter while we continued to grow capital.", "Our performance reflects growth throughout our businesses. Our mortgage business generated record applications in the second quarter of $208 billion, up over 90% from a year ago and up 11% from last quarter. Obviously, the low-rate environment is driving strong refi application volume. But purchase volume was up over $19 billion or 43% from the first quarter, indicating increased strength in the overall housing market where we've seen increases in sales and pricing in markets throughout the country, even in some of the hardest hit areas during the downturn.", "We remain focused on our commitment to helping homeowners stay in their homes with over 770,000 active trial or completed mortgage modifications since the beginning of 2009. We've also helped nearly 6.2 million customers secure new low-rate loans for home purchases or refinancing since the beginning of 2009.", "The strength of our mortgage business is just one example of how we've been able to generate new customer relationships and better serve our existing customers. We grew commercial loans through portfolio acquisitions and organically, increased credit card penetration of the retail banking households to 31%, grew retail brokerage managed account assets by 7% from a year ago and small business checking accounts were up nearly 4% from a year ago.", "This is just the beginning of the many opportunities we have to capitalize on the strength of our franchise and achieve the financial goals we shared with you at Investor Day.", "Tim Sloan, our CFO, will now provide more details on our financial results. Tim?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the presentation included in the first half of our quarterly supplement that starts on Page 2, and then John and I will take your questions.", "As John highlighted, we had a very strong quarter, with record earnings of $4.6 billion, up 9% from the first quarter and 17% from a year ago. Earnings per share were a record $0.82, also up 9% from last quarter and 17% from a year ago. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth.", "Our ability to consistently grow earnings per share over the past 2.5 years when the economy has faced many challenges reflects the benefit of our diversified business model.", "I'm going to start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our results this quarter, beginning on Page 4, and I'll add more detail later in my remarks.", "We grew both our total and our core loan portfolios. The loan growth was broad-based and benefited from acquisitions and organic growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Our securities portfolio declined $3.4 billion as new investments were more than offset by called lower-yield securities and runoff. We remain cautious in how we invest in this interest rate and credit environment.", "Turning to the income statement. Revenue declined $347 million from the first quarter as growth in net interest income and fee growth across many of our businesses was offset by declines in trading, driven by lower deferred compensation plan investment income and lower gains on equity investments. Our expense efficiency ratio improved to 58.2% as expenses declined $596 million from the first quarter, consistent with our expectations. Expenses related to the settlement with the Department of Justice, which we announced yesterday, have been fully accrued for as of the end of the second quarter.", "Let me now cover our results in a little bit more detail. As shown on Page 6, period-end loans were up $8.7 billion from the first quarter with growth across a number of commercial and consumer portfolios. The liquidating portfolio declined by $5.1 billion and our core loan portfolio grew by $13.8 billion. Commercial loans increased $8.3 billion, including $6.9 billion of loans acquired in the purchase of BNP Paribas' North American energy lending business and the purchase of WestLB subscription finance portfolio. Our strong balance sheet has enabled us to take advantage of these opportunities in this economic environment.", "Our portfolio of purchases are in businesses we understand and include both new customers and customers we already serve, providing us the opportunity to deepen these relationships.", "Consumer loans increased $375 million from the first quarter as growth in first mortgages, auto and credit card was partially offset by declines in junior lien mortgages. Average loan balances were down $359 million from the first quarter, which didn't benefit from the late quarter close of the WestLB portfolio. However, many commercial and consumer loan portfolios increased average balances on a link quarter basis.", "We had strong core deposit growth with average core deposits up $10.1 billion from the first quarter, up $73.2 billion or 9% from a year ago. Core deposits were 115% of average loans. Average core checking and savings deposits were up 12% from a year ago and were 93% of average core deposits. We have successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit costs for 7 consecutive quarters. Deposit costs in the second quarter were 19 basis points, down 1 basis point from the first quarter and down 9 basis points from a year ago.", "Tax equivalent net interest income increased $155 million from the first quarter, driven by growth in earning assets, up $16 billion, while our net interest margin was unchanged at 3.91%. The NIM included a 7 basis point benefit from higher variable items, including PCI loan resolutions in the second quarter. These variable sources of income can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, and we would expect continued pressure on our NIM as the balance sheet reprices in the current low-rate environment. But as we've said and stated many times in the past, we remain focused on growing net interest income.", "Noninterest income declined $496 million from the first quarter, down 5%. The decline was partially due to $377 million of lower trading gains on $218 million of lower deferred compensation plan investment results, which is offset in employee benefit expense. Equity gains were also lower this quarter, down $122 million. However, we continue to benefit from our diverse businesses with growth in deposit service charges, trust and investment fees, card fees, processing fees, insurance and mortgage banking.", "Mortgage banking revenue increased $23 million from the first quarter with continued strong originations and margins. Results included a $669 million provision for mortgage repurchase losses, which was $239 million higher than the first quarter, and I'll discuss this more later. Mortgage originations were $131 billion in the second quarter, up $2 billion from the strong first quarter volumes and were more than double what they were a year ago. 16% of our origination volume this quarter was from HARP, similar to last quarter. The unclosed mortgage pipeline at quarter end was a very strong $102 billion, up 29% from the first quarter, and the second highest pipeline in our history.", "Turning to expenses. Noninterest expenses were down $596 million from the first quarter, driven by lower personnel expenses. Commission and incentive compensation expense decreased $63 million as declines in seasonally high first quarter expenses were partially offset by higher revenue-driven compensation. Employee benefit expense was down $559 million from seasonally high first quarter and reflects lower deferred compensation expense. Second quarter expenses also included $524 million of operating losses, $47 million higher than the first quarter. Operating losses this quarter included an accrual for the settlement with the Department of Justice.", "We first highlighted our expense reduction program during our earnings call a year ago. One year later, we've made solid progress at reducing expenses, and we remain committed to improving our efficiency. However, a lot has changed over the past 12 months, particularly in terms of revenue opportunities.", "As shown on Slide 11, we achieved positive operating leverage with revenue growing $903 million while noninterest expense declined $78 million over the past year. As we\u2019ve said all along, we will not pass up revenue opportunities in order to meet a specific expense target number. Mortgage volumes have been much stronger than anyone expected a year ago or even 3 months ago for that matter with originations more than double what they were a year ago and our mortgage pipeline, which should lead to future revenue and expense growth, has also doubled. So while we have reduced total FTEs for Wells Fargo by 1% over the past year, we have increased FTEs in consumer real estate by 19% to capture the revenue opportunities from strong mortgage volumes. In fact, we added over 2,000 FTEs in mortgage in the second quarter.", "It is also important to note that revenue and expenses reflect the success we've had in completing several business and loan portfolio acquisitions over the past year, and we've continued to invest in our growing businesses. Also, litigation accruals have been high and our mortgage servicing costs have been elevated due to the mortgage servicing settlement and foreclosure consent orders.", "As shown on Page 12, even with all of this business and expense growth, we have achieved efficiency improvements with our efficiency ratio in the second quarter improving to 58.2%, the lowest level in 9 quarters. This improvement in our efficiency ratio demonstrates the success we've had at expense reduction even as we've grown revenue.", "Let me mention just a few examples. We've reduced FTEs in high-cost geographies by 10% since the beginning of 2011. We've reduced occupancy expense by 7%, including real estate reductions of 3 million square feet. And we have reduced third-party spend, reflecting renegotiated contracts and changes in demand. As we highlighted in Investor Day, we've established an efficiency ratio target of 55% to 59%, and we were in that range this quarter. We currently expect to be within our target range for the rest of 2012. We believe that focusing on our efficiency ratio is the best way to demonstrate expense management as we continue to focus on revenue opportunities for both this year and in the future.", "Due to our strong revenue opportunities, particularly in mortgage, we now expect our fourth quarter expenses to be higher than our previous target of $11.25 billion. However, current expenses are still too high and we expect them to trend down over the remainder of the year from second quarter levels.", "Let me now briefly highlight on our segment results starting on Page 13. Community Banking earned $2.5 billion in the second quarter, up 8% from the first quarter. Retail banking reached a record cross-sell of 6 products per household, up from 5.82 a year ago. Cross-sell growth occurred throughout our franchise with the West increasing to 6.37 and the East increasing to 5.52, up 27 basis points from a year ago. The momentum in the East is also demonstrated by core product sales growing by 5% from a year ago. Credit card penetration in our retail banking households continue to increase to 31%, up from 27% a year ago. We generated a record -- we generated record consumer auto originations in the second quarter of $6.6 billion, up 6% from the first quarter and up 18% from a year ago.", "Wholesale Banking earned $1.9 billion in the second quarter, with record revenue of $6.1 billion, which was broad-based across our diversified commercial businesses. Revenue also benefited from increased PCI loan resolution income. Wholesale Banking had solid loan growth, up 1% from the first quarter and 11% from a year ago. The growth was broad-based, reflecting new and existing customer growth and our ability to capitalize on acquisition opportunities in this environment. During the second quarter, $3.7 billion of loans that were acquired in the purchase of BNP Paribas' North American energy lending business with nearly $9.4 billion in loan commitments. We also completed the acquisition of $3.2 billion of subscription finance loans from WestLB with nearly $6 billion of commitments. We've also had strong organic growth with 8 consecutive quarters of average loan growth in our Commercial Banking portfolio from new originations and increased line utilization from our middle market customers.", "Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $343 million, up 16% from the first quarter. Revenue declined $91 million from the first quarter, excluding $122 million of lower deferred compensation plan investment results. Revenue increased 1%, driven by higher retail brokerage asset-based fees.  Cross-sell continued to increase with our focus on meeting all of our customers' financial needs growing to 10.22, up from 9.94 a year ago.", "Credit quality continued to improve this quarter as shown on Page 16 with better performance across portfolios and credit metrics. Net charge-offs were down $195 million from the first quarter and were 1.15% of average loans, down 10 basis points from the last quarter. From the peak in the fourth quarter of 2009, charge-offs are down $3.2 billion or 59%. Provision expense was $1.8 billion, including a $400 million reserve release. Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases in 2012.", "Nonperforming assets were down $1.8 billion from the first quarter, down 11% from a year ago. The linked quarter decline reflects a $1.4 billion reduction in NPLs and a $310 million decline in foreclosed assets. NPAs were 3.21% of total loans in the second quarter, the lowest level since 2009. Loans 90 days or more past due were down $276 million or 17% from the first quarter with declines in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Early-stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also improved from the first quarter and were also significantly better than a year ago.", "We service $1.9 trillion of residential mortgages. This is a great business because of the new customer growth and cross-sell opportunities it provides, and our servicing portfolio positions us well to benefit from refinance waves like the one we're experiencing now since existing customers usually give us the first chance when they refinance.", "As we've been highlighting for several quarters, the delinquency and foreclosure rate on our servicing portfolio was over 400 basis points lower than the industry average, excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recently publicly available data demonstrating the quality of our portfolio. Our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 7.14% in the first quarter, seasonally higher than -- excuse me, in the second quarter, seasonally higher than the first quarter, but down from 7.44% a year ago and a peak of 8.96% in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "As I mentioned earlier, we added $669 million to our repurchase reserve this quarter, up $239 million from the first quarter. While outstanding repurchase demands were down this quarter, we added to our repurchase reserve primarily due to an increase in expected demands from the GSEs regarding 2006 to 2008 vintages. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, we continue to see behavioral changes from the agencies as they seem to be conforming their practices and this addition to the reserve was a result of our ongoing dialogue with them, including some communication very late in the quarter. We believe the additional reserve we added this quarter is appropriate to cover losses associated with these higher expected demands.", "As shown on Page 20, our capital position continued to grow with our Tier 1 common equity ratio increasing to 10.0%, up 10 basis points from the last quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under the latest Basel III proposals included in notices of proposed rule-making issued by the regulators in June were 7.78% for the second quarter. The proposed rules were largely consistent with our expectations, but changes in a few areas reduced our estimated ratio by approximately 30 basis points this quarter. Even after factoring in these changes, we are still in a strong capital position as reflected in our estimated ratio. And we expect to achieve Basel minimums well in advance of any published guidelines.", "We purchased 53 million shares in the second quarter and entered into a forward repurchase transaction for an estimated 11 million shares that is expected to settle in the third quarter. We redeemed $1.8 billion of trust preferred securities with an average coupon of 6.31% in the quarter. We\u2019ve redeemed a total of $11.9 billion of TruPS since the beginning of 2011.", "In summary, our strong results again this quarter continued to demonstrate the benefit of our diversified business model. By following our consistent vision, we once again achieved record earnings, higher pretax pre-provision profit, positive operating leverage with reduced expenses and improved credit quality. Our return on assets was 1.41%, the highest in 16 quarters and within our target range of 1.3% to 1.6% that we provided on Investor Day. Our ROE grew to 12.86%, also within our target range of 12% to 15%. And while we had great results this quarter, we have plenty of opportunity ahead for future growth, including a strong mortgage pipeline, recently completed acquisitions, improving cross-sell, increasing market share and improving efficiency all while remaining very focused on risk.", "I will now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My first question is I guess I'm just trying to figure out the movement in terms of core loan yield trends. So if I take out the $113 million of -- it seemed like outsized resolution that accreted back to your margin on the PCI book, it still seems as if your core loan yield would only be down less than 5%. So could you give us a sense of: A, was there some enhancement from the BNP transaction in your commercial loan yield this quarter? Or if not, what are you doing differently to keep your pricing relatively resilient?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, that's a fair question and I think your estimate of the impact of the special items is correct. Neither the acquisitions, either the BNP acquisition or WestLB, really impacted the core loan yields. They were very similar to similar loans that we had in similar portfolios we already had on the sheet. And so there's really nothing in particular that's going on from a loan yield standpoint. It's competitive out there. We continue to compete as best we can. We tend not to be -- to over compete on price. We focus on competing on relationship and growing cross-sell. But there's nothing special there at all.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And on the bond portfolio, you mentioned in the presentation that some lower-yielding securities were called. What was sort of the impact of that in terms of -- the AFS yields were up quarter-over-quarter. Was that primarily due to that, the lower-yielding bond getting called? And also, if you could give us a sense in terms of what you were reinvesting in from a duration and yield perspective this quarter.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, that was a driver for the increase in the yield. And really what happened is we had some very high-quality short-term government or government agency securities that were called that we had invested in, in the end of the third, early fourth quarter of last year when we had all that excess liquidity that occurred. And what we did is we looked across the spectrum and saw the best -- some of the best risk return being in very high-quality municipal securities and so that was the exchange.", "Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And just one more on capital, thank you so much for giving us an updated Basel III number. I was wondering as you looked through the how to interpret the risk weighting by LTV on the resi portfolio, did you give yourselves credit for the purchase accounting marks on the Wachovia book?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, we did, we did. And again, I think that the important thing to think about when you -- as we look through the NPRs is that while it did have about a 30 basis point impact, we don't -- and there's a lot of give-and-takes that we're going to have with the regulators and the whole industry will have with the regulators on the various items, in terms of our ability to meet any sort of capital requirements on any reasonable set of time, we're going to meet them well in advance. So we've got a lot of discussion to have with the regulators, but we're fine from a capital standpoint.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes, let me just emphasize that. We're in that unique position of not having to do anything uneconomic or different to somehow hoard capital or to meet something. We are -- we have such strong capital, such strong cash flows and earnings here. It puts us in a position where we can grow organically, do strategic and value-adding portfolio acquisitions or whatever. So it really puts us in a great position. Capital simply is a not an issue here. Nothing I'd worry about.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "A couple of nitty-gritty questions for Tim. Tim, on the share count, the average diluted shares were up but despite the buyback and even though the end of period is down, is that just timing of when the buybacks were done or something else there?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "John, it's a function of timing. It's a good question. It's a function of the timing and also the fact that we tend to have more share issuance in the first part of the year. If you look over last year, you saw something relatively similar in that the share count drifted down a little bit toward the end of the year. But it's nothing special other than just timing.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the variable source items contributing to NIM this quarter and assuming 7 basis points, besides loan resolutions, can you just give us a feel for what other types of variable sources are affecting the NIM?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "It was mostly loan resolutions, John, and that's why we called it out. The NIM's been flat quarter-over-quarter and we wanted to make sure that you all appreciated that 7 basis points was something that was relatively special.", "John G. Stumpf", "And John, as we have mentioned in the past and we'll say it again, NIM will be under pressure as -- in this low-rate environment. And while we don't manage to it, we surely talk about it. But what's important here is we're able to grow net interest income and that's really the driver.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay, and do you see more opportunity to buy loan books from other banks? What is the market like for that kind of opportunity?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I think the market continues to provide opportunities for firms that have the liquidity and the capital to be able to take advantage of it. Whether or not we'll be successful, I certainly can't promise you because we turn down more than we pursue. But we're just very, very pleased over the past year to have been in position to make the acquisitions that we've done.  To date, they've all worked out well and we look forward to looking at more acquisitions in the future.", "John G. Stumpf", "John, we -- like I said lots and we kick a lot of tires. We say no to more stuff than we say yes to. But we don't do another deal that's -- we'll do other things, but we're still looking at a lot of things.", "John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And last thing for me, understanding that it's not a big deal as it's only one quarter of capital build for you, but what in the Basel III NPRs drove that 30 basis point revision to your pro forma outlook, Tim?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, there were a couple of things in the numerator, John. First, in terms of how the OCI related to our pension would be handled. And then second was the MSR floor. And then on the denominator side, it was primarily an RWA adjustment for the removal of the credit rating for AFS securities. But again, it wasn't significant.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Tim, I got a couple quick questions, one I'm not sure I heard you correctly. But the sequential quarter build in the loan repurchase reserves, roughly $240 million above first quarter levels, would you consider it more of a onetime true of from what you're seeing from the GSEs recently?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I wouldn't say it's a onetime true up, Chris. I'd love to be able to tell you that, that's the case. It may be; it may not be in terms of what we see in the future. I think we're just continuing to be -- to want to make sure that we've got that reserve absolutely accrued for appropriately. And we saw the agencies continuing to adjust their requests. Again, these are not specific demands. This is in advance of demands, but it's at our best expectations that what the demands are going to look like in the future.", "John G. Stumpf", "But Chris, let me say this. Just because there's demands, I mean we're going to push back. We have a team and we look through this stuff. And this is -- we have -- and we've been successful in the past in that, but we just wanted to give you a heads-up about what's -- what we expect in the future. But there's a whole team here that takes this very seriously.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, there's a lot of give-and-take in this relationship and you can see that we're good at making progress in terms of those discussions because of the fact that demands were actually down. When we get something, we work through it. Sometimes we agree; sometimes we don't. But it's a pretty healthy conversation.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I appreciate that. The TruPS were paid off late in the quarter, if I did my math right. That saves you maybe $115 million or so a year. What about the sub-debt? What was the yield on the sub-debt, the $2.2 billion that saves you in interest expense going forward?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "You know what, Chris, I'd -- to be honest with you, I don't have it handy. We'll get back to you on that. But it was lower than -- much lower than the TruPS. I want to say 200, 300 basis points, but we'll get back to you on that.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But again, they both happened late in the quarter, so that's a bit of an offset going forward in terms of lower expense.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Correct. I mean I think just overall, the TruPS repurchase and the fact that we did it as early as we did has been a real benefit for us and will continue to be a benefit.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And can I have one final question? The securities yields were actually up 13 basis points sequentially. Are you taking more duration risk in the current environment to get that type of yields increased sequentially?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, we're not. We're not taking any significant duration risk or any significant credit risk. This is still a very high-quality portfolio and the duration is relatively short.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Then how does the yield go up sequentially with the rates going down?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, fair question. Similar to where Erika was coming out. And that is that it was really an exchange of some very low-yield, short-term, very high-quality government or government agency securities in exchange for some municipals and some MBS.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I want to ask you -- first question just on expenses and I think everyone understands that better revenue outlook for the better expense outlook for the fourth quarter. But can you, at this point, help us to understand how much more of an impact the Project Compass will be as we look forward into next year? There'll be seasonality obviously early next year, but just from a run rate as you expect things broader picture, do you guys -- can give us a sense of the magnitude of incremental saves that can still come out of the run rate?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, fair question. We have not begun our detailed planning for next year. Having said that, I think that we continue to see pretty significant changes that we can make as it relates to any sort of the run rate, which will be Project Compass. We also have some environmental items like higher operating losses due to litigation accruals and the like that hopefully will come out over time. So we think we can make some progress. And that's what one of the reasons why we've provided the range of 55% to 59% at Investor Day. If we thought that we were at the end and we were going to be at 58%, 59%, we wouldn't have provided that range to 55%.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes, and let me state we still have opportunity. Expenses are still too high around here given the operating environment. So we -- all hands are on deck. We've lost none of our enthusiasm or opportunity or passion to do that. And this is not a destination; this is a journey. And it will continue next quarter, the quarter after into next year. But also what's important is not only Compass expenses, but expenses in businesses that move up and down. How quickly we can take mortgage costs out when mortgage -- when the refi boom ends. And those are also critically important. But we get this in spades and that's why we've been so public about the fact that we have opportunity here.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And my second question just relates to -- 2 questions on the loan book. First of all, I was just wondering if you guys can comment on just commercial activity, your just general sense from customers out there just given the uncertainty in the environment and outlook there. And then the second question is looked like the pace of runoff was a little bigger this quarter in that part of the portfolio. Just what you generally expect from a pace of runoff going forward.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, let me take the last question first. The pace of runoff in the commercial portfolio was impacted in some of our commercial real estate loans, which drove the PCI resolution. That was a primary diver there. I wish I could tell you that was going to happen every quarter, but I can't. In terms of overall commercial loan demand, it still seems good. I wouldn't call it great. I mean I think we're in the midst of a recovery. It's a slow recovery. But what was good from our perspective was to see a more broad-based level of loan growth in our commercial portfolio in addition to the acquisitions. And we also saw, and I mentioned it in my remarks, a continued increase in line usage. It's not significant, but we bottomed in terms of line usage about a year or so ago and it's been slowly but steadily going up. But I would call it good, and it's a very competitive market.", "John G. Stumpf", "And I should also mention that we actually had -- we saw some opportunities or some performance on the consumer side, which is really healthy. We're doing very well in auto; we did very well in small business; we did very well in card this quarter. So that's very positive. Because we have -- home equity is coming down. So to show some improvement there was very encouraging.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to ask you about the pipeline and the impact that, that can have on originations. If you look at the last couple of quarters, your pipeline kind of converted into originations at about a 1.7 kind of ratio. So in other words, whatever you had in the pipeline, you originated 70% more in the next quarter. With a $102 billion pipeline, would that equate to north of -- it puts you around $170 billion in originations in the next quarter. Is that anywhere close to where you think you could see the numbers?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Marty, I hope that's the case. But when you think about the conversion, it's just as much as what's going to happen in terms of business this month and the beginning of August. We've ramped up our team members in mortgage to be able to move the pipeline through as quickly as we can. But again -- and I -- so I hope $170 billion is the right number, but it could be a little bit different.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "The third quarter typically is a good seasonal quarter for home purchase as well. So you at least have that kind of coming back in if we're seeing any strength there, which is a positive.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, that's right.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "The other thing I was going to ask is if I calculated it right, it looks like the gain on sale went from about $240 million down to around $210 million this quarter. Is it starting to stabilize or should there -- any more return to more normal, which would be just a little bit below 2%?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, our numbers -- your numbers are actually pretty close, Marty. Our number was closer to about $220 million, $225 million or so but in that zip code. And it's remaining pretty stable.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then when we go back, one more try on the mortgage repurchase activity, you said you had some discussions with agencies. We had a couple other companies that took special kind of hits in the sense of reserving for future losses given better information they were getting from the agencies, which really reflects an acceleration of future losses that they expect to see. Would you kind of couch this $669 million number in that kind of range or in that kind of aspect?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Marty, I wouldn't want to speculate on what's going to happen in the future. What we wanted to do was make sure that we were appropriately reserved for this quarter. As John said, there's going to be a lot of healthy conversation with the agencies on whatever future demands are going to provide. Again, these were based on conversations in which we expected future demands as opposed to specific demands.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and the last question is the 7 basis points impact from PCI on the margin, is that an incremental benefit or how would that compare to last quarter?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "That's the incremental benefit, Marty, and that's why we wanted to call it out.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And just to follow-up on the mortgage banking side. I can't get this out, on the HARP stuff and back in your Investor Day, you said HARP wasn't playing as big as a role as a lot of the media people were talking about. Are you seeing an increase in HARP? Are you still in that category that you're not seeing a lot of HARP loans coming through the pipeline?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, Paul, good question. What we were referring to at Investor Day was the media reports at the time that indicated that the HARP margins were outsized relative to the rest of the originations, which wasn't the case then and isn't the case now. The fundings have actually been pretty stable in terms of -- I think we, at Investor Day, we might have said 15%.", "John G. Stumpf", "16%.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Now, it's 16% now. And that's about -- it just seems pretty stable in that percentage. I mean it could go up or down a few percentage, but 16% is a pretty good number.", "John G. Stumpf", "Now, for others that might be higher as a percentage because they do less other things. The denominator is different. But for us, it's been pretty flat.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay, and then I don't know because I've been running around all day this morning with JPMorgan, but did you guys talk about -- a little bit about have you seen any decline at all? Because a lot of people have been talking about the refi index as being down. But we're hearing mixed reviews out there that if the flow or the demand is really going down out there in the month of July.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "We haven't published any of the July information. But as of just a couple of weeks ago with the pipeline that we have, things -- the business is good and we're optimistic about it.", "John G. Stumpf", "Very optimistic.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I understand the long-term: you had your whole Investor Day; and I understand the short-term mortgage: you're very optimistic. It's the medium term: if and when mortgage slows, what fills that bucket? What replaces that? Could there be kind of an oh no! quarter where mortgage slows and you haven't cut the expenses yet?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, Mike, we could always an oh no! quarter. This is a volatile business that we're in, for sure. I think that when you\u2019re looking at the history of the company, we've had a profitable mortgage business for decades. But within that profitability, we've had a lot of cycles. We understand that the mortgage business is a very cyclical business, particularly when you look at the refi cycles that we've had over the past few years. And I would just point to the fact that while I can't promise this is going to be the case, while we've printed 10 consecutive quarters of earnings growth, we've had ups and downs in the mortgage business. And I think what that reflects is the benefit of the fact that we've got a very diversified business model, all right? The mortgage business is important to us. But when you look at the percentage of mortgage revenues for last year and the year before, it goes down because we're growing the rest of the business quite nicely. So I can't tell you specifically what would take the place of the decline in mortgage revenues, which will occur. We know that's going to happen because it's unlikely that we'll continue at this pace for the medium term as you point out. But we do believe that because we saw loan growth in many of our portfolios, we saw fee growth in many of the businesses that we can continue to grow even in the medium term.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes, and Mike, I've -- and Tim's absolutely right in that. But even within the mortgage business, think about it. We are already seeing more purchase volume activity and the business is balanced pretty nicely between the servicing side and the origination side. So when originations tend to ebb, the servicing tends to do better. So I mean -- so there's a whole bunch of stuff. And there's -- we always say there's lots of different horses pulling this coach and one pulls harder when the other one doesn't pull as hard. So that's the beauty of this balanced business model.  But, Mike, we will not stretch for something. If -- I mean, that we -- it's just not in our culture to do that. So if we happen to have something that goes down one quarter, that's life.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And what if -- if you're not pulling as much in the coach, what about you eliminating a couple of horses to stretch the analogy?", "John G. Stumpf", "We're trimming manes all the time.", "Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "But you're -- within range of your efficiency target, how quickly would you be able to take out the mortgage expenses if you see mortgage slowing? Is that one quarter, is it 5 quarters?", "John G. Stumpf", "That's a very fair question. And we\u2019ve become, I think, really, really good at how to deal with -- how to make what would traditionally been more permanent expenses variable in that business. So we do -- we have lots of skill in that area. But it can\u2019t happen in one week, I mean, but we're always looking for improvements in how to become much more variable in expenses that used to be more fixed.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Greg with UBS.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "One on the mortgage production outlook, at least as best as you can tell at this point, when you think about the sources in a HARP 2.0, you had mentioned 15% to 16% of production. Then there's also the other refi volume. As you look at those opportunities going forward, is there a percent of eligible refinance that you feel like you've worked through and there's a percent remaining that we'll see over the next couple of quarters?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "We talk about that, right, all the time. We talk to our mortgage folks about that all the time. But it's -- that's a really, really hard number to come up with, with any specificity. So I wouldn't want to throw out something and then you guys take our market share of that and then assume that we're going to get that over the next few quarters. I hope we do, but I'm not confident enough on that.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Is there a sense there with this refi opportunity between HARP 2.0 and the sensitivity around rate changes where there could be additional refinancing that the cycle has at least a couple of quarters\u2019 legs left in it and we should see production levels stay relatively strong?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I hope that's the case. And given that we start this quarter with a pretty strong pipeline, we think that will be the case for the near term. I do think that one of the differences about this refinancing cycle, which I think is where you're going and it's right on point is that because of some of these other programs, it's going to create a little bit more of a foundation in terms of demand for a longer period of time.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on share repurchases with the 53 million done and 11 million forward, is there any view that you can provide in terms of additional share repurchase activity for the rest of this year?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, fair question. I want to point out that we were not able to purchase shares in the first quarter of this year just like we weren't able in the first quarter of last year just because of the timing of the CCAR process. So when you look at the share repurchase that we did in the second quarter, I wouldn't necessarily multiply that by 2 to get what we're going to do in the third and the fourth quarter. But what -- we are going to continue to repurchase shares. We've got the ability to do it. We continue to believe our shares are undervalued. And we're going to continue to be in the market.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Then last question, was there any debt valuation adjustment that was significant in the quarter?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just really a follow -- one follow-up question on the, Tim, your comment concerning the securities yields. You mentioned that the reason for the security yield increase was on the agent -- was because of the prepayment on agency securities. But it was in the residence -- it was in the non-agency securities on the mortgage-backed that we saw the linked quarter increase in the yield and I was wondering if -- what might be going on there.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, it's a function of -- you're talking about the line item that says securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions, is that the one?", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "No, under mortgage-backed securities, you've got the line item federal agencies and then you've got residential and commercial, which I'm assuming is non-agency MBS and that's the line item where you saw the yield increase.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, I would just describe that as just more of a mix in terms of individual securities. There's nothing special that's going on there.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "But over time that 6.97% yield should -- we should expect that to decline if you're taking less risk; is that fair?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Oh, I think, Fred, as we talked about, I think where we have the biggest impact in terms of yields is in our AFS book and it's under pressure, and that's one of the drivers of our concern about the NIM.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Right. I was just -- I think we had a linked quarter increase of 17 basis points there, but -- so that's just more of a one quarter blip we should think of rather than a trend?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I wish I could tell you that's going to continue, but I don't think that's going to be the case.", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "One other question on the mortgage business. In the DOJ announcement yesterday, it said that you would discontinue funding mortgages at originated price and sold by independent mortgage brokers through your wholesale channel. I was wondering how much of the wholesale channel that is that you're shutting that down and kind of any reasons behind that.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, in terms of the percentage, it was about 5% of our originations. So that the...", "Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And you're shutting down that entire 5%.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "That's correct. We're going to take applications through today and then there's a time period by which we need to get that information they need to close by. But that's correct; we're exiting that portion of the business.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Following up actually on the mortgage business. So you are shutting the wholesale channel, like you said about 5%. At the Investor Day, you talked a little bit about having picked up all the market share in correspondent, but wondering whether you were going to kind of keep it there. Can you talk a little bit about what your thoughts are; if they've changed any? And also, whether the industry as a whole has been quick or slow to add capacity and whether you think that is good for kind of pricing going forward?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I think in terms of our view on the correspondent business, it really hasn't changed. We think it's a good business. As we've had -- as we mentioned on Investor Day, I think Mike Heid did a really good job of kind walking through the opportunities that we've had over the past year, in particular in terms of adding correspondents and we've been very careful to make sure that we add the right correspondents. We have long, strong relationships with a number of correspondents and again we like the business. In terms of adding staff to be able to process the volume we've had, I mean these have been unprecedented times in terms of how quickly volume has changed. And we've been adding folks to be able to underwrite and process these as quickly as we can and we'll continue to do that. But like -- at the same time, when volume starts to decline, we need to be ready to reduce, too. But there's nothing different going on here. You just need to make sure that you've got sustained volume before you add a lot of people.", "John G. Stumpf", "And just maybe -- just so we're all on the same wavelength here. The wholesale that we're turning down is different from correspondent. Correspondent is where you know the actual date when they close on. This is where the loan is priced and originated, but we close it and that's the part -- the wholesale piece that, that we couldn't be sure of what price is.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So risk management, it's a risk management decision.", "John G. Stumpf", "Exactly. It's many different things so -- and...", "Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Right, okay. But it just feels like the industry has been a little slower to add costs and capacity this cycle, would you agree with that or...", "John G. Stumpf", "No, I wouldn't say that at all. I think it's a...", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So just 2 quick questions, just to sort of help us with sort of the forecasting outlook a little bit. When I'm thinking about operating costs and I'm looking at that $524 million of operating losses and I understand why it was high in each of the last 2 quarters, but is there any particular reason that, that should stay at this level, or is it reasonable to expect that number to come down fairly significantly in subsequent quarters?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I think one way to think about it, Ed, is if you look back on how that's gone up and down over the last year, for example, you've seen quarters where it's been $200 million, $300 million lower. And we're hoping, right, that those operating losses will go down as we continue to put any sort of, particularly legal -- open legal issue behind us. So I hope that's the case.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "But the vast, vast majority of that number is litigation accrual, correct?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "A good portion of it is, but we're generally not specific in terms of exactly how much of it is related to litigation accruals.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, secondarily, when I'm thinking about net interest margin and you talked about the extra 7 basis points primarily from the extra PCI loan resolution income, it seems like you're sort of alluding to the idea that you could get additional margin pressure off of sort of a 3 84 starting point as opposed to a 3 91 starting point. First question, I guess is, is that the right way to think about it? And second question is as you look at the PCI portfolio, should we think it's reasonably likely to expect future quarters where we\u2019ll see some meaningful resolution income?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, in answer to your last question, we're hopeful that we get meaningful resolution income every quarter. But -- and there's still more to get, right? We're not done with the PCI loan portfolio. Having said that, you hit the nail on the head. That's why we called out the 7 basis points, right, that without that, we would have been in the mid-3 80s. And we know where yields are today on securities, in particular. But again, I think you got to put it in the context of the fact that the majority of our earning assets, 70%, 75% plus, our loans and the yields are within a reasonable range. While we're having the biggest -- we have the biggest impact is on our securities portfolio. But you're right. I think thinking about this in kind of a mid 3 80 number and having some downside from there is a fair way to look at it.", "Operator", "At this time there are no further questions.", "John G. Stumpf", "Okay, well, thank you very much for joining us for our second quarter call, and we'll talk to you 90 days from now. Thank you very much.

Mutascio \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will review third quarter results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.", "Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings; including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Our results in the third quarter demonstrated the underlying strength of our diversified business model and our ability to earn more of our customers\u2019 business, driving outstanding performance throughout our franchise.", "Let me quickly review some of the highlights of the quarter. We achieved record net income up 22% from a year ago and EPS was also up 22%. Revenue grew 8% and pre-tax pre-provision profit increased 14% from a year ago. Our core loan portfolio grew 6% and core deposits were also up 6% from a year ago.", "We had positive operating leverage and our efficiency ratio improved by 240 basis points from year ago. We had continued strong underlying credit performance. Our profitability ratios reflected these strong results with a return on assets growing to 1.45%, up 19 basis points from year-ago, the highest it\u2019s been in five years. Our return on equity increased to 13.38%, up 152 basis points from a year-ago.", "Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III reached 8.02% as we continue to have strong capital growth while remaining focus on returning more capital to our shareholders. This strong performance during a period of slow and uneven economic growth was driven by momentum across Wells Fargo\u2019s diversified businesses.", "We have a broad set of products that enables us to meet all of our customers\u2019 financial needs, which is reflected by our record retail banking cross-sell this quarter of 6.04 products per household. In the current low rate environment, our mortgage business continued to benefit from the strong refi and purchase volume. And credit quality reflected an improving housing market.", "Our credit card business is successfully generating new account growth, up 46% from a year-ago, and we are focused on increasing customer card usage, which is generating strong balance and fee growth. We\u2019ve grown managed account assets in our retail brokerage business over 25% in the past 12 months driven by strong net flows and market performance.", "Our wholesale banking business continues to meet the financial needs of our commercial customers generating nine consecutive quarters of loan growth from our middle market customers. We are also meeting the lending needs of our small business customers with $11.4 billion of new loan commitments so far this year, up approximately 30% from a year ago. These are just a few examples of the momentum we have throughout our businesses as we remain focused on better serving our customers, while we continue to be diligent in managing our costs and risks.", "Our ability to meet a broadly diversified set of customer needs throughout a variety of economic cycles is a clear Wells Fargo advantage, and contributed to another strong quarter for our company.", "Tim Sloan, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our financial results. Tim?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the presentation included in the first half of our quarterly supplement starting on Page 2, and then John and I will take your questions.", "As John highlighted, we had a very strong quarter, with record earnings of $4.9 billion, up 7% from the second quarter. Earnings per share were a record $0.88, up 7% from last quarter, our 11th consecutive quarter of EPS growth and the 6th consecutive quarter of record EPS.", "Our ability to consistently generate earnings growth reflects the benefit of our diversified business model. We are balanced between fee and spread income, and our sources of fee generation are also very diversified.", "As John highlighted, we had many businesses serving our commercial and consumer customers that had strong growth this quarter, and I\u2019ll provide more examples throughout my comments today.", "I\u2019m going to highlight some of the key drivers of our results this quarter starting on Page 4, and then I\u2019ll discuss them in more detail later in my remarks.", "We had strong balance sheet growth in the quarter. We grew both our total and core loan portfolios with growth in commercial and consumer portfolios. We once again had strong deposit growth with balances up $23 billion.", "Turning to credit, we continue to have strong underlying credit performance this quarter. However, our reported results were affected by regulatory guidance issued to the industry by the OCC. The guidance covers consumer loans that are current or less than 60 days delinquent, where the borrower has declared bankruptcy.", "The implementation of this guidance resulted in a $1.4 billion reclassification of performing consumer loans to non-accrual and a $567 million in net charge-offs, which was fully covered by our loan loss reserves. Absent this change, credit performance continued to improve, which I\u2019ll also highlight later on the call.", "Turning to the income statement, net interest income was down as our net interest margin declined as expected from the second quarter. We had strong non-interest income growth across a number of our businesses this quarter, and we remain focused on reducing expenses, and we generated positive operating leverage.", "Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page six, period-end loans were up $7.4 billion in the second quarter, with growth across a number of commercial and consumer portfolios. The liquidating portfolio declined by $4.5 billion, and our core loan portfolio grew by $11.9 billion. We\u2019ve now grown our core portfolio for eight consecutive quarters.", "Commercial loans declined $1.5 billion as growth in C&I and real estate construction loans was offset by declines in our real estate mortgage loans, leases, and foreign portfolios. Consumer loans increased by $8.9 billion, with growth in first mortgage, auto, credit card, and private student lending.", "The growth in our first mortgage portfolio was due to our decision to retain $9.8 billion of new conforming fixed rate production, with most of this coming later in the quarter. While retaining these mortgage loans on our balance sheet reduced mortgage revenue this quarter, we expect to generate spread income in future quarters for mortgage loans with higher yields than mortgage-backed securities we could have purchased in the market. We are in a unique position to have a large enough mortgage business and strong capital to be able to make these choices that should benefit long-term results.", "We currently expect to retain additional conforming mortgages in the fourth quarter. Average loan balances increased $8.5 billion from the second quarter, benefiting from the strong consumer loan growth in the late second quarter close of the WestLB portfolio.", "Deposit growth remained strong this quarter with average deposits up $22.5 billion from the second quarter and up $63.9 billion, or 7% from a year ago. Average core checking and savings deposits were up 9% from a year ago and were 94% of average core deposits.", "We continue to benefit from lower deposit costs with average deposit costs of 18 basis points in the third quarter, down one basis point from the second quarter and down seven basis points from a year ago. We\u2019ve successfully grown deposits, while reducing our deposit costs for eight consecutive quarters.", "Tax equivalent net interest income declined $393 million from the second quarter. average earning assets grew $26.3 billion linked-quarter with growth in short-term investments and mortgages held for sale. as we expected, the NIM was under pressure this quarter.", "The 25 basis point decline in the net interest margin was driven by three primary factors. First, variable income declined from strong second quarter levels, which accounted for 10 basis points of the linked-quarter decline in the net interest margin. second, approximately eight basis points of the margin pressure was driven by continued balance sheet repricing, as higher yielding earning assets ran off, and we were cautious in our reinvestment activity focusing on shorter duration securities.", "Specifically, six basis points of the decline was from our available-for-sale portfolio and two basis points of the decline was from the loan portfolio. Third, the remaining seven basis points was driven by strong deposit growth we had in the quarter and invested in short-term investments in Fed funds sold.", "As we\u2019ve highlighted for the past year or so, we expect continued pressure on the net interest margin, given the slow rate environment. however, we don\u2019t believe, the net interest margin decline we had this quarter is representative of what we\u2019ll see in the future.", "Noninterest income increased $299 million from the second quarter, up 3%. growth was broad-based and included a 6% increase in deposit service charges, which was driven by product and pricing changes that we have now rolled out throughout our geographies. Trust and investment fees grew $56 million, or 2% from the second quarter, reflecting strong asset-based fees in retail, brokerage, and asset management, as well as higher retail brokerage transaction volume.", "Credit card fees increased 6% from the second quarter, driven by new account growth and higher volumes, including a 5% increase in credit card transactions. Trading gains were up $266 million with $153 million of higher deferred compensation plan investment income, which was offset in employee benefit expense and stronger customer accommodation trading results.", "Mortgage banking revenue declined $86 million from the second quarter, driven by lower servicing income. The decline in servicing income was primarily due to a $350 million reduction in our MSR valuation for updating servicing and foreclosure costs. the ratio of MSRs to related loan service for others was ahead a historical low 63 basis points.", "Mortgage gain on sale revenue was up $396 million from the second quarter, despite approximately $200 million in forgone revenue from retaining conforming mortgage loans, which I mentioned earlier.", "Third quarter results included a $462 million provision for mortgage repurchase losses, which was $207 million lower than the second quarter. Mortgage originations were $139 billion in the third quarter, up $8 billion from the second quarter and up $50 billion from a year-ago. 14% of our origination volume this quarter was from HARP. The unclosed mortgage pipeline at quarter end was $97 billion, down from last quarter, but still very strong and volume during the first few weeks of October has accelerated as rates reached new lows.", "Turning to expenses, we continue to make progress in reducing costs. Non-interest expenses were down $285 million from the second quarter. This decline includes lower personnel expenses from lower severance costs. Operating losses were down $243 million on lower litigation accruals. Our litigation reserves consider all litigation matters we are aware off including the recently announced FHA lawsuit.", "Insurance expenses declined $132 million due to seasonally lower insurance commissions. Our efficiency ratio continued to improve down to 57.1%, the lowest level in 10 quarters, and within our target range of 55% to 59%. We expect to be within this range in the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made, we remain focused on managing the expenses even as we continue to benefit from strong revenue opportunities throughout our businesses.", "Turning to our segment results starting on page 11; community banking earned $2.7 billion in the third quarter, up 8% from the second quarter. Retail banking achieved a record cross-sell of 6.0 products per household, up from 5.9 a year-ago. Cross-sell in the West grew to 6.4 and reached 5.56 in the East. We continue to have strong partner referrals including such products as insurance, mortgage, and student lending, which were up more than 30% from a year ago. To support future growth, we consistently have invested throughout our franchise. For example, we increased platform banker FTEs in East by more than 500, or 5% from the second quarter.", "Wholesale Banking earned record net income of $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from the second quarter. The results this quarter reflects strong fee income, solid loan growth or expenses and improved credit quality. Credit losses in Wholesale Banking were just eight basis points this quarter, reflecting higher recoveries and improved performance.", "We had strong results across a number of our wholesale businesses. Let me give you a few examples. Within our CMBS capital markets business, we increased our market share from 8% in the second quarter to 15% in the third quarter as we securitize more of our home loans and also better met the securitization needs of our customers. Our asset management business grew assets under management by 3% from the second quarter and Wholesale Banking\u2019s cross-sell increased to 6.7, up from 6.5 at year-end 2011.", "Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $338 million, down 1% from the second quarter, reflecting lower net interest income partially offset by higher brokerage transaction and asset-based revenue, and lower net charge-offs. WBR client assets were up 4% from the second quarter, including strong growth in average core deposits up 2% and retail brokerage managed asset accounts up 7% driven by strong net flows and market performance. Our continued focus on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs is reflected in achieving a record cross-sell ratio of 10.27 products for WBR household, driven by growth in retail banking products.", "Turning to credit quality, as I highlighted at the beginning of my remarks, our reported credit metrics were impacted by the implementation of the OCC industry guidance related to bankruptcies. Page 14 highlights that our underlying credit trends adjusted for this impact continued to improve.", "Let me review our trends adjusted for this impact. Net charge-offs declined $409 million from the second quarter, and were 92 basis points of average loans.

Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we continue to expect future reserve releases.", "Another sign of improving underlying credit trends was a $4.3 billion addition to the accretable yield balance primarily from our Pick-a-Pay portfolio. $3.6 billion was due to an increase in expected cash flows that did not affect the non-accretable difference and $687 million of the increase was a re-classification from non-accretable difference to accretable yield.", "These increases reflect an improved housing market forecast and credit outlook, and will be recognized through net interest income over the expected life of these loans, which increased to approximately 13 years for our Pick-a-Pay portfolio.", "Non-performing assets were down $1.1 billion from the second quarter, and were 3.04% of total loans. Loans 90 days or more past due increased $132 million from the second quarter reflecting normal seasonality in consumer loans, but were down $437 million from a year ago. Early stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also increased from the second quarter due to seasonality, but were significantly better than a year ago.", "Page 17 is just a reminder of the quality of our mortgage servicing portfolio with over 70% of the portfolios being with the agencies. The quality of our portfolio is demonstrated by the low delinquency and foreclosure rate on our servicing portfolio, which was over 400 basis points lower than the industry average, excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recently publicly available data. Our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 7.32% in the third quarter, down from 7.63% a year ago and a peak of 8.96% in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "We added $462 million to our repurchase reserve this quarter, down $207 million from the second quarter.

Our repurchase reserve balance increased $269 million from the last quarter, reflecting $156 million of lower losses.", "New demands from GSCs were actually down in the third quarter; however, our outstanding repurchase demands were up from the second quarter. This increase reflects higher non-agency demands primarily due to new demands that have been previously reserved for. Agency outstanding demands were also up linked- quarter, which reflected the demands from increased file requests we highlighted last quarter, as well as the time it\u2019s taking to work through those demands with the agencies.", "As shown on page 19, our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 10.06%, down 2 basis points from the second quarter.

We have many examples listed on page 20. The main point is that across cycle different businesses drive our growth, which has been the reason for our consistent performance.", "In summary, our balanced business model produced strong results again this quarter.

Our ROE grew to 13.38% also within our target range of 12% to 15%. Our ability to achieve this growth in the low rate environment that is putting pressure on our net interest margin, and in a quarter when mortgage revenue actually declined slightly, clearly demonstrates the underlying momentum we have across our franchise.", "I\u2019ll now open the call up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "John G. Stumpf", "Good morning, Erika.", "Leanne Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. My first question was on the margin. Is there a seasonality in terms of deposit flows, because you have $92 billion average cash this quarter, and it was $98 billion last year same quarter. I\u2019m just wondering, we had sort of a similar step down, and more stability in other quarters. I'm just wondering, if there is a seasonality in deposit flows that we hadn\u2019t been taken to account?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Erika, that\u2019s a good question. I think throughout the year you can see some seasonality in our deposit flows. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily conclude that every third quarter we\u2019re going to have deposit growth like we had in the third quarter of last year and this year. But there is no question that part of the \u2013 and a big reason for the net interest margin decline was because of the strong deposit flows particularly what we saw in September.", "Leanne Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "And it\u2019s clear that the momentum in core loan growth should absorb some of that excess cash on a go-forward basis. But could you give us a sense of how you plan to deploy and how much of it of the excess cash that you plan to deploy on a go-forward basis, your reinvestment strategy that\u2019s not soaked up by core loan growth?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, the first call on any of our liquidity is for our customers, and it\u2019s really going to be focused on core loan growth. As you saw this quarter, we decided to hold $9.8 billion of our confirming first mortgage portfolio primarily, because we viewed it as a very good investment opportunity for us, given the risk award of holding those mortgages, which were very high-quality versus buying a similar duration MBS at a big premium.", "We were very cautious this quarter in terms of how we thought about our investment alternatives, and we are doing that, because we are thinking about the investment portfolio for the long-term.", "John G. Stumpf", "And Erika, I think that Tim is absolutely right on that. We are going to be very careful at this point in time, not to just go out there and stretch for yield and take on a lot of interest rate risk.", "Leanne Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "John G. Stumpf", "But the first call is always for our customers.", "Leanne Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And just one last question on the margin, and I\u2019ll step off. On slide 15, you mentioned that there was a $4.3 billion increase in the accretable yield, I guess the way I\u2019m thinking about this is, as the housing market in the U.S. recovers, you can continue to reclassify more of the non-accretable into accretable. And so that\u2019s clearly going to be margin support on a go-forward basis. And the negative impact that you\u2019ve mentioned on the margin this quarter, is that have to do with lower cash resolutions from the Wachovia legacy book than last quarter? And my thinking about the components put that way?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No. That\u2019s correct. The 10 basis points that we called out in the supplement was primarily because of lower resolutions, and as we mentioned, in second quarter, at higher resolutions, those are going to be volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But you\u2019re absolutely correct when you think about the impact on the non-accretable yield to accretable yield and then the expectation of cash flows from that portfolio that as the housing market continues to improve that we\u2019ll get benefit there.", "Leanne Erika Penala \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Got it. thank you for taking my questions.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thanks, Erika.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Tim, could you perhaps maybe just drill down a little more into what you\u2019re seeing from the agencies in terms of the put backs, and you talked about a little bit, could you kind of just \u2013 I mean some of your competitors have already kind of had their reserves to the point where they\u2019re beginning to drive them down, could you talk about that a little bit?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Sure. As we mentioned, we added $462 million to their purchase reserve this quarter, which was down from the second quarter, which was $669 million. There is a little bit of noise in the puts and takes here, because the new agency demand levels were actually down. so this sort of new agency demands were down this quarter, which is a good sign. I don\u2019t necessarily think that it means we should declare victory and there are always going to be down, but that\u2019s a good sign that we haven\u2019t seen for a while.", "The outstanding demands from the GSEs were actually up a little bit, and this reflects a couple of things; one, remember our expectations from last quarter as well as the fact that it\u2019s taken a little bit longer to work through our file request. But the non-agency demands were actually up this quarter. So, there\u2019s a lot going on there. and we continue to have a lot of discussion with the agencies, but there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve seen yet that would indicate that the decline that we saw this quarter is certainly a trend I hope it is, but I can\u2019t guarantee you that that\u2019s going to be the case.", "John G. Stumpf", "There are a couple of big, you step back a little bit, a couple of issues that are encouraging, first of all, real estate is getting better. we start in housing a year ago and every quarter we have more confidence that this, we\u2019re not back to where we need to be and it\u2019s not as robust as we\u2019d all want it to be. But that\u2019s good on the repurchase side as values go up. And secondly, we continue to get further and further away or it\u2019s further and really a mirror, the 2006 and 2008 portfolio. So every quarter we go, we\u2019re getting through that. So those are things that are encouraging.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great, just on the mortgage banking front, a couple of just interesting trends, it looks like you took the pedal off on the correspondent business of touch, and at the same time, took the valuation of your MSR down whereas the JPMorgan had taken it up a little bit. Just talk a little bit about how we should think about the interplay of, both origination volumes into the fourth quarter in 2013, and maybe perhaps the valuation to MSR?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Sure, I\u2019ll start with origination volume. We ended the quarter with a pipeline that was a little bit less than the second quarter, but it almost $100 billion, it\u2019s still very strong.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Right.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "And as we mentioned, volume has been strong so far this quarter being the fourth quarter. So we expect to have a pretty strong mortgage quarter in the fourth quarter. How long that last, don\u2019t know for sure, but it feels like, it\u2019s going to last at least a few quarters, and obviously, we hope it does.", "In terms of the MSR valuation, the change that we made this quarter was just to continue to take into consideration, the higher servicing and the foreclosure costs that we\u2019re seeing and to include that in the valuation of our MSR and that yielded $350 million write-down.", "Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great. Thank you.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joseph Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks, good morning.", "John G. Stumpf", "Good morning.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Hi, Joe.", "Joseph Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Just first following up on the mortgage, can you just also comment about gain on sale margin trends in the quarter and were they materially hired at all that you\u2019ve been, that means quarter end?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, they were 2.21%, which was about what it was in the second quarter at 2.2%.", "Joseph Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then beyond that, any thoughts on the potential impact of that, the Fed\u2019s NPRs, now you\u2019ve had more insight looking at that. And also just going into CCAR 2013, any thoughts about, you maybe, your approach in it would be any difference than last year?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, in terms of the NPRs, the Basel III estimate that we have for Tier 1 common equity takes into consideration a relatively conservative implementation of those. So the 8.02% number, we feel it\u2019s a pretty solid number based upon what we know today. We haven\u2019t gotten any further updates or indication just because it\u2019s a working process right now.", "As it relates to CCAR, we\u2019re really looking forward to going through a CCAR and we\u2019re looking forward to presenting our submission in the first quarter, because it\u2019s the way that we can continue to increase our capital return to our shareholders. And as you know, we had a very successful CCAR process this last year and our expectations are else we will have another successful one.", "John G. Stumpf", "Let me reiterate what Tim just said, which is really important. We are really focused on getting more capital back to our stockholders. That is, best way to do that is perform well as we\u2019re doing and have, the capital we have and Tim said, it\u2019s a lot of work to CCAR and we\u2019re looking forward to it.", "Joseph Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, Joe.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill.", "Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.", "I just want to ask another question on the margin. Is there anything that like surprised you in September, I guess just relative to where you\u2019ve been suggesting the month or so or ago that would be came in a little worse than that guidance? And then I guess along those lines, I think in the past you\u2019ve been pretty clear that you expected the margin to come under pressure, but by the same token I\u2019d hope that NII would be able to continue to grow. Do you think you can offer this quarter\u2019s base still generate positive NII growth?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, so, a few questions in there all good ones. The first one, our deposit growth was a little bit stronger in September than we had expected, which again is terrific, that\u2019s the way that we get most of our customers into the Wells Fargo. So we are happy with that.", "And secondly, we had a fewer resolutions than we had estimated. But I think it\u2019s really important to step back and just reflect on what\u2019s happened with our net interest margin over the past year. Certainly, the 25 basis point decline this quarter is high, but when you think about it year-over-year, our net interest margin is down 18 basis points.", "So when you think about what happened during that year, on a net interest margin decline of 18 basis points, our net interest income is up 1%, we\u2019ve grown deposits by $51 billion. We\u2019ve originated $519 billion of residential mortgages. Our efficiency ratio has improved from 59.5% to 57.1%. And so when you total all this up, and I\u2019m sorry, and credits improved and even adjusted for the OCC guidance, our loan losses were down 50 basis points. I say all that, because while net interest margin is an important factor to look at. What we really focus on is, earnings per share, and earnings per share were up 22% over that same period.", "And I think that really reflects the strength of our diversified model. There is no question that in this slow rate environment, the NIM will continue to be under pressure. Again, we don\u2019t believe that the 25 basis point decline that we saw this quarter is representative of what we\u2019ll see in the future. But what we do believe is that, our performance is going to be representative of what we are going to see in the future, because we\u2019ve got a very strong diversified model.", "And in answer to your last question, I do believe that, we can grow net interest income over time even in the phase of a declining net interest margin.", "Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.", "Okay. Perfect. That\u2019s a helpful color, I appreciate it. And then I just wanted to switch back to the decision to portfolios, some of the conforming mortgage as well. I definitely understand the rationale relative to some of the other investment alternatives that you would have, but I guess by the same token, putting on mortgages at historically low rates, potentially introduces some high risk of its own into the future. I guess, how did you kind of square that dynamic when you guys thought about it?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, I think it\u2019s a very fair point, a good question, because any time we put any asset on the books, we\u2019ve got to think about the risk. It\u2019s not only about what kind of return we can get in the short-term, but it\u2019s about the risk of owning that asset whether it\u2019s a loan or a security, or whatever.", "And so in making this decision, we took into consideration interest rate risk, credit risk, as well as concentration risk, and we are very comfortable given the size of our loan portfolio and the level of our liquidity and the level of interest rate risk that we have at the company that this incremental increase of $9.8 billion and the incremental mortgages that we mentioned that we will likely put on this quarter on the balance sheet is not going to significantly or materially affect our interest rate risk or credit risk.", "Jim Rowe", "If you think about this, we\u2019ve done this in the past. And again, it\u2019s one of the tools that we have, one of the leverage we can pull, and we see a very nice, a difference between the yield there versus if we bought RMBS as a security. And again, then you are paying 105 or 106, you are paying a premium and those things pay half yearly you know that premium amortization. So there is a lot of bouncing here. But we\u2019ve done this before, we\u2019re aware of that, it\u2019s something that we think about it.", "Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.", "Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Ed.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Hello, Ed.", "Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "So a couple of quick questions here. Just first in terms of retaining the conforming fixed-rate mortgages the $9.8 billion. Why is that a better decision then maybe retaining jumbo is that, might have a higher yield and have equal or better credit quality?", "John G. Stumpf", "Oh, Ed, yeah, we do that too.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Absolutely.", "Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "Given your giant origination volume, can\u2019t you just do more of that versus 30-year fixed conforming?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, we would like to do more of that and we\u2019ve got a very strong nonconforming or jumbo origination capability and we want to and we\u2019ll continue to grow that. But in addition to that, we thought it was a good idea given the risk written alternatives to hold these conforming mortgages too.", "And this is just an example of how we think about managing the company for the long-term. I mean, we could have taken that $9.8 billion and had a gain on sale, which would have been fine and increase the short-term earnings, but we thought it was better to hold these high credit quality mortgages to generate income over a longer period of time. And again we\u2019ve retained all of our nonconforming jumbo mortgages, we do not sell those.", "Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And then given what you\u2019ve done to sort of the overall accretable yield balance, taking that number up to almost $19 billion, which you talked about previously. Should we expect $495 million of quarterly accretable yield to NII to be a higher number in future quarters?", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah, it\u2019s going to be higher. I would describe it as being slightly higher, because it\u2019s over a longer period of time, 13 years plus. There is the disproportion of return that comes towards the end of the term of those mortgages, but there is no question, it will have a slightly positive impact on the net interest margin.", "Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, thanks. And then this question is again kind of specific to the margin. Looking at your C&I and your real estate mortgage yield, you\u2019re sort of prepared for the big drop in the commercial real estate mortgage yield from $462 million to $405 million, because I think that was obviously insulated into 2Q from the cash recoveries. But we also saw a pretty big drop in the yield on the C&I portfolio itself. Is there something going on in there other than the rate environment and competition, was there is some cash recovery in there as well in 2Q?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "There was a little bit of cash recovery in the second quarter. And again, you also have the impact of the liquidating portfolio kind of running off. But I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 and again if you look back even on a five quarter basis, you\u2019ve seen some volatility in that number. But there is also an impact from some lower loan recoveries that we got in the second quarter. But I would necessarily look at that decline, the level of that decline a trend.", "Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. Would you feel like that $384 million number on the C&I yield is something that should remain more stable going forward?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Gosh, I hope so. There is no question that there is a fair amount of competition out there for assets. I don\u2019t \u2013 but again, I don\u2019t think you should look at the $421 million to $384 as a trend that you are going to see on a quarterly basis. There certainly could be some impact and some future decline, but the 384 number feels pretty good.", "Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "And then lastly and I\u2019ll stop.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "", "Yeah.", "Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "On operating costs, probably absorbing clearly to next year costs related to the strong mortgage origination pipeline and volume. can you maybe frame operating expenses for us over the next few quarters sort of in two pieces: number one, what we might see in terms of core expense reductions and \u2013 apart from mortgage? And number two, what we might see in terms of savings on the mortgage side as the refi volume ultimately comes down?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, our guess as it relates to the best estimate in terms of the refi volume is that that\u2019s going to continue on for a few quarters. so I don\u2019t expect any sort of decline in expenses until that occurs. And it\u2019s again, I doubt it\u2019s going to be next quarter, the quarter after that.", "In terms of other expenses, clearly, and when you look at the mortgage business, we have other environmental expenses that are elevated for things like the consent order, the servicing settlement, and just the fact that, well, the portfolio has continued to improve, we still have higher than normal cost. And my guess is that those are going to start begin to tail down some time probably in the second half of next year.", "and in terms of, then just the base operating expenses, as John mentioned, as I mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to look at expense reduction in the company, but we want to do it in a way that\u2019s very focused on the efficiency ratio, because in this environment while we want to be more efficient, we don\u2019t want to give up good revenue opportunities. John, I don\u2019t know.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah. Let me maybe expand that a bit. Ed, you\u2019re asking the right question. We still think expenses are too high here. But we\u2019ve also said we\u2019re not going to be slavish to a number and turn away revenue. So if we look year-over-year compared to the third quarter of \u201911 we\u2019re up now in the expenses of $500 million, but our revenue was up $1.6 billion. So, we think that was a good trade.", "That being said, we can be more efficient. there are some expenses that we\u2019re getting through compliance and consent and other things that we\u2019ll get better at, that will go away. but even in spite of all of that, we still think we have \u2013 our operating expenses are too high and we\u2019re focused on that, but we want to do it smartly. And a 57% efficiency ratio, we\u2019ve come a long way from the low 60s. And we\u2019ve picked up 240 basis points in a year and we still think we have more room to go. And that\u2019s well within our guidelines of 55% to 59%.", "Edward R. Najarian \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thanks, Ed.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Good morning, guys.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Hi.", "John G. Stumpf", "Good morning.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Just on \u2013 just back to the margin commentary, can you help us frame just kind of the magnitude of how much pressure we should still expect going forward, after the re-stepping down to 366 ranges, is it going to be in the 5 to 10 range or how do we think of the output given, the number of moving parts still?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, I know it can be a little bit frustrating to try to predict any sort of decline in the net interest margin. And part of that is because on a quarterly basis, it can be pretty volatile. I mean if you look back a year ago in the third quarter, our net interest margin was down 17 basis points and then it was up in the fourth quarter, and then it was flat for a couple of quarters. So if you step back and look at it year-over-year, it\u2019s being down 18 basis points. Could we see another 18 to 20 basis points decline in the year, sure we could. Could it be up to 25, you bet. Could it be 15, right, and so that you could see that much change, but we could also see another quarter in the next quarter where it\u2019s up.", "Again what we focus on, right, is not managing to the net interest margin and again reason for that is the following. We could have easily increased our net interest margin by making some bad short-term decisions. For example, we could increase the duration of our investment portfolio. We could go out and buy a lot of securities that have good short-term yield, but have higher credit risk, right.", "That maybe a good short-term decision in terms of managing to the net interest margin, it could be a bad long-term decision in terms of how we\u2019re managing this company for the long-term, which again is why we don\u2019t spend the whole lot of time being focused on managing to that margin, but again back to the original question, \u201cCould we see the same kind of decline year-over-year that we\u2019ve seen this year?\u201d We certainly could.", "John G. Stumpf", "And the other side, think of it, the other half of our revenue comes from non-interest income. And we\u2019ve shown very good growth in that area. So even though as we gain new households, new customers, if they are not borrowing or if spreads are lower there, we do a lot of other things with these folks. And we\u2019ve seen good growth in that area. So overall revenue, year-over-year up 8% those are pretty good numbers.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Got it. And then I hear correctly from the earlier question, I think it was Scott, who asked that the NII should and can\u2019t improve from here despite the pressure on a linked quarter basis.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, yes, absolutely.", "John G. Stumpf", "Sure.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay. And then is the margin pressure, is this going to last for year and I guess feels like the industry through next year as well, if this current environment remains?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "", "Yeah.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "", "Okay. And then on expenses, the target of 55% to 59%, should we think about that being a target that for next year as well?", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah, we should. Yeah, that\u2019s a good question. We announced the 55% to 59% at Investor Day in May. And we did at Investor Day because we didn\u2019t want that to be viewed as a range that was for one quarter, two quarter. That\u2019s the range that we believe that we can operate in. Again there\u2019s going to be some seasonality in our expenses. Our expenses are generally up a little bit in the first quarter because of compensational related items. But we think that we can operate within that range, and will be using that range for the time being.", "Andrew Marquardt \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Good morning.", "John G.

You said something about hopefully those start to tail off back half of next year. I realize this is probably somewhat of a guesstimate like, why is it taking so long for those cost to come down with loan price just raising and some more guidelines on the servicing side? I think what do you think it could be another year, before we see a meaningful decline in those areas?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "", "Let me separate them into two groups, Matt. The costs that related to just managing the portion of the problem loan portfolio, whether it\u2019s in mortgage or anywhere else within the company, and those are continuing to come down. And so I didn\u2019t mean to imply and apologize if I did that that, that we are \u2013 we don\u2019t think those are going to come down until next year. The cost that I was referring to are, what I would describe as the environmental cost related to complying with the consent order and also the servicing settlement and those are works in process right now and it\u2019s going to take us through next year to be able to \u2013 to work through the servicing settlement and comply with the consent order. So there is really kind of two different categories Matt.", "John G. Stumpf", "And for example, the new supervisory standards just became effective I think October 1, I mean now we have a front run in that, but it takes a while to get those really worked into your system and become efficient on those.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.", "And how much are the cost, how much are those the consent and serving delay cost in the third quarter?", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah, what we disclosed in the supplement that is the third-party costs related to the consent order about $100 million a quarter and as it relates to the cost for the servicing settlement, we didn\u2019t disclose those, but assume there is some addition to that.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Okay. So I guess the bigger portion though is just the cost of servicing some of the troubled borrowers, that part is coming down, because I\u2019d think that\u2019s the biggest piece of your\u2026", "Timothy J. Sloan", "That will continue to come down as the portfolio continues to improve, which is what we\u2019ve been seeing.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Okay. And then just separately on the mortgage side, how elevated are the production related expenses just like in an absolute dollar, what are those costs this quarter?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Now, I\u2019m not going to disclose that, because then everybody know exactly what our margins are and that\u2019s a important from a competitive standpoint.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Is there anything you can size around like year-over-year expenses are up X and X% of that is due to higher mortgage or anyway to frame that a little bit for us?", "John G. Stumpf", "No.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "That it \u2013 it takes more time now to underwrite a loan, I mean there is more expense on that but we are working through those things.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "I\u2019m going to guess it\u2019s at a very high level like, it seems like there\u2019s some puts and takes on the production related expenses, a lot more legwork needs to be done to get loans approved whether it\u2019s refi or purchase, yet, I think the headcount adds been a lot less for the industry and technology is better. So it\u2019s just hard to put it all together. I mean it seems like there is some elevation on expenses, but maybe no there is much to say, few years ago when hiring\u2019s were more meaningful.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, Matt I think it\u2019s a really fair question and in fairness state, the entire industry or anybody that\u2019s in the mortgage business today there is a lot of change that\u2019s going on. And so I think it\u2019s hard to kind of put a hard dollar cost to, this has really been what the impact to the change because it\u2019s still a work in process, I\u2019d have to step back and just again focus on the overall efficiency ratio for the company, which has continued to improve over this last year as John said by about 2.5% and even in the last quarter by over 100 basis points.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay.", "John G. Stumpf", "But we are adding people to deal with volumes and to get the throughput.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "You don\u2019t disclose the headcount in the mortgage company, do you?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Not separately, no.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Excellent. All right. Thank you.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just one more, you kind of all encompassing question on expenses. So understanding the efficiency ratio points that you make at the top of the company, and the progression that's been made with total expenses continuing to come down through the last couple of quarters, can you give us a framework of how to just think about the overall expense base, just going ahead, because I would think you still have some annualization of the cost savings programs, you\u2019ve got the environmental costs that we just, that Matt just asked about.", "And then there is this unanswerable question right now about how much is in the mortgage business, but so can you just help us frame how are you going to be thinking about just the overall cost base from a dollar's perspective as we think about 2013 over 2012 just from an operating leverage perspective?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah, well, I think you made an important point there at the end. And that is, we're looking at operating leverage and we're looking at efficiency ratio. And so, we are not focused on saying, look, here is the hard dollar reduction that we want to see year-over-year. What we want to see is, we want to see sequential improvement in our efficiency ratio. Now again, the first quarter in every year is going to be a little bit different, but the way that we are measuring, our people who are measuring the businesses is to see that sequential improvement in the efficiency ratio. So we don't have a specific dollar target for next year, but we want to improve the efficiency ratio, so we can get down to stay in the middle to get down to the lower end of the range that we set.", "John G. Stumpf", "And I would also say that we want to make sure that for businesses like mortgage that have volume differences, one year could be much higher, when volumes do have, or the business contracts, we are able to adjust expenses in a similar way that's extremely important in that business.", "Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "", "So I guess the broad takeaway is that, next year you would still see the ability to improve the efficiency ratio from where it currently stands?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "", "Yeah, again let me, what we are looking for, the way that we measure our businesses internally is look for sequential improvement in operating leverage, in every business regardless of what the business is.", "John G. Stumpf", "Absolutely.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Right. So that it takes into consideration not only the revenue opportunities that the businesses are seeing and you\u2019ve seen that in our results this quarter across the broad in many businesses, but also asking them to become more efficient at the same time.", "Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "", "Okay, got. And my second question is just about the trust and investment fees business obviously had good sequential improvement. I was just wondering if you could provide a little color about the momentum you\u2019re seeing there and also obviously, December was a tough environment on the volumes base side of things, but there were still growth in the business. So we\u2019re seeing an incremental bit of momentum there in the core business and just any changes you\u2019re seeing in terms of customer activity and the outlook for growth in that part of the company?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I think a couple of things, one, we did see and we are continuing to see some momentum there. I think David Carroll, at our Investor Day did a terrific job in kind of walking through the opportunities that we see in that business, in his business and then in our investment banking business, John Stumpf did a nice job kind of walking you through that at Investor Day, so we\u2019re seeing some good momentum. And I think the other thing that\u2019s really important when you think about the trusts and investment fees is that, the mix is also improving, so that we\u2019re seeing more of that the mix coming from advisory fees, and asset management fees as opposed to just transactional activity. So we\u2019re optimistic that we can continue to grow not only within those businesses, but also that line item.", "John G. Stumpf", "And part of the secret sauce there is, David and his team\u2019s ability to work across businesses within the company. So he worked very closely with the community banking side, led by Carrie Tolstedt, very closely with Dave Hoyt in the wholesale side. So there\u2019s lots of work together, because many of our customers who call us their bank, keep their wealth some place else. So there is \u2013 we have huge opportunity in this business.", "Kenneth M. Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.", "Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Very much and I hate to go back to the NIM, but I want to talk a little bit about the securities portfolio. It did increase a little bit. But what type of \u2013 and you talked about this in the opening remarks about that some of the NIM pressure is coming from the securities portfolio, but what type of the CPR rates were you\u2019re seeing, I know you had some really high yielding stuff that is probably prepaying very fast?", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah. You know what Paul, it\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t have the CPR rates on an individual security basis handy. we can get back to you with that.", "Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. And then, the other question is \u2013 and then the subhead, can you at least tell us where it\u2019s coming on, is it coming on in the 15, once that new stuff coming on board?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, there is no question that we saw some increase in the CPR levels in some of the newer securities. but again, we\u2019ll get back to you with some more detail.", "Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "What yield are you buying these securities on?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "What yield, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.", "Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Yeah, yeah.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Open up, it\u2019s whatever the yield is today in the market. I think that the more important point is that when we saw rates declined significantly, and then we saw the demand for the underlying securities really increased, so that you\u2019re looking at buying these at a significant premium. That\u2019s the point at which we said, you know what, this just doesn\u2019t feel very good to us in terms of making a long-term decision and where we focused on keeping more of the conforming mortgages.", "Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. and one real quick question, what is \u2013 you might release, you might have it somewhere, but I can\u2019t see it. What is your annualized servicing fee?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Our annualized servicing fee?", "John G. Stumpf", "On mortgage?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah.", "Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "No, on the MS, for your servicing portfolio, I\u2019m sorry guys.", "John G. Stumpf", "You mean the valuation...", "Timothy J. Sloan", "63 basis points.", "John G. Stumpf", "You mean the valuation?", "Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "That\u2019s your capitalized cost of servicing. Your annualized servicing fee?", "John G. Stumpf", "25 bps.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "25 basis points.", "Paul J. Miller \u2013 FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. Thanks a lot guys.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hey, Mike.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities", "Hi, my question is on mortgages past, present, and future. so let\u2019s start with the mortgages past, I mean the decision to retain the mortgages on the balance sheet, do you still have the option to sell those retained mortgages, because you\u2019re passing up some revenues today, it\u2019s tying up more capital and there is a tradeoff there, isn\u2019t there?", "John G. Stumpf", "Sure. There is.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Sure.", "John G. Stumpf", "And we think it\u2019s a good tradeoff to make today, but holding these mortgages today doesn\u2019t preclude our ability to sell them in the future.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities", "So you could sell them today or in a month or in three months, you think?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, I don\u2019t think we could sell them tomorrow, but we could sell them in the future certainly.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "You have to securitize them and\u2026", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities", "Okay.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "You got to get him wrapped and \u2013 but yeah, we could do that.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities", "And then as far as the mortgages today, you said the applications were down from the second quarter to the third quarter and you might have thought with QE3, the application volume would have increased. So what has the application volume down from the end of the third quarter until today?", "John G. Stumpf", "Let me pause your mortgage present for a minute. The pipeline at the end of the third quarter was down slightly from the end of the second quarter by, I think, $5 billion or $6 billion is still very high. Our mortgage volume in the third quarter was higher than in the second quarter and may be just gets into a little bit of the mortgage future. What we\u2019re seeing so far this quarter is that volume is up.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "", "And remember we get out of the wholesale business from the third quarter.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities", "", "All right. So volume is up so far this quarter versus the second quarter, especially it would be good to the fourth quarter?", "John G. Stumpf", "I hope, if it continues.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities", "Okay. But the more general question for the future, you said this should last maybe a few more quarters as far as the mortgage boom in terms of the revenues, but then it falls off. So my question is, could you offset that falloff entirely through actions at the mortgage company or would that be where the diversified model comes into play and you would expect other business lines to pick the slack?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "", "Well, there is a lot of variables in the question you just asked. What\u2019s the economy going to look like, where our interest rate is going to be? But I think what you\u2019ve seen this quarter and not only what you\u2019ve seen this quarter, but what you\u2019ve seen for the last few quarters and the last year is that because we\u2019ve got a diversified model, you\u2019re seeing growth in a number of businesses. I can\u2019t promise you that in the quarter that we see a decline in the mortgage business that everyone of those business is going to be able to pickup the complete slack. I hope it does, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen historically, when we\u2019ve gone through these peaks and valleys in the mortgage business. But again, that\u2019s the benefit of the model that we\u2019ve got and that we\u2019ve got other levers to pull, there is other horses that are pulling the stagecoach.", "John G. Stumpf", "And Mike, another thing you need to think about is 75% of our mortgage volume this past quarter was refinanced and 25% was purchase money. That\u2019s still a very low overall purchase money market. As we see real estate continue to improve as refis ebb, we might see the purchase volume pick up. So that\u2019s a natural offset. Furthermore as the purchasing volume or if rate rise and those things slowdown, then the servicing asset peoples were valuable. So we have all those things going on, besides the diversified model.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities", "", "But at the end of the day, even with the improving in the servicing asset, even with more purchase volume, even with the expense cut in the mortgage unit, chances are you\u2019d still have to rely on some, as you would say, horses outside the mortgage area.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah, absolutely. That\u2019s the exciting part. We free them all.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah.", "John G. Stumpf", "They are all pulling.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities", "Just last follow-up because this is the main question I think. How you manage to hand off from the mortgage boom to the time you cut the expenses? How do you know when to start cutting those expenses? What signs are you looking at?", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, the mortgage business, as you can imagine, this is not the first \u2013 we\u2019ve in this a long time, we have terrific leaders there. And they see volumes on a \u2013 not hourly, but at daily basis and they have been very good at dialing up and dialing down to adjust to volumes. Now there is truly a fixed component there, but we\u2019ve done this. This is not the first up or down we\u2019ve seen in this business. We\u2019ve seen many of those.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities", "But isn\u2019t this time different, I mean if we had QE4 that could change your whole analysis right? Isn\u2019t it\u2026", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, you might get exactly right. We had \u2013 we didn\u2019t know QE3 was coming and now we\u2019re adding people. And if QE3 lasts, if the volumes last for 12 months versus six months, we will make adjustments up or down based on that.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities", "", "Are you able to say how many people you\u2019ve added?", "John G. Stumpf", "I don\u2019t think \u2013 no, we\u2019d not say that, but we\u2019re adding people.", "Michael Mayo \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities", "Okay. All right, thanks a lot.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "", "Your next question will come from the line of Greg Ketron with UBS.", "Gregory W. Ketron \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "", "Good morning.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Good morning.", "Gregory W. Ketron \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Just a variation of all the mortgage questions that you\u2019ve answered this morning. Kind of looking at the 2013 the MBA forecast calls for volumes to be off, you know maybe 20% to a size of 30%, I know that MBA forecast is about as accurate as a weather forecast. But if you look at that type of scenario are there things that you can do maybe on the pricing side or products side, and increase market share in light of the scenario that would have mortgage production coming down that much?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, I mean, yeah, we can \u2013 you could always lower your prices and take up share, but I don\u2019t know, necessarily think that\u2019s a good \u2013 a good decision always going to be a good decision from a profit standpoint. And it\u2019s a very competitive market out there, we don\u2019t run the business based upon on share, we run the business based upon profitability. Our first call continues to be focused on our retail origination network and then also secondly our corresponding network.", "As you said, the MBA forecast it could be right, it could be wrong. I think everybody has been surprised that how long this refinance boom has lasted, as I said, we think it\u2019s going to last for a few more quarters. And again, at some point, it\u2019s going to slowdown. As John said, there might be a mix change, we hope there will be and there will be more purchase money mortgages. But again, the important thing is we\u2019ve been through this before. This isn\u2019t something that the folks in our mortgage business or the management team at this company hasn\u2019t seen before in terms of cyclicality in the mortgage business and we will adjust to it.", "Gregory W. Ketron \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. Right. And then in terms of the \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.", "John G. Stumpf", "I would just add remember on our mortgage business, half of our business is through correspondence. So the adjustment we are going to make is really on a 16% share or something.", "Gregory W. Ketron \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. Great. And in terms of what you are seeing maybe so far this quarter, we know, if you look at the primary to secondary mortgage spread that widened out quite a bit so especially after QE3 was announced. Is there \u2013 your sense that you are going to continue to see mortgage rates work their way down and maybe some pressure on that spread in the fourth quarter?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "I don\u2019t know that answer to that. I mean clearly the spreads are attractive today, the costs are up too and the GC was up also. We are hopeful that the margins will continue to be at their present level, but it\u2019s competitive out there. And I think the one thing we know from history in the mortgage business is that when you are at a high level of margin there generally tends to be more pressure down than up. And again, it\u2019s competitive, but it\u2019s a very attractive business for us to be in and we\u2019re really pleased that we are originating one of every three mortgages that\u2019s done in the country.", "John G. Stumpf", "And it\u2019s also a very good deal for consumers, I mean consumers are getting bargained these days, if you look at the rates on the street. This is very \u2013 and this is probably the best time ever to buy a house. Most affordable.", "Gregory W. Ketron \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Great. Well, thank you very much.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "A question on the nonperformers, it\u2019s just another way of getting at the expense question, because obviously you\u2019ve got carrying cost associated with the nonaccrual and foreclosed assets and I\u2019m just wondering about how much more rapidly we could expect you would, try to bring this balance down. We\u2019ve had a change in the short sale program from the FHFA, which I would expect would be one opportunity to accelerate this shrinkage, but maybe I\u2019m wrong there? Maybe, if you could give us some color on what your thoughts are?", "John G. Stumpf", "Sure, Betsy, I think if you look at kind of that five quarter chart that we had in the supplement. You go back to the third quarter of last year, our total non-performing assets were about, I\u2019m going to round you about $27 billion. The improvement over the last year has been pretty significant with the exception that we\u2019ve had the OCC guidance in the first quarter, and then in this quarter that raised it. So what we\u2019re seeing is $1 billion plus decline in NPAs more or less on a quarterly basis, absent that guidance and our expectation is that it\u2019s reasonable to assume that that can continue.", "Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "But could you do anything to accelerate that?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "We could and we look at that all the time in terms of what\u2019s the best economic return for the company, not necessarily driven by ratios. but, yeah, I mean and so not only do we look at working out loans on a loan-by-loan basis, but also in the past quarters, we\u2019ve sold our packages of non-performing assets. and we\u2019ll continue to look at that and if the economics are there, and if the economics get better than we could certainly accelerate that.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah, Tim is right about that. It\u2019s based on economics; I mean we don\u2019t feel there is any reason to do something that\u2019s uneconomic. if that\u2019s economic, that\u2019d be terrific.", "Betsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "The short sale rule change anything in terms of helping you accelerate this or not really?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "", "Not really.", "John G. Stumpf", "", "Not really, because most short sales never get to the balance sheet, right. I mean if it\u2019s many of those are done on behalf of our investors, and it\u2019s so that will spend much time if at anything in your NPA area.", "Betsy L.

Mutascio \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "You can do a debate I think given all the (inaudible). Looking at your cash and your Fed funds sold at the end of period, you\u2019re almost up to $120 billion pretty darn close to 9% of your total assets. I understand you\u2019d mentioned you\u2019re more prudent in terms of reinvestment right now given where rates are? My question is, though it looks like you\u2019re holding cash a bit though, are there any opportunities out there for a typical, the type of loan pool purchases you\u2019ve made in the past. I think they kind of slow of late, are you seeing any type of ramp up in those opportunities out there?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yeah. you\u2019re correct, I mean we didn\u2019t have a medium-size or large acquisition we did this quarter like, we\u2019ve had over the last few quarters. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily conclude that that\u2019s a trend that we won\u2019t continue to see those. We still have a pretty robust pipeline of opportunities out there. And so we\u2019re not necessarily holding cash to make sure that we\u2019ve got the ability to do it, because even if we had $20 billion or $30 billion less the cash, we would be more than liquid enough to be able to accomplish an acquisition. We\u2019re continued to be very focused on looking at good acquisition opportunities. we\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish in the last year. And we\u2019re hopeful to see that we\u2019ll continue to see those types of opportunities, but the pipeline is still there.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yeah. and I would say that the level is more because we can\u2019t \u2013 the opportunities are not, the risk reward is not the right kind of thing. and we haven\u2019t found anything that that make sense for us. But if it\u2019d be half that, if we could find great asset, that\u2019d be great.", "Christopher M. Mutascio \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "All right.", "John G.

Stumpf", "Good morning, Marty.", "Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "I want to take us back into the margin and mortgage just for a second, but a little different twist. If you\u2019re looking at the variable income more employment figure out is that, you met the five quarters over this period of time, you end up with a negative five basis points. So in general, you got to start at some point, and I\u2019m just curious, do you say that, would you think that the resolutions are lower than normal, at normal, kind of where we\u2019re yet going forward on that particular item?", "John G. Stumpf", "Marty, for this quarter, the resolutions were a little bit, were clearly lower than what we\u2019ve seen in the last four or five, six quarters.", "Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "", "So, because I was looking at last quarter there, obviously elevated, but if you look back over time that would more than compensated with a little drop-off that you had in this quarter?", "John G. Stumpf", "That\u2019s correct.", "Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Okay. and then when you look at mortgage, one of the things that\u2019s interesting to me is, as you look at the roll-off of the income that you\u2019re getting there, one of the things that helps cushion that blow is in periods when you have higher revenue potential, you find ways to kind of offset that. So in other words, if you look at holding the mortgages, that would have lowered your revenues by like you said, a little bit more than $200 million.", "In this quarter you adjusted your servicing cost and you incorporated a higher cost going forward that lowered the number by $482 million. So if you look at those two adjustments that we\u2019re kind of incorporated in the $2.8 billion, there was a potential to earn $3.5 billion, which is about 20% higher, 20% to 25% higher than what you actually earn. So part of being able to cushion the future run-off and that you just kind of shave some of the peak off, which helps to cushion the ball later on", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, you\u2019re correct, Marty, particularly as it relates to the decision to hold the conforming production, and keeping on balance sheet, and to have that income flow over a longer period of time during the term of the mortgages as opposed to recognize its gain on sale. So, yeah, I mean there\u2019s no question that when you look at the mortgage business today is very strong.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "All of it\u2019s not flowing to the bottom line because of the couple of things that happened in the sense of the servicing costs and holding the mortgages. So you could have recognized if, every quarter you\u2019re not going to have servicing cost fee we have adjusted higher, that\u2019s not something you normally do.", "John G. Stumpf", "I certainly hope, I hope that that\u2019s correct Marty. But we did this quarter, we thought it was prudent to do it. But I hope we don\u2019t have a repeat of that in the next few quarters.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "And then just kind of lastly putting all that together down to, if you think of the decision you made to hold more mortgages of the decision to hold more liquidity, you are going through a process of, kind of storing up revenues that you can deploy at a better time down the future. So the linked and the life of that mortgage that you held will give you income through the cycle and over the next probably seven to 10 years.", "If you look at the liquidity, when interest rates eventually begin to rise, which is when refi come down, you can deploy that at a much more advantageous time and create some positive there. So just on those two decisions that you tangibly made, there was about $0.04 of earnings in this quarter that helps future earnings down the road.", "John G. Stumpf", "Marty, that\u2019s a great summation of how we think about the company over the long-term. We\u2019ve got to make good long-term decisions everyday as opposed to, let\u2019s make a good short-term decision that doesn\u2019t have a good long-term benefit. And so that\u2019s exactly how we think about managing this company.", "Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "And, my past history is the way that this works the best is managing the quarters in which you have extra earnings for future investing into the future versus really taking the weaker quarters and trying to clock them off. You make the most traction in creating future earning streams taking those peaks and putting them out into future quarters. So I appreciate it. Thanks.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you, Marty.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.", "Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "My question was actually asked about 12 different ways, so we can call it a day. Thanks.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "All right. Thanks, Chris. I appreciate it.", "John G. Stumpf", "Well, thanks everybody for joining us and your interest and the way you follow our company. We\u2019ll see you at the end of the fourth quarter. Thank you very much. Bye, bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

(Operator Instructions) After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "", "Jim Rowe", "", "Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will review fourth quarter and full year results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.", "Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings; including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim. Happy new year everyone and thanks for joining us today. We\u2019re excited to share our strong results for the quarter and for the year. We just completed our 12th consecutive quarter of EPS growth with record quarterly earnings in the fourth quarter of $5.1 billion, 24% from a year ago. These strong quarterly results are just part of an outstanding year of achievement for Wells Fargo.", "Let me start by highlighting all that was accomplished during 2012. We earned a record $18.9 billion in 2012, up 19% from 2011, and we also grew earnings per share by 19%. We generated 6% revenue growth and pre-tax pre-provision increased by 13%. We improved our efficiency ratio by 250 basis points to 58.5% for the year.", "We grew total loans by $30 billion, up 4% while reducing our liquidating portfolio by $18 billion. Our liquidating portfolio is now half the size it was four years ago at the time of the Wachovia merger. We now have over $1 trillion of deposits, up 9% from a year ago.", "Credit quality continued to improve but charge-offs is down $2.3 billion. We achieved a record retail banking cross-sell of over six products for household. We grew return on assets by 16 basis points and increased return on equity by 102 basis points. We increased capital levels growing our estimated tier 1 common equity under Basel III to 8.18%.", "We increased our dividend by 83% and repurchased approximately 120 million shares of common stock. In addition to these financial metrics, we also continued to grow organically and through acquisition purchasing loan portfolios and several businesses which not only brought new customers to Wells Fargo but allowed us to better meet the financial needs of all of our customers.", "The housing market began a steady rebound during 2012 while many measures of activity and prices remained low by historical standards and a complete recovery will still take some time. There is no doubt that a corner was turned which is a real positive for our economy and for Wells Fargo.", "We originated $524 billion in residential mortgages in 2012, helping over 2 million homeowners refinance or purchase a new home. Our industry, our regulators and our elected officials made progress this past year in helping to restore some stability to the housing market. Early in the year we finalized an agreement with the AGs and federal agencies regarding mortgage servicing, foreclosure and origination issues.", "We also reached the settlement with the Department of Justice regarding origination practices and as we just announced, we reached the settlement associated with Independent Foreclosure Reviews which will end the large quarterly expenses associated with the Consent Order.", "And regarding the draft, the qualified mortgage definition that was just published yesterday, we are still reviewing the details. But so far, it looks like the CFPB issued a rule that should benefit consumers across America by providing strong protection, while also ensuring that credit is available. By putting these issues behind us, we can focus more of our resources on serving our customers and creating long-term franchise value.", "We generate strong results in 2012 even with regulatory changes and an uncertain economic and political environment. As we start the New Year, we believe we will benefit from some signs of growth that we are seeing in the economy, jobs are being created and home prices are increasing.", "However, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. The last minute agreement that averted the fiscal cliff was a good step but it did not fix our country\u2019s long-term problems. We need to work on both sides of the equation, spending reductions and revenue increases.", "We need to increase clarity, certainty and confidence, and we can do this if the private and public sectors work together with the unified focus on strengthening our nation\u2019s financial and economic future, uncertainty is the enemy of business and we simply cannot afford that today.", "We know our customers especially in the small and middle market segments needs certainty and clarity. They have cash and the desire to grow. We need confidence so they can feel encourage to invest and hire again.", "With all that we accomplished last year, I believe Wells Fargo has never been better positioned and I\u2019m very optimistic about the year ahead. Wells Fargo is over 160 years old and we continue to manage our company for the long-term. The vision that has guided us for decades, meeting our customer\u2019s financial needs will continue to drive our growth in the year ahead.", "Thank you again for joining us today. And now Tim Sloan, our Chief Financial Officer will provide more details on our financial results. Tim?", "Tim Sloan", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. My remarks will follow the presentation included in the first half of the quarterly supplement, starting on page two, and then John and I will take your questions.", "As John mentioned, Wells Fargo had a very strong quarter, with record earnings of $5.1 billion, up 24% from year ago. Earnings per share were a record $0.91, up 25% from the fourth quarter of last year. We\u2019ve now achieved 12 consecutive quarters of earnings per share growth and the seven consecutive quarters of record EPS.", "Total revenue of $21.9 billion was up 7% from year ago. We grew revenue on a year-over-year basis every quarter in 2012. We also generated positive operating leverage. Pre-tax pre-provision profit increased 12% from year ago and we continue to have strong credit performance.", "We generated strong deposit in loan growth. Our ROA was 1.46%, up 21 basis points from year ago and our ROE was 13.35%, up 138 basis points from year ago. Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III growing to 8.18%.", "As you can see on page three, our fourth quarter results build on the strong performance we achieved throughout the year. As John highlighted and as the charts on this slide demonstrate, we had an outstanding year of growth across a variety of measures. Revenues grew by 6%. Net income grew by 19%. We had solid growth in loans and strong deposit growth. Our ROA was 1.41% for the year and ROE was 12.95%.", "We are in a much better position today than we were year ago and we look forward to taking advantage of all of the opportunities ahead of us. Our continued strong quarterly and annual performance reflected the benefit of our customer focused business model and our diversified sources of growth. The combination of our scale and our level of diversification is a significant advantage for our company.", "Before I review the drivers of our results this quarter let me spend some time discussing some noteworthy items that impacted our results as highlighted on slide five. Taken together, these items had little impact on our bottom-line but they did cause some unevenness in some of our line items. ", "Our gains on equity investments this quarter totaled $715 million. Our private equity business has been a core part of Wells Fargo for a long time and by its very nature results in this business can vary. The results in the fourth quarter were $393 million higher than the previous 7 quarter average reflecting strength in our private equity business, including the gain on the sale of Becker Underwood. The $393 million of above average equity gains equates to $0.05 of EPS. ", "Our total operating losses this quarter reflected $644 million of incremental accrual to fully reserve for our costs associated with the independent foreclosure review settlement that was announced earlier this week and additional remediation related costs. This accrual reduced EPS by $0.09. We contributed $250 million to the Wells Fargo Foundation reducing EPS by $0.03 continuing our commitment of giving back to the communities that we serve. ", "Finally, our income tax expense in the quarter included a $332 million benefit associated with the realization for tax purposes of a previously written down Wachovia life insurance investment which reduced our fourth quarter effective tax rate to 27.4%. This benefited EPS by $0.06 a share. ", "Let me briefly highlight the impact of the independent foreclosure review settlement. Our portion of the cash settlement was $766 million and as I just mentioned, our operating losses this quarter reflected $644 million to fully reserve for the settlement and additional remediation related costs. ", "We also committed to an additional $1.2 billion for foreclosure prevention actions which will not result in any additional charges since it is covered through our existing allowance and PCI non-accretable difference. We are pleased to have the high cost of complying with the consent order behind us, which when taking into account both the internal and external costs resulted in approximately $125 million in quarterly expenses in 2012. ", "Let me comment on some of our key drivers this quarter, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail later in my remarks. Our balance sheet growth accelerated in the fourth quarter with solid growth in loans and continued strong deposit growth. Our short-term investments in Fed fund sold balances increased by $36.9 billion and we grew our AFS portfolio by $5.8 billion, including agency MBS purchasers that occurred late in the quarter as rates rose and yields became more attractive. Our credit quality also continued to improve in the fourth quarter as it did throughout 2012. ", "Turning to the income statement on page eight, we generated robust revenue in the fourth quarter reflecting strong non-interest income growth across our businesses and stable net interest income. The increase in non-interest expense was entirely driven by the higher operating losses in the foundation contribution that I highlighted earlier. ", "Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page 9, period end loans were up $30 billion from the fourth quarter of 2011 and up $17 billion from the third-quarter of this year. This is the largest linked quarter increase over the past four years. ", "Commercial loans grew $8.7 billion in the quarter. This growth reflected strong activity in a number of businesses, middle market lending, commercial real estate, asset-backed finance and corporate banking. Consumer loans increased by $8.3 billion with growth in first mortgage, auto, credit card and private student lending. This growth benefited from the retention of $9.7 billion of new conforming fixed-rate production similar to last quarter.", "With the recent increase in rates providing better investment opportunities we currently do not plan to retain any -- retain additional first-quarter production. We do expect to hold an additional $2 billion to $3 billion of our fourth quarter originations that we\u2019ll fund this month. This demonstrates the flexibility of our diversified model. Our liquidating portfolio continued to shrink declining $17.8 billion from a year ago and down $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter.", "We continue to have strong deposit growth in the fourth quarter with average deposits up $64 billion from a year ago and up $29.6 billion from the third quarter with growth across our franchise. We also continue to lower our deposit costs with average deposit cost down -- of 16 basis points in the fourth quarter, down two basis points from the third quarter and down six basis points from a year ago.", "Our ability to continue to grow deposits while reducing costs has been a real strength of our franchise. While this strong deposit growth continued to put pressure on our margin, it is important to note that given most of this growth was a non-interest bearing deposits, this deposit growth has been essentially neutral to our net interest income.", "The increased deposits provide us with many opportunities to meet other financial needs of our deposit customers and if the loan demand we have in the fourth quarter continues, we can better redeploy our quarter strong deposit growth to foreign loan growth.", "As shown on page 11, tax equivalent net interest income was essentially flat from the third quarter with 3% growth in average earning assets. The 10-basis point linked quarter decline in the net interest margin was driven by three primary factors.", "First, our strong deposit growth caused cash and short-term investments to increase reducing the margin by eight basis points. Second five basis points of the margin pressure was driven by the ongoing repricing of the balance sheet in the current low rate environment and the fact that we were cautious in our reinvestment activity.", "However, as rates rose late in the fourth quarter, we did purchase approximately $5 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities and as rates rose again last week, we purchased another $5 billion of agency MBS. These declines were partially offset by the benefit of three basis points of higher variable income.", "As you\u2019ve heard me say frequently, our focus is on growing net interest income over time. The chart at the bottom of this page shows that even though the net interest margin declined 18 basis points in 2012, compared with 2011, we were able to grow net interest income by $472 million. Growing our net interest income remains our focus and we believe we can continue to generate growth even in this low-rate environment.", "Non-interest income increased 16% from a year ago and was up $754 million, or 7% from the third quarter. This growth was broad-based and included strong equity gains, as I highlighted earlier but also reflected strong business momentum across the company with deposit service charges up 3% due to product pricing changes, trust and investment fees were up 8% primarily due to stronger investment banking and retail brokerage asset-based fees, and other fees were up 9% on higher investment banking advisory activity.", "Mortgage banking revenue increased $261 million or 9% from the third quarter, with higher servicing and origination fees. Net servicing income was up $53 million reflecting higher net MSR head results, which were partially offset by higher unreimbursed foreclosure costs. Mortgage gain on sale revenue was up $208 million from the third quarter despite approximately $340 million in forgone revenue from retaining $9.7 billion of conforming mortgage loans, which I\u2019d mentioned earlier.", "The revenue impact was higher this quarter than last quarter as margins widened overall and more of our retained production came from the retail channel which is a wider margin business. Third quarter results included a $379 million provision for mortgage repurchase losses, which was $83 million lower than the third quarter.", "Mortgage originations were $125 billion in the fourth quarter, down $14 billion from the third quarter, reflecting normal seasonality and the elimination of our wholesale channel, which originated $8 billion of loans in the third quarter. 12% of our origination volume this quarter was from HARP. The unclosed mortgage pipeline at quarter end was $81 billion, up 13% from a year ago and we would expect to benefit from seasonally stronger applications in the first quarter.", "Turning to expenses on page 13, fourth quarter expenses increased $784 million from the third quarter due to the higher operating losses from the independent foreclosure review settlement and the $250 million foundation contribution that I mentioned earlier on the call. Even with these items, our expense efficiency ratio of 58.8% was within our targeted range of 55% to 59% and if you adjust for our noteworthy revenue and expense items this quarter our ratio was actually at the lower end of this range. However we believe expenses will remain elevated in the first quarter due to seasonally higher personnel expenses as we have every year. ", "Our efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter was 190 basis points lower than a year ago. While we have made progress in improving our efficiency, we believe our expenses are still too high and we will continue to focus on opportunities to reduce expenses that do not impact our ability to grow revenue. For example, since 2008 we reduced the size of our overall real estate occupancy portfolio by over 16 million square feet net of growth. Over 4.5 million square feet of this reduction occurred in 2012. ", "We continue to see opportunities to reposition our real estate holdings in the next few years, and we are experiencing more than 20% higher efficiency in the construction of all new office projects using improved design and build-out standards. ", "When looking at our results it\u2019s also important to consider that some of our costs are elevated because of the current environment. We highlight some of these costs on slide 14. They totaled approximately $790 million in the fourth quarter alone. The OCC consent order added approximately $125 million of expenses in the fourth quarter and roughly $500 million of total expenses during 2012. The settlement that was reached earlier this week with our regulators will allow us to significantly reduce both the external and internal costs in the first quarter and fully eliminate these costs by the second-quarter. ", "In the fourth quarter we had $221 million of foreclosed asset expense, which totaled $1.1 billion for the full year. The improvement in the housing market will reduce these expenses over time. We also have higher costs that reduced mortgage banking revenue. We added $313 million in the fourth quarter and $1.7 billion during 2012 to our repurchase reserve not related to current originations. ", "Servicing fees were reduced by $127 million in the fourth quarter and $677 million during 2012 to reflect higher cost of service and unreimbursed foreclosure costs as foreclosure timelines continue to extend. In addition, we had a total of $2.2 billion of operating losses in 2012, almost $1 billion higher than the amount we had in 2011 as we resolved many significant matters related to our mortgage business. ", "Turning to our segment results starting on page 15, community banking earned $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, up 14% from a year ago and up 5% from the third quarter. Retail banking achieved a record cross-sell of 6.05 products per household, up from 5.93 a year ago. Our credit card business continues to grow with credit card balances up 4% linked quarter to a record $24.6 million with a record $12.6 billion of purchase dollar volume in the fourth quarter. This growth reflects seasonal holiday spending and strong account growth. ", "New consumer credit card accounts grew 11% from fourth quarter of 2011 with household penetration increasing to 33%, up from 29% a year ago. We remain focused on meeting the needs of our small business customers with business checking accounts up 3.7% from a year ago, and we extended $16 billion of net new loan commitments to small businesses across the U.S. in 2012, up over 30% from year ago.", "Wholesale Banking earned record net income of $2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 24% from a year ago and up 2% from the third quarter. Wholesale Banking continued to have solid deposit growth and as I mentioned earlier, they also had strong loan growth that was broadly diversified and gained momentum late in the quarter with period-end balances increasing $8 billion or 3% from the third quarter. ", "Wholesale Banking has generated nine consecutive quarters of loan growth. In addition to meeting the financing needs of our commercial customers, we continue to better serve all of their financial needs is reflected in Wholesale Banking cross-sell growing to 6.8 products, up from 6.5 products a year ago.", "We\u2019ve seen better penetration across our diversified product line, including strong growth in investment banking, with investment banking fees from commercial and corporate banking customers up 30% in 2012 versus 2011, and strong sales of our industry-leading treasury management products, including -- increasing treasury management revenue by 13% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago.", "Additionally, commercial credit card purchase volume increased 25% in the fourth quarter from a year ago reflecting strong account growth and increase usage among existing customers.", "Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned a record $351 million, up 4% from the third quarter and up 13% from a year ago. The year-over-year growth was especially strong considering that fourth quarter 2011 included $153 million gain on the sale of H.D. Vest.", "Earnings continued to benefit from higher asset-based fees with WBR client assets up 7% from a year ago, including strong growth in average core deposits up 6% and retail brokerage managed account assets up $50 billion or 20% driven by strong net flows and market performance.", "In addition, WBR continue to effectively partner with retail banking to meet all the financial needs of our customers increasing cross-sell to 10.27 products per household up from 10.05 a year ago.", "Turning to credit quality on page 18, trends continue to show improvement with fourth quarter net charge-offs of 1.05% of average loans. Net charge-offs were impacted by the completion of the implementation of the regulatory guidance issued by the OCC at the end of the third quarter, which increased our net charge-offs by $321 million in the fourth quarter. Excluding this impact net charge-offs were 89 basis points of average loans, 47 basis points lower than a year ago.", "Reflecting continued improved credit performance and also incorporating estimated losses attributable to Hurricane Sandy. We released $250 million in loan loss reserves in the fourth quarter. Absent significant deterioration in the economy we continue to expect future reserve releases in 2013, but a lower level than 2012.", "Nonperforming assets decreased $744 million from the third quarter and were down $1.5 billion from a year ago. Loans 90 days or more past due decreased $57 million from the third quarter and were down $613 million from a year ago. Early stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also declined from the third quarter a year ago.", "Our servicing portfolio continued to perform better than the industry with our delinquency and foreclosure rate over 400 basis points lower than the industry average, excluding Wells Fargo, based on the most recent publicly available data.", "Our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 7.04% in the fourth quarter, down from 7.96% a year ago. We added $379 million to our repurchase reserve this quarter, down $83 million from the third quarter. Our repurchase reserve balance increased to $2.2 billion up 9% from third quarter. Our repurchase reserve incorporates current demand levels considers all vintages and anticipates probable future expected demands.", "The unpaid principal balance of outstanding repurchase demands were down 3% from third quarter, reflecting a lower level of new demands from both the GSEs and private investors.", "As shown on page 21, our capital levels continue to increase with our Tier 1 common equity ratio growing to 10.12%, up 66 basis points from a year ago and up 20 basis points from the third quarter. Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III capital proposals increased to 8.18% in the fourth quarter.", "We purchased 42 million shares in the fourth quarter and entered into a forward repurchase transaction for an estimated 5.9 million shares that is expected to settle in first quarter. During 2012, we purchase a total of approximately 120 million shares at an average price of $32.35.", "We remain committed to returning to more capital to our shareholders. Our 2013 capital plan that we submitted to our regulators last week requests an increase in capital distribution to shareholders as compared to our 2012. But remember, our request is subject to Fed review and non-objection. ", "As I\u2019ve highlighted, 2012 was an outstanding year for Wells Fargo. We generated growth throughout our businesses, we reduced risk, including lower credit losses, and we increased our returns. However we\u2019re even more optimistic about all the opportunities that we have in 2013 to continue to benefit from our business momentum and slowly improving economy. We remain focused on reducing expenses and we believe we have further opportunities to improve our efficiency ratio, and we should benefit from reduced environmental costs in 2013. ", "We are optimistic that loan growth can\u2019t continue in 2013 and we believe we will be able to grow net interest income even if rates remain low. We have opportunities throughout our consumer and commercial businesses to continue to grow market share and increase cross sell.", "And now I\u2019ll open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Tim, I was wondering on the share count. In 2012 the share count was flat despite about 4 billion of share repurchases. Just kind of wondering what\u2019s the strategy with regard to share count. Is it to just offset, use buyback to offset employee issuance or to really steadily reduce the net shares outstanding?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, you\u2019re absolutely right John. This last year in terms of our total purchases that\u2019s what we\u2019re able to accomplish to keep shares about flat. We\u2019re hopeful that over time as we continue to return more capital to shareholders that we will have the ability to increase the amount of shares that we can repurchase. But that\u2019s subject to the capital plan that we just submitted. So over the long-term we would like to do better than what we did this year. ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And in terms of the gross issuance, was there anything unusually high by your issuance this year or was 2012 kind of normal year for employee issuance?", "Tim Sloan", "I would say it\u2019s -- it was a relatively normal year. As you know having our team members received some of their compensation based upon on the shares is really important to make sure that the team members and shareholders are very aligned in terms of the long-term growth of the company. ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "And then on expenses, should the look-back expenses start to come out immediately beginning in the first-quarter, those are gone?", "Tim Sloan", "I wouldn\u2019t assume that they would be completely gone in the first quarter. There\u2019s going to be some clean up this month and maybe trailing into next. They will clearly come down materially, I don\u2019t know what the exact number is going to be. They will be completely out of the run rate in the second quarter. ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "And on the mortgage side, as originations come down if that happens in 2013, how quickly can the mortgage expenses come out?", "Tim Sloan", "We\u2019ve got some good track record in doing that and our mortgage folks have seen cycles before. You saw what we were able to accomplish in 2011 in the second quarter and then also in 2010. There is a bit of a lag, so I would say there\u2019s about 60 to 90 day lag, so call it a one quarter lag but we can move pretty quickly. ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay and then one thing on the margin, on the five basis point of pressure that you attributed to rates and spreads coming out. Should we assume that, that pace continues for that piece? There\u2019s obviously moving parts in the net interest margin but for that piece of it does that hold at that kind of five basis point pressure?", "Tim Sloan", "John, I wish I could give you a guarantee of what specifically the impact will be. It does seem to have moderated a bit but it\u2019s really a function of all the mix of loan growth and also of securities purchasers. But it seems like it\u2019s moderating a bit.", "John Stumpf", "And remember John, we\u2019ve been pretty thoughtful about reinvesting but we saw some opportunities late in the year that is still shuttling. And we also saw great loan growth in the fourth quarter. So all those things have an impact. ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "And those MBS balances you mentioned may gain towards the end of the fourth and into the first quarter. Tim, those are funded with the cash balances, right? They\u2019re only earning about 25 basis points a year, increasing the yield there, right?", "Tim Sloan", "That\u2019s correct. But it was 16.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. 16 that you\u2019ve done so far.", "John Stumpf", "No, no. I\u2019m talking about 16 basis points.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "On the yield. Okay.", "John Stumpf", "In terms of deposit cost.", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, John.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Erika Penala - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Hi Erika.", "Erika Penala - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Hi. My first question is on the excess liquidity. I guess, from the first part, of the $27 billion in average growth escrow that you saw this quarter, how much of that do you think is sticky and if you think most of that is sticky, I appreciate the commentary you made about, if loan growth continues at this pace, you can absorb some of that liquidity but that still leaves you with some excess. Could you give us a sense of what your deployment strategy is going to be for the next year?", "Tim Sloan", "Erika, you raised a really good point and that is we did see very outsized deposit growth and the fact of the matter is that a good portion of that deposit growth came toward the end of the quarter. And whenever that happens, we want to be careful to watch that deposit growth overtime to make sure that we do think it is sticky.", "What\u2019s interesting is that notwithstanding that we\u2019ve had periods like this over the last couple of years, one in point would be the third quarter of 2011. But that deposit growth has been maintained here. So we\u2019re optimistic that we can maintain a good portion of that deposit growth. My guess is we probably -- it maybe difficult to maintain all of it.", "And so it creates a real opportunity for us because the way that we think about deposit growth is not just to fund our loan growth or fund investments. It\u2019s broadening the relationships and bringing new relationships into the company and so that gives us an opportunity not only to invest and increase, spread income over time but to be able to broaden those relationships so that we can grow fee income, which is really what you saw this quarter.", "We saw broad-based fee growth and the way that we think about that fee growth this quarter is reflective of all the deposit growth that we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years, which has been pretty exciting.", "", "John Stumpf", "Let me add to that Erika, first of all we feel no urgency to have to put something to work that might not be economic for us. We had excess liquidity last summer. And today MBSes are 30, 40, 50 basis points richer or higher yield. And as Tim mentioned, virtually all these deposits are part of our relationships. We\u2019re here to serve customers and these deposits, I think, we\u2019re moving share today.", "And this is going to benefit this company for years and years and years to come and a lot of that revenue does sharpen the non-interest income side. If you think back four years ago, we had about $650 billion of non-CD deposits in this company. Today we have $950 billion. I mean, yeah there has been periods of faster growth, slow growth but we\u2019re moving share and I can be happy about this.", "Erika Penala - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Understood. And my second question, if I could, is a follow-up to John\u2019s. Again, we appreciate the comment on the first quarter with regards to the seasonality in pay as well as some of the $125 million is still going to linger in the run rate. But if we think about the second quarter, and I take $12.9 billion that you posted, take out IFR settlement of $644 million, the charitable contribution of $250 million and take out $125 million.", "Is $11.8 billion a good sort of run rate based for your second quarter. Obviously, there are moving parts. You mentioned the mortgage production-related expenses and investment in the franchise. But is $11.8 billion a good starting point for the second quarter?", "Tim Sloan", "Erika, the math that you just did is reasonable. However, I don\u2019t know what our expense run rate is going to be in the second quarter. What I do know is that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on reducing expenses and improving our expense efficiency ratio.", "If revenues are up, I would expect expenses to be a little bit higher and that\u2019s a good thing. As long as we\u2019re delivering those, our revenues at a reasonable return and seeing an improvement in the expense efficiency ratio. But again we\u2019ve been very clear we still believe that our expenses are too high. But we\u2019re focused on improving the expense efficiency ratio as opposed to providing the target in terms of the hard dollar costs in any quarter. ", "John Stumpf", "Tim is absolutely right. We\u2019re not going to be slavish any absolute number. But as Tim mentioned the take-away tooth burns. Expenses are still too high. We\u2019re focused on that. And I would love to see expenses go up if it\u2019s appended to increased revenues. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "On the servicing side of the house if people are generally somewhat concerned about volatility in the -- on the origination income. But I noticed that your annual kind of servicing fees for kind of clipping the coupons are close to $1 billion and yet your net income -- your net revenue that your report is about $250 million, it was $200 million last quarter. So all the market value and hedging costs, are that number in between, can you talk a little bit what could -- might get so that you could report kind of a cleaner number there? What has to happen in terms of the level of refis, is it a change in rates because you\u2019ve got -- you\u2019ve had a backup in rates in the last few weeks. So just talk about that a little bit?", "John Stumpf", "Sure, Moshe. That\u2019s a good question. I think when you look at the results in 2012 you saw a number of things that occurred in terms of the servicing income. I think one, which we called out is just the higher level of unreimbursed expenses related to lengthening the foreclosure timelines and foreclosure costs. As we talked about we will review those as being environmental which is why we called them out. I can\u2019t promise you how quickly they will come down but our guess is they will come down and there will be less -- over time there\u2019ll be less of an impact on the value of servicing.", "The other phenomena that you saw and it occurred to a greater extent in the first quarter and into to a lesser extent this quarter was our assumptions around the discount rate. We had a discount rate change in the first quarter, we had a small discount rate change related to access servicing in the fourth quarter that impacted the number by about $53 million. And again we\u2019re hopeful that we don\u2019t see those kinds of discount changes over time. ", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Just kind of on a unrelated topic, you mentioned the growth of deposits you are seeing and service charges, has there been any kind of pricing either from you and your competitors, pricing changes in the service charge area that are worth noting?", "John Stumpf", "One of the initiatives that we have had over the last year is to simplify our checking account -- accounts and also to make sure that we were being paid appropriately for the services that we provide. So we\u2019ve repriced the checking account base this year in the company and that\u2019s been an initiative in our retail banking group and notwithstanding that they\u2019ve been able to grow deposits and over the year grow accounts.", "Tim Sloan", "There\u2019s not much change in the competitive landscape. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ed Najarian with ISI Group.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group", "So I guess my margin questions were sort of asked already but one more quick question. You outlined that you had $11.9 billion of unrealized gains in the securities portfolio. Now that we\u2019re in a Basel III world and that accounting has capital on a B3 basis. Is there any desire or anything being done to try to protect that against a rising rate environment or how do you think about that in terms of capital and the desire to protect it?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, it\u2019s two ways to think about it. It\u2019s a good question and of course you know how much we enjoyed talking about the NIM. So any additional questions are terrific. But the way that we think about it is that we look at the underlying risk return for any security and we do that every day for our entire portfolio. And so you really need to start looking at that on a security by security basis. And there are certainly days when we look at some of our investments and we decide that it makes sense to go ahead and sell. But remember that we think about that -- the -- that portfolio, the AFS portfolio as a longer term investment portfolio. So you don\u2019t really see a lot of sales, it tends to be a little bit of the exception, because again we\u2019ve invested those for the long-term.", "I think in terms of the potential capital impact, you\u2019re absolutely right, it does take, it is going to be a potential impact and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we think it\u2019s prudent to have a cushion in addition to the minimum 8% Tier 1 common equity under Basel III estimates that we\u2019ve talked about now since Investor Day.", "And we\u2019re making a lot of progress in terms of growing our Tier 1 common equity 8.18%, so we are going to be at 9%, hopefully in the next year or so. But again that\u2019s another reason to have a question. But I wouldn\u2019t look to us try to monetize that $11.9 billion, because we think we\u2019re getting the good risk return on the spread income for those investments.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group", "And you wouldn\u2019t do anything necessarily from a hedging standpoint above and beyond what you\u2019ve historically done to try to protect that?", "Tim Sloan", "No. I don\u2019t I think that that would make sense because and what you\u2019d have is you have an asset that\u2019s generating income that\u2019s not mark-to-market and versus hedge that\u2019s potentially marked. And that creates a mismatch in, the industry that\u2019s created problems and that\u2019s just not how we think about it.", "John Stumpf", "And as a -- as if rates do backed up, there is a whole bunch of other things that happen with the company, I mean, actually earnings increased with your margin. So it might not be quarter-to-quarter and that\u2019s why Tim about, that\u2019s why we are going to an extra buffer, but if rates back up that would be a good thing for us. We love that.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group", "Right. Right.", "John Stumpf", "\u2026 for the right reason, because economy is getting better and so forth.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group", "Okay. And then just one quick follow-up, I take it from your answers to John and Erika\u2019s questions that, you\u2019re not feeling any special urgency to get the excess liquidity here reinvested. It sounds like, when you talked about some additional security -- securities purchases in the beginning of this quarter, but it sounds like you\u2019re going to take your time and sort of judge your rate environment, and invest that excess liquidity more over time than right away, is that the way to think about it?", "Tim Sloan", "That\u2019s absolutely right. It gives us great flexibility in terms of running the company, so you\u2019re spot on.", "John Stumpf", "That\u2019s right, Ed. We think that\u2019s a real benefit of the company.", "Ed Najarian - ISI Group", "Okay. All right. Great. Thanks guy. Appreciate it.", "Tim Sloan", "Thanks Ed.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "John Stumpf", "Hi, Joe.", "Tim Sloan", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "The C&I growth was much stronger in the fourth quarter, so it looks like the fiscal cliff concerns really didn\u2019t dampen customer demand much. What were some of the key drivers to the increased volumes this quarter, was there any increased line utilization and just how do you feel about the outlook for C&I growth in the year ahead?", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah. Joe, just a quick answer on line utilization, it was up slightly, but it wasn\u2019t a primary driver. Actually was kind of interesting because the fiscal cliff negotiations and the potential for increases and changes in tax rates actually had slightly positive effect on loan growth in the fourth quarter, particularly toward -- on the commercial side and particularly toward the end of the quarter, so there was some amount of growth related to some of our customers taking actions and so on and so forth.", "But when you look at the growth within Wholesale Banking, it was pretty broad based. Our middle market lending business grew, our commercial real estate business grew, corporate banking grew, asset-backed finance grew.", "So we were very pleased with the performance and again, it just creates an opportunity to broaden relationships particularly with new customers. But it was very broad based and I would say that fiscal cliff was a net positive to loan growth.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. So it sounds like you feel pretty good about the sustainability of this momentum going forward there?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, there is going to -- there\u2019s always some seasonality, I should have mentioned that, I apologize. There is some seasonality, there could be -- we could see a bit of that fall off in the first quarter if that was primarily related to the fiscal cliff.", "But we feel confident that we can continue to grow our loans in Wholesale. As we mentioned we have been able to do that for a number of quarters and we\u2019ve been able to do that for a number of quarters in many of the Wholesale Businesses.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Then my other question was just, if you could just talk little bit more about your reaction to the new qualified mortgage rules announced yesterday by the CFPB and just how might that effect your origination volumes going forward?", "John Stumpf", "Yeah. Joe, I -- as I mentioned in my comments, I think that CFPB found the right balance and listened to a variety of constituencies or people who they employ. And I think regarding the QM, it\u2019s going to provide -- it provides its broad, it provides clarity and I think it\u2019s going to help more Americans get more credit and that\u2019s good for housing, good for America. ", "Well, let\u2019s step back a second. That\u2019s not the old issue that you need to be sold for. We still have the GACs out there. We have FHA seminar issues. We have the QRM that need to be decided. You have issues around states of their own things, new services. There is a whole bunch of other things going on here but this is a positive move.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "A couple questions, one on the purchase reserves and one just general. So on the purchase reserves I know you indicated that you\u2019re making a reserve for old vintages. And we hear from other institutions they\u2019re just making the reserve for vintages that have been requested by the agencies. So I am wondering if you have been requested by more vintages than you\u2019re hearing your peers are or if you\u2019re just taking current requests and applying it to everything that you\u2019ve got?", "John Stumpf", "A good question particularly with a lot of the noise in the market. Our reserving process is the same as it\u2019s always been. There is really nothing new this quarter relative to any other quarter and that is we reserve for all probable and current future demands from all vintages, all vintages. It\u2019s based on all the conversations we have, all the documents we receive. So it really hasn\u2019t changed, we take into consideration any of the conversations we\u2019ve had with the agencies and we feel very good about the reserve that we have today", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And you are making some increase to the reserve even today, so conversations obviously change over time and you just take those conversations reflect against vintages. Is that fair?", "John Stumpf", "That\u2019s correct, Betsy. That\u2019s absolutely right. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And then secondly on just the loan loss reserves we had some commentary from FASB about proposal for moving to life of loan reserving. And I guess I am not sure I am understanding your first take on that, how you think that would impact your reserve process and the levels and if you could tie it into your comment do you think that the reserving -- the reserve release is likely to slow in \u201813 versus \u201812?", "Tim Sloan", "Let me take the last part of your question first. The primary driver in terms of why we think the reserve release will probably slow this year is that we\u2019re seeing a -- while we continue to see improvement and reduction in loan losses is improving at a slower rate than it was a year ago and two years ago, still seeing improvement. That\u2019s great. In addition we\u2019re seeing a growth in the loan portfolio. So we think we\u2019re going to see reserve releases but the expectations that it will be a little bit less than what we saw or it will be less than what we saw in \u201813. ", "In terms of the Fed\u2019s discussions again that\u2019s a real work in progress right now. It\u2019s something that is probably going to take a few years to determine -- it will probably increase our reserving level, it will probably be more of a one-time increase, and then you\u2019ll see reserve on a current basis probably come down. But again I don\u2019t want to speculate too much on that because it\u2019s still a work in process, but I think it would be -- likely to be one-time reset for the industry and then the new world will potentially be lower reserves on a current basis. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Are there any loan categories today that you are doing a form of life of loan reserving or would all -- your loan category need to be -- ", "Tim Sloan", "No, for us it would impact all of the loan categories. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Did I hear you correctly when you were going through the balance sheet growth that you\u2019re not going to grow your residential portfolio anymore, did I hear that correctly?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes and no, let me clarify, Paul. What we -- we\u2019ve been very clear to call out the amount of first conforming first mortgage production that we otherwise would sell in a quarter and we did $9.8 billion of that in the third quarter and then we had $9.7 billion of that in the fourth quarter and then there will be another $2 billion to $3 billion from fourth quarter production that will close in January.", "Okay. That\u2019s conforming first mortgage production. But what we will continue to do is we will continue to hold all of our non-conforming or jumbo mortgage production on balance sheet and I think our growth in the fourth quarter was about $4 billion. And we like that business, such a great business for us.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "And of the $125 billion, just to clarify that you produced in the quarter, does that $9.7 billion come out of that $125 billion and you sold roughly $115 billion. Is that correct?", "Tim Sloan", "No. That doesn\u2019t. The $125 billion is what we sold.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. So you produced close to $135 billion to $140 billion?", "Tim Sloan", "No, no. I\u2019m sorry, Paul. I misspoke. I apologize. The 125 billion includes the $9.7 billion.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "So we\u2019re trying to create -- okay, so we\u2019re trying to back into a gain on sale margin. We should back out that 9.7 billion?", "Tim Sloan", "That\u2019s correct.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. And then you talked about that, that about $9 billion of the decline in the pipeline was from exiting the brokerage channel. Have you made any other -- did you tighten up the corresponding channel at all as that? I know you said you\u2019re not going to expand the channel anymore. Have you tightened it up?", "Tim Sloan", "No. And again it was $8 billion of production that we had in the wholesale channel in the third quarter that we didn\u2019t have in the fourth quarter because we exited that channel by the end of the third quarter. But the corresponded channels still a very important part of our origination that we did not tighten up underwriting standards for the corresponded channel.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. And the pipeline channel was down roughly 20%. Was that also due to the exit of the brokerage channel?", "Tim Sloan", "By a small amount, yeah. I would just describe the decline in the pipeline as much seasonal as anything else. It\u2019s still -- and we ended the quarter with one of the strongest pipelines that we\u2019ve ever had in our history. So we\u2019re very excited in terms of how we\u2019re entering the first quarter.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "And then just to clarifying other comment. You did say that you expect production in the first quarter to be greater than the fourth quarter for mortgage production?", "Tim Sloan", "No. Not necessarily.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. I\u2019m not going to ask you then?", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah. No, no not necessarily. Just we start the quarter with a higher pipeline then we did a year ago.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. I understood.", "John Stumpf", "But Paul, we\u2019re still excited about the mortgage business. We still think it\u2019s lots of opportunity there?", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "And then, I don\u2019t know if you guys -- can you guys make any comments about the gain on sale margins. Is the profitability in mortgage banking holding up despite the fact that we\u2019re seeing rates go up 10, 20 basis points last week or so two weeks ago?", "John Stumpf", "Yeah. It has. In fact, our gain on sale in the fourth quarter was 2.56% versus 2.21% in the third quarter. So they were up in the quarter. Again these are very high levels. We\u2019re very pleased to have these gains but they -- and so because they are high, the likelihood is they could come down a bit. But it\u2019s a very, very good business right now.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Well, I was wondering -- I mean, as of today, we got two weeks under our belt and we\u2019ve seen the -- because of the fiscal cliff, the fiscal cliff agreement that came out that they backed, the 10 years backed up that 20 basis points. But ongoing operability in these mortgages are still -- haven\u2019t really backed of at all for the first couple of weeks of the year.", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah. A fair question. I haven\u2019t looked over the last couple of weeks in terms of what the profitability -- last week, what the probability in terms of loans we brought in, in the last week. But it\u2019s profitable right now.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. Hey guys. Thank you very -- go ahead. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "However, the volumes of the spring season typically the better sell season, so your purchase money, there is still lot of activity in the mortgage business.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. Hey, guys. Thank you very much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Hey, Matt.", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Two unrelated questions. First, when we look at your wholesale borrowings, so I just confess, I\u2019m thinking about short-term borrowings, long-term debt, foreign deposits, things like that. I mean, I realize some or little bit longer term than others. I\u2019m curious why we haven\u2019t seen those buckets come down when you\u2019ve had all the strong deposit growth?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, remember the strong deposit growth that we had in the fourth quarter was just in the fourth quarter. In fact, in the fourth quarter you saw our long term debt decline a bit and the way that we think about our long term debt levels today is that they are about where they need to be. And so much of what you will see us -- what you saw us do last year is just replacement. We still think it\u2019s appropriate to have a certain level of long term debt, that\u2019s very important in terms of our long term debt ratings. So it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019re going to see a big decline in that this year. ", "John Stumpf", "But Matt, if you go back four years ago look at our numbers, I think we had something over $4 billion of short and long-term debt, now it\u2019s down to a combined 180 or something like that. So over time it has come down as we\u2019ve grown deposits. We think some debt to maintain our ratings and support the balance sheet is important. ", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "And as you think about the other buckets outside of long-term debt, short-term borrowings, foreign deposits, are those at appropriate levels, I guess I thought that instead of growing the liquidity you would just bring that down (inaudible) just the OpEx or the NIM would it under so much pressure from adding from the Fed fund?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, the foreign deposits we have are from customers. So candidly I hope those deposits are going to grow over time. In terms of short-term borrowings you could see a slight decline in our short-term borrowings because of the increase in deposits. ", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "But I guess the overall message is like as we think about the liability side of things, there is not a lot of levers to pull from a mix point of view, like you\u2019ve done a lot of what you can do\u2026", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah I guess I would say the following. First, we still have about $2 billion, $2.5 billion of troughs that will likely come off the balance sheet this quarter, early second-quarter. And then I do think that if you look at the costs of our long-term debt even as it\u2019s staying -- coming down a little bit but staying the same you\u2019re seeing us make progress in terms of reducing the long-term debt costs just because when you look at the rate environment today versus when we originated some of our long-term debt, it\u2019s just lower today. ", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "And then just separate topic, as we think about progression of legacy mortgages it\u2019s a big picture like first you\u2019re dealing -- the industry is dealing with some reserve build and actual charge-offs and there have been a lot of various servicing related agreements with the state attorney general, OCC, the Fed, are we -- it feels like we\u2019re pretty -- and of course with all the put backs on the servicing, it feels like we are pretty far along on the servicing side or is there another round or two like outside of servicing that we should be aware of or will you wrap it up some of these remaining servicing issue, do you think a lot of the legacy mortgage costs go away?", "Tim Sloan", "Here\u2019s what I think about that, we went through this country especially with housing industry its really difficult period. You would expect that your litigation costs, all those sort of things will be elevated during that period. You\u2019re right, we put a lot of stuff behind us, some of that is inherent to the business, as the business gets better I\u2019d expect less of that but I\u2019m pleased with how much we\u2019ve gotten through with a lot of that behind us. ", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "But I guess just it\u2019s somebody who is not has involved in this, as lot of the folks on the call, well calling and say oh, I thought the bank settled on this last year and obviously it\u2019s different people or different constituencies coming in on the servicing side, whether it\u2019s the actual investors or I guess the politicians or the regulator, are there avenues that any other folks would take like maybe on the origination side or just kind of other skeleton on the closet that we might be seeing?", "John Stumpf", "Well, I mentioned in my comments that we\u2019ve settled the origination and servicing and we [settled lookback], we settled a variety of things. So I can predict what\u2019s all going to come up but I can tell you I am pleased that with this far through the process, we\u2019ve gotten a lot of big things behind us. ", "Tim Sloan", "And Matt, I would just note that even as we\u2019ve had to be a part of these settlements and they clearly had a financial cost to the company, throughout that entire period we\u2019ve generated record earnings.", "John Stumpf", "12 quarters in a row it\u2019s been a very difficult period of time, that\u2019s just talks about the diversity in earnings power of this company.", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah. Absolutely. Fair point. And obviously a lot of your expenses relate either you have them lower than some.", "John Stumpf", "And also look at the performance of our portfolio. I mean, 400 basis points better than the average for the industry is and that\u2019s ultimately the opportunity decide on these things in many cases.", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Tim Sloan", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.", "Fred Cannon - KBW", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much. Most of my questions have been answered. I just had a couple follow-ups. One on the qualified mortgage, John, you were generally positive about the direction. There has been some concern about the jumbo market and some of the press report has said that the qualified mortgage about 20% of -- more of jumbo loans currently been made might not be able to be made as qualified mortgages. I wonder if you could comments a little more specifically about the jumbo market?", "John Stumpf", "I think it\u2019s early yet to comment, because I\u2019ve not read in detail more of our people had enough time to really understand everything that\u2019s in the CFPB\u2019s Q. But let me just say this about the jumbo market.", "We loved that business. We\u2019ve been it for a long time. In many cases these are best customers and we do a lot of other things with them. So I doubt at least I\u2019d be surprised, if whatever happened there would have a big negative impact on the jumbo market.", "Fred Cannon - KBW", "Okay. One of the 804 pages like, that\u2019s understandable not to get through it, yeah.", "John Stumpf", "More than the 600.", "Fred Cannon - KBW", "I wonder but John on the expenses and I know you guys are doing, focus on operating leverage. Within your expense controls, I wonder if you could comment about your thoughts about your branch network at this point in time in terms of both -- within kind of thinking about managing expenses about both the numbers of branches, but also the configuration of kind of the footprint of your current branches, especially given and where technology is today?", "John Stumpf", "Sure. Couple of things there, first of all, I think, we have the best team on the plan running our distribution. And I couldn\u2019t be happier about the 6,000 or so stores that we have and stores still today remain incredibly important in the overall distribution community. Even though online, especially tablet, the so called lean-back technology is changing the industry.", "Most customers choose their first financial services provider based on proximity to where they live and we have a store within 2 miles of half the American population. It\u2019s a huge advantage.", "But we used to build 5,000 square foot stores with a 10 penny sign. Now we\u2019re building 10 penny stores with a 5,000 square foot sign. It\u2019s more important because if customers come there and then use other technologies, they want to be able to go and say, that\u2019s where my money is, that\u2019s where I can go if there is an issue, that\u2019s where I go if I have a big transaction to do. So, stores still remain an incredibly important part of the ecosystem of delivery.", "That might change over time and the tablet or the smartphone is changing the way customers do business with us. They are on with us much more. They are learning more and we\u2019re doing, have all kinds of experiments and test going on, paperless stores and more self-service.", "But and change is not new to us. I mean we\u2019ve been -- we had at one time in this company one service model. It was a stage coach and that went away after a few years and we have tried something else, so this is -- I find this exciting.", "Fred Cannon - KBW", "So I would be fair to say, John, that, what, the numbers of branches could even drift up from here, but the square footage will probably be coming down?", "John Stumpf", "Yeah. That could be. Actually the most important thing and you probably know this, in distribution is distribution density. People want distribution, where they live, work, recreate, travel and so forth, that is and we are gaining retail share faster today we have in my 35 years or 30 years with the company.", "So it\u2019s a -- but distribution -- physical distribution remains a critical part of it. But size is the way you staff it, the number of people and all of that sure that needs to evolve. And it is evolving. But we\u2019re not in the camp that you can circulate the greatness.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies & Company.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "The one further on the environmental expenses, we understand, were the content order -- 125 should be out of the run rate by the second, and Tim, to your point about being 800 million now still on a quarterly run rate. I was just wondering you could kind of give us just a general understand of the rest of it, the 675 that you\u2019re still carrying. What\u2019s the tail-off of that as we go ahead, and the biggest one being -- are we closer to the end of the putback reserve build?", "Tim Sloan", "I wish I knew the answer to -- specific answer to the question, Ken, because it\u2019s a real good one. It\u2019s one that we think about a lot around here. Maybe just to give you a sense of some of the magnitude, if you look back in the fourth quarter of 2011 our foreclosed asset expenses were $390 million, they were 221 this quarter that was down from the third-quarter, down from the second-quarter. So you\u2019re seeing those costs, for example, come down quarter by quarter and not necessarily by a lot but that will never go down to zero but certainly we can continue to make progress on that.", "As it relates to our repurchase reserve build, I think that the biggest mistake anybody in this industry can make is predict when that\u2019s going to end because we just don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve been fortunate over the last that we peaked in the second-quarter and we\u2019ve seen a decline in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, can\u2019t promise you whether that\u2019s going to continue but at some point we will be through all the vintages we will have all the conversations and will be done. But I don\u2019t know the pace at which that can continue. So I\u2019d love to give you a specific number, but I just don\u2019t know, we just do believe that they\u2019re going to be coming down over time. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been seeing over the last few quarters. ", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "And then my second one is the gain on sale question question again on the mix, it being up 30 basis points or so, how much of that was the market versus how much of that was the channel mix you had because of the lack of the wholesale product in the mix of origination?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, clearly some of it was related to channel mix because you think at the margin we didn\u2019t have any wholesale origination versus having more retail. I don\u2019t know what the exact impact that was on the margin, apologize we can follow up with that but the margin was up over 30 basis points quarter to quarter. So it was a combination of both.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "The important thing is that retail generally comes with at a higher margin rate, so we shouldn\u2019t necessarily look at it that is inappropriate, right?", "Tim Sloan", "No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inappropriate, that\u2019s the gain on sale margin, there\u2019s also higher costs and expenses associated with the two. But it\u2019s a very, very good thing from our perspective. ", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "My last one is just on the non-controlling interest, it didn\u2019t change on the balance sheet but it was doubled the amount there normally is, it\u2019s actually extra $0.02 that you paid out this quarter. Any color you can provide us on that?", "Tim Sloan", "That was directly attributable to the gains that we had in the private equity business that we mentioned, so in our equity gains and so that\u2019s really an offset to that. We didn\u2019t necessarily feel like we had to offset that when we called out that impact. But you\u2019re right, that\u2019s actually [de duck] to the net of impact. ", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "That\u2019s incremental to the number that you showed us in the press release?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, that\u2019s correct. ", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "The bottom line is that it shouldn\u2019t be at that level going forward because it was specific to the sale of the business. ", "Tim Sloan", "Correct, unless we have -- if we have more gains -- the gains are a good thing, right but that\u2019s what we would -- that\u2019s correct, it\u2019s d doc to us. ", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "And then my last tiny one, is just on the -- on the putback question, the reserve addition of the provision was 379, can you tell us what the actual losses were this quarter?", "Tim Sloan", "Hold on, I will get that number in a second. It\u2019s in -- $206 million.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "$206 million. Okay. Great. Thanks very much guys appreciate it.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.", "Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Hey, Chris.", "Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer", "Hi. Given the Becker Underwood gain this is a good quarter, I ask you about a business you do not get to talk about that often which is the venture capital business. I know it\u2019s been magnificent contributors since the Norwest days, but looking at your disclosures, at year-end, it looked like you had about a $1.4 billion invested in VC fund of various types at September about a $1.3 billion. And you had $1.5 billion of gains there this year and I\u2019m wondering are you still able to invest in that fund in the venture capital business? Are you still making new investments or does the Volcker Rule kind of put this into liquidation mode.", "John Stumpf", "That\u2019s a really good question. I think, our best guess of the impact that we are going to see from the Volcker Rule and again I want to be careful because Volcker Rule has not been finalized yet, is that it would eliminate or/and our ability to invest in a private equity fund or real estate opportunity fund as a limited partner. That seems pretty clear that that business would get eliminated or that activity would get eliminated as part of Volcker.", "However, we believe that we will continue to be able to invest and we continue to invest today in Norwest Venture Partners and Norwest Equity Partners, which we believe will be allowed under the Volcker Rule.", "Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer", "", "And those are your investments in those funds are what we see in page -- in your 10-Q, the $854 million and $83 million?", "John Stumpf", "Well, yes, but there\u2019s also still a legacy amount of equity investments that are related to limited partnership investment that we\u2019ve made over time or previously and those are going to come down over time. But again, we believe we will continue to be able to invest in NVP and NEP.", "Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Excellent. And then lastly, I guess, just not the NIM question, but in net interest income dollars question. And that\u2019s that it seems like since the first quarter of 2011 net interest income has been $10.8 billion plus or minus. I mean, you\u2019ve been holding it steady and loan growth has been like this quarter it was 1.3%.", "So, you\u2019ve had to run just to keep still and yet you said, you think expect net interest income dollars to start going up. And I guess what gives you the confidence that you know the treadmill that you\u2019re going to be able to run faster than the treadmill in the year ahead?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, I think it\u2019s a good analogy. It certainly has been a treadmill because our folks have been working very hard. But I think what gives us confidence is that\u2019s what we did when you compare 2012 to 2011. We grew net interest income dollars in this environment.", "John Stumpf", "Almost $0.5 billion.", "Tim Sloan", "Right. And so, we like it to be higher, you bet, we would. But I think we\u2019ve been able accomplish that, not necessarily on a sequential quarter basis each quarter, but year-over-year we\u2019ve been able to accomplish that with the headwinds that we all know we\u2019ve experienced in the net interest margin. So, I guess, we just look at it and say, we hope history repeats itself because we think we can do that.", "John Stumpf", "Our liquidating portfolio, we are getting closer and closer to the end of that because when we wake up in the morning, the first day of the quarter, we know historically $5 billion or $6 billion would shrink on that side, while it was $4.1 billion this last quarter. So we are going to work through that but the investments we are making, some of the on balance sheet, some of the loan growth, all of that helps. And also we have reduced liability cost 2 basis points across the Board. That\u2019s important.", "Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer", "All right. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Hey, Mike.", "Tim Sloan", "Hey, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "I have questions on the good, the bad and the ugly.", "John Stumpf", "I think you had last time. I think that\u2019s you had. You want to start with ugly first?", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Okay. I thought it was. Okay. I don\u2019t want to repeat myself too much. Let\u2019s start with the good. Page 26 of the supplement, the nonaccretable difference, I think the good news is, as you said, housing is doing a little bit better. So why do you still have $7 billion of non-accretable difference or 23% of the unpaid balance. What constraints you from recognizing more of that back to accretable yield?", "John Stumpf", "Well, the analysis that we do is done on a quarterly basis where we look at our expectation related to future loss, we look at the default rates, re-default rates and the like. And we make adjustments over time. You can see in the pages from supplemental we\u2019ve made adjustments over time. In fact, in the third quarter we increased -- we moved I think about 400, $500 million from non-accretable to accretable. and our expectation is over time is that if we believe that housing prices are going to -- if you believe that housing prices are going to continue to increase and we do that, that won\u2019t the last time that we would move non-accretable to accretable. It just didn\u2019t happen based upon our models in the fourth quarter. ", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "And also in the good category, just a general question, how much longer -- this question I did ask last time, how much long do you think this gain on sale margin will hold a much longer, we have more of a refi boom based on your own website 30 year conforming is now 3.6% and under 3.5 for most of last quarter. And you need to have some expectations and you guys have to plan on that, do we have one more quarter, two more quarters, two more years, what\u2019s your best guess?", "John Stumpf", "You know what I don\u2019t know for sure, but in the fourth quarter we provided some detail in terms of our servicing portfolio and we cut the portfolio, you can get this on the website. You can cut the portfolio based on note rate and then we also segmented by loan-to-value and we also segmented it by FICO score. And what you see there is there are hundreds of billions of dollars of opportunities, I am not publishing you that we get every one of those refinancing opportunities but there\u2019s hundreds of billions of dollars of refinancing opportunities that are just in our existing portfolio alone. So it doesn\u2019t feel like this is absent a big increase in rates that that this is going to be the last quarter that we\u2019re going to see good volume originations from our refinance activity. ", "So it could last a couple more quarters, sure it could last through the end of the year. Your guess is as good as mine but there is a lot of opportunity out there. We start the quarter with a very strong pipeline, one of the strongest pipelines in our history, so we feel confident and we\u2019re optimistic about continued originations in the mortgage business. ", "Tim Sloan", "Mike, think about this, the average rate in the portfolio, securities portfolio is 4.77% and the street rate is 3.25, 3.5, I don\u2019t know exactly where it is from day-to-day, but so on average there is at least a 100 basis point opportunity there, customers typically are using the money, they do that 50 basis points. Now it\u2019s going to be little more difficult, yet it is marketing and retail more important, absolutely, that\u2019s placed to us. We have the largest retail sales force, we have thousands of team members in our stores. We\u2019re talking to customers everyday and finding leads. So this is what we do. So again, I don\u2019t know how many quarters it\u2019s going to be. I don\u2019t know all that. But I am optimistic.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "And under the bad category, the loan utilization has not improved a whole lot. I guess you\u2019re saying it\u2019s good because you\u2019re moving market share, but why isn\u2019t loan utilization going up, why is it there\u2019s more demand from the customers?", "John Stumpf", "Most of our commercial customers, their balance sheets are strong as I have seen in years and years. They are sitting with tons of liquidity and cash flows. So what -- it\u2019s kind of logical that they would use our cash firstly they would borrow. But a good part of that whole story is we are growing in spite of that. The day will come when they will start to use those lines again. We\u2019ve already had all the embedded costs, just think what happens then. So I view this as kind of good, not a bad. ", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "And then the ugly, I know you don\u2019t call this as ugly, the last margin question. And you brought up that last year grew despite the margin and all that, but late quarter didn\u2019t look as good. Look if you core deposit pricing goes down by two basis points and your loan repricing goes down by five and your securities pricing goes down by 11. That\u2019s not a good formula. So when do you think that margin decline goes away?", "Tim Sloan", "You know what, if you tell me where rates are going to be on any scenario then I can give you a better idea. I don\u2019t know where rates are going to go, Mike. I think it\u2019s a very fair question, right.", "But the important thing, right, when you think about Wells Fargo is not to be overly focused on the net interest margin. We get half -- about half of our income through spread income. We get about half of our income through fee income. You saw diversified growth on the spread income side in terms of loans, the best that we had in a long time, right. More important -- as important, you saw diversified growth in fees.", "And so, sure we\u2019re on that the net interest margin is under pressure. But even in a quarter where the net interest margin was down 10 basis points. Again, mostly because of deposits what we think long-term is a great thing, in terms of growing that deposit growth, our net interest income was about flat, right. I view that as pretty strong performance in this environment.", "John Stumpf", "And I also suggest a lot of companies would kill for our margin. Feel pretty good. I mean, yeah, it\u2019s come down but for the all the reasons that Tim said, why would we turn away deposits from our customers. It -- we are not -- surely we look at the margin, surely we think about that, but we don\u2019t run a business according to it.", "So and I know we\u2019ve had this discussion many times. But for a company that can grow revenue 6% to 7% without any help really, much help from the -- from half of your revenue side that\u2019s a very strong company.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "All right. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Tim Sloan", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning, Marty.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "I want to follow-up on. Hey, I want to follow-up on one of the questions that your answer to Mike on the refinance activity. You brought up that the average rate is $4.75, the street rate is around $3.50. So half of your customers are still in a position where they should refinance?", "What are the two main reasons that are holding them up with all the HARP out there and all the other programs and initiatives, what helps to get those customers back in front of you and able to do the refinancing, at this point they really should be able to do?", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah. Marty, I don\u2019t know or wouldn\u2019t necessarily agree that it\u2019s half of the servicing customers. It\u2019s certainly a large portion. So if you think our servicing portfolio is about $1.9 trillion, I think, when you look at how we\u2019ve cut the servicing portfolio and some of the work that we did last quarter that we provided, I think, the numbers probably a quarter to maybe a third of the $1.9 trillion.", "What keeps some people as they are toward the end of the maturity of their loan and they look at it and say, you know what it doesn\u2019t make sense or they\u2019ve got other things to do or their loan -- their LTV might be high and it might, they might be -- they could, excuse me, they could apply for the HARP program and it takes a while to do that. So there is a lot reasons why folks do it. It\u2019s not because our team is not out there working very hard to try to help them refinance their loans.", "John Stumpf", "Yeah. I would also say that there has been so much volume coming that it\u2019s taken 90 days or it\u2019s been a long process. Now that we\u2019ve built up our team, we are looking more at. We can shorten that period of time which it takes to refinance is 60 days. So, I think, that\u2019s an advantage.", "But the real advantage is, we\u2019ve got this retail distribution, working together is, all our personal bankers and commercial bankers who look for these opportunities refer to a mortgage company, so that\u2019s really one of our strengths and how we are going to harvest this and serve these customers.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Okay. Staying on mortgage for a second, if you look at the hedging value at 67 basis points, we actually saw an uptick couple of basis points this quarter. As you\u2019re looking at rates now moving really in an upward direction at some pace in the future. What are you doing with your hedging, such that, you lightened the bite of the hedging negatives as rates go up and allow the value of the increased value and servicing as the extension of the life bringing some of that to the bottom line to help offset whatever, down draft you might see on the origination side.", "Tim Sloan", "We\u2019re not going to fundamentally change our hedging strategy. We don\u2019t want to think about the MSR as a way to speculate on interest rates, right. That\u2019s just not -- none of us around here are smart enough to know where interest rates are going to go. But we are pretty good at doing what our mortgage team is very good at doing. And that is putting a hedge in place that keeps the appropriate level of risk so that we can look at our servicing asset and generates the income based upon the fundamentals of the business as opposed to the direction of rates. ", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "And I guess instead of really betting on interest rate, there\u2019s almost like we\u2019re paying for insurance that you don\u2019t really need to have because further drops in interest rates are not as feasible as it will be before rates were higher?", "Tim Sloan", "Marty, that\u2019s a fair point except you know what if we were sitting here a year ago we might have said the same thing and then we would\u2019ve been wrong we would have a big loss in the MSR, we\u2019ve had to on hedge, and you could have said the same thing two years ago. So at some point you\u2019re going to be absolutely right, I just not and we\u2019re not smart enough to know exactly when that inflection point is going to be and we\u2019re just not going to use the MSR to speculate on rates. ", "John Stumpf", "This is a really good business and that\u2019s not making any sense for us. ", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "When you look at the asset quality and the net charge-offs dropping down to -- if you take the OCC impact of around 89 basis points. So we have gone from 130 in the fourth quarter last year to a little less than 90 basis points. That trend, you would think, as the underwriting and the lack of demand and the cleanup in the portfolio and run off of some of the more troubled portfolios or ones that have a little bit more pressure could really in a good time end up less than 75 basis points. Do you kind of see that migration over the next couple years?", "Tim Sloan", "I hope you\u2019re correct. I think we\u2019ve got to be a little bit careful because in some of our businesses we\u2019re already experiencing much less than typical loan losses, for example in the wholesale business. It\u2019s about as good as it is going to get. Now we could see a little bit of improvement but that part of the business we\u2019ve already seen a decline. The disproportionate share of our loan losses continue to come from the home equity portfolio, that portfolio continues to reduce in terms of overall size. ", "So we\u2019re hopeful that the loan-loss rate that we experienced in net or gross of the OCC guidance will continue to go down, whether or not we can get to 75 basis points only time\u2019s going to tell but we\u2019re clearly going in the right direction. ", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "And then last question, thanks for spending so much time, is you talked about the yield curve steepened at the end of the year that you started to go and hit some of those higher yields. What kind of critical level are you looking at in a sense that the yield curve can steepen as we saw much quicker than the Fed ever starts to tighten interest rate? As you start thinking about deploying liquidity, what are some of the levels that your [Alco] guidelines or thought process brings you to be a little more aggressive on the liquidity side?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, Marty, if you look back at where rates rose to right toward the end of year. So we think about the two inflection points that we saw was a few days to a week period as the fiscal cliff negotiations seemed to be going fairly well, that rates backed up pretty significantly and that was a good indication of some of the inflection points that we were looking at. And then likewise when the Fed minutes were released last week and it was a little bit of surprise in terms of the dissension or healthy conversations minutes, maybe that\u2019s a better way to describe it among the various our Fed governors, voters and not that rates rose again and we took an opportunity -- we took that opportunity to buy. So it\u2019s at those levels we feel are pretty attractive over a long-term basis. ", "John Stumpf", "Marty, we don\u2019t have any sad number that we say this is a number that which we will buy for the next 30 or 60 day or whatever. It\u2019s a very dynamic that are in process. We\u2019re looking, we\u2019re reading, we\u2019re thinking, we\u2019re -- so that\u2019s kind of how we go about this. And with the bias towards conservatism and making sure that we understand in the whole asset liability mix and so forth. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "One sort of universal question, it\u2019s applicable to you and I think it\u2019s applicable to the industry as well. Your ROE has improved to about 13%, which is one of the better ROEs in the industry. So, I guess, my question is how do we look at normalized ROE, not only for you, but for the rest of the industry? I mean, the 13% is good. It\u2019s below your historical levels. Is it desirable or is it possible to get back to those historical levels?", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah. That\u2019s a really good question. I think that fundamental to the question is just that when you look at the level of equity that the industry is going to have to hold in the next few years or beyond that is just higher than it was pre-crisis. So, I think, it\u2019s unlikely when you compare pre-crisis return on equity to post-crisis what we are experiencing now that we are going to get back to that high teens that even in some quarters low 20s returns on equity.", "Now, having said that, at our Investor Day we provided a range of return on equity between 12% and 15%, the reason we provided that range is that the level of economic activity and interest rates as we know can drive our return. So, our best guess is that in the current environment relatively slow growing economy that we\u2019re obviously making the best of that in lower rates, we think will be the middle to lower end of that range. If rates tick up and the economy starts to pick up a bit, we think we can be at the higher end of that range and hopefully get up to the mid-teens. Hopefully that helps.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "A question for you, John, I mean, the QM, I don\u2019t know, how it has come out relative to what the industry expected. But it\u2019s clearly going to keep some people out of mortgage market, who got into the mortgage market before. You expect that that now that we have the QM and you are going to be getting, I think, a higher quality customers resolve that the consumer groups are now going to start screaming about people being kept out of the mortgage market, who were getting mortgage loans before?", "John Stumpf", "No. It\u2019s hard to speculate or comment with any confidence on what others might see in it. I guess, I\u2019d just go back to couple of things. First of all, I don\u2019t know everything that\u2019s in the 800 and some pages. But what I do know about it, it solved a couple of issues I think are really important.", "It created a broad standard or we got as many loans as possible into the QM definition. And number two, there is good clarity around legal protections and risk and so forth. And there is also a debt to income or consumer debt or mortgage debt vis-\u00e0-vis income. So there are some bright lines.", "Hopefully, that will encourage more participants in the industry, more borrowers and I think that\u2019s all good. Now, whether in that -- but I don\u2019t think that alone will open up the floodgates of credit because all these other things went on that I had mentioned that are still unresolved, but I think this is a step in the right direction. I really do.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Okay. Thirdly, I would just ask you a question that could have been hanging around the Atlantic article which highlighted your accounting issues. This is not new. It\u2019s bringing up a lot of the issues that have been brought up before. Can you just give me your reaction to that and is there anything that you or anybody else in the industry can do to make some of these things like VIEs more transparent?", "John Stumpf", "First, let\u2019s talk about transparency. We want -- in fact this team is available to anyone of you and call us, we\u2019re not hearing these things from our investors. When I became CEO, we reinstituted or started the live call. We have the credit supplement.", "The company is a pretty plain vanilla in the way we operate the company. Yeah, there are -- there is levels one, twos and three assets in this but that doesn\u2019t make them less credible just that sometimes there is not market prices we can do. So we have to go through cash flows and establish values that way.", "I have never seen us to be more transparent. So if there is other things we can do, I\u2019m all ears for it. But I\u2019m not hearing that from investors and frankly I\u2019m not hearing that kind of commentary from most of the people including analysts that I talk to. But people are going to write what they want to write and they can make their own choices about where they invest their money.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning, John and Tim, happy New Year to you.", "John Stumpf", "Hey, happy New Year, Chris.", "Tim Sloan", "Happy New Year.", "Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus", "And Tim, I had a real quick question for you a follow up on the reserves. You mentioned that your reserve releases will be lower in \u201813 than \u201812, but they could still continue to some degree. If I back out the charge-offs from the OCC guidance related charge-offs in both third quarter and this quarter, because I think you guys have mentioned they were already reserved for. It looks like that you did under provide last quarter, provision was $200 million lower the net charge-offs. But this quarter if I backed them out your provision would be $70 million higher. So in essence have the reserve releases already ended?", "Tim Sloan", "No. Not at all.", "Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.", "Tim Sloan", "There are so many puts and takes that go into our reserve release -- our reserving methodology that ultimately than produces our reserve release or if you look back a few years of reserve bill, I wouldn\u2019t just focus on the impact of the OCC guidance as the primary driver for that, just a lot of puts and takes. And if we thought that the reserve releases had ended, we\u2019d say so.", "Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Is there any thought, I mean, you may have asked this before and I know it\u2019s a difficult question to answer, but with FASB and with the environment we are from a regulatory perspective and where reserves were heading into the crisis? Any thought of where reserve to loans in a range and up post re-regulation versus the financial crisis? If we were at one to one in a quarter pre-crisis are we up to $1.50 to $1.75 when all is said and done on a reserve to loan basis or is that still too difficult to us retain?", "Tim Sloan", "That\u2019s a really fair question and I wish we had a great answer for you, but there has been a lot of discussion and a lot of commentaries and jawboning from the regulators on this topic. So I would describe it as a work in process.", "We think that we\u2019re appropriately reserved and we are hopeful that overtime our reserves can come down as long as our portfolio -- the credit losses and the portfolio continues to improve which is what we\u2019ve been seeing.", "Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus", "All right. Well, thank you for the answer and good luck to you the rest of the year.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.", "John Stumpf", "Hey, Andrew.", "Tim Sloan", "Hi, Andrew.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Good morning, guys. How are you?", "John Stumpf", "Good.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "A couple of ticky-tack questions for you. First on the margins, this last quarter you went through a couple of items in terms of the cash build burden, in terms of the NIM impact and reprising. But then also there was variable sources benefited few basis points. What was that or what is that and how do we think about that? Is it seasonal one timer, how do we think about that?", "Tim Sloan", "I think that as we\u2019ve described variable it\u2019s a broad definition. The primary drivers this quarter for the variable income was higher fee income. So what that means is that when we have a loan we are -- and we charge a fee on a loan, that fee generally accrues over the life of the loan. When that loan is paid off early then we go ahead and recognize any of the unamortized portion of the loan fee.", "So, that was a primary driver this quarter. I wouldn\u2019t call it seasonal or one time. We see that from time to time within the business. Some quarters, it\u2019s higher, sometimes it\u2019s lower.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Got it. Was it about the same last quarter or was this quarter a little bit higher?", "John Stumpf", "I\u2019ll go back and look. I think it was a little bit higher this quarter. And again that\u2019s not a typical for -- in terms of the -- but the amount of the variation is not a typical to what we\u2019ve seen on a quarterly basis but it was a little bit higher.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Okay. Thanks. And then on asset quality and the reserve question, Chris I think just mentioned.", "John Stumpf", "Yeah.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "I wanted to ask more granularly on Hurricane Sandy implications you had mentioned it on the earlier comments in your release. How much of an impact was it really this quarter, was it in charge-offs, less reserve release, how do we think about it?", "John Stumpf", "It really wasn\u2019t in the absolute charge off number because it was -- we think about the timing of Hurricane Sandy. So, it was probably -- it was primarily in the reserve -- in the methodology that we use. We assume that we are going to have some additional losses in the future from Hurricane Sandy.", "So, we wanted to make sure that we were appropriately reserve which we believe we are based upon our best estimates right now. But as you can appreciate, we\u2019re very early into our true analysis or finalizing the analysis. It\u2019s going to take a while to see what the ultimate impact is. But we think there were appropriate reserve based upon some conservatism assumptions right now.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Can you quantify how much the impact was this quarter?", "John Stumpf", "I\u2019d rather not. It was any -- the reason I don\u2019t want to go into the specific details is because when you think about the reserving methodology, again there\u2019s lots of puts and takes. Some things go up, some things go down but just rest assured that we think we are appropriately reserved.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly on the tax rate, even adjusting for the settlement this quarter, it looks like -- the tax rate looks a little bit low 31% on an adjusted basis. How do we think -- is that lower than what it\u2019s been recently, is that a new kind of run rate or should we think about going back another 33%, 34% rate?", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah. What I would do -- that\u2019s a fair question. What I would do is go along the direction that you are and that is a back out the impact that we had in the fourth quarter and which is why we called that out, because we don\u2019t think 27% is sustainable. And then you get to that the number that you are talking about 31%, 32%. I think that 31%, 32%, 33% is a reasonable number. But it\u2019s more likely to go up a bit in 2013 and what we\u2019ve seen in 2012.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Jim Rowe", "Okay. Thanks very much everybody. We had a full set of discussions and we really appreciate your interest in Wells Fargo. Happy New Year again and we will see you at the end of the first quarter. Thank you again.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations.  Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.", "Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. ", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim, and thanks to everyone for joining us today.  In the first quarter, Wells Fargo generated another record quarter of earnings, and we achieved our 13th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth.  ", "We\u2019ve achieved these results by doing what we have always done: remaining focused and meeting the financial needs of our customers and helping them succeed financially.  We accomplished this in an environment that I think we would all agree wasn\u2019t ideal for generating earnings growth, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model.  ", "Our business is diverse in many ways.  We are geographically diverse, we have over 80 different businesses that performed differently in various economic environments, and our revenue is split fairly evenly between interest and noninterest income.", "That kind of diversity lowers risk and enhances earnings stability and growth.  Let me start by highlighting examples of our strong performance in the first quarter compared to a year ago.  We earned a record $5.2 billion, up 22%, and also grew our earnings per share by 23%.  We reduced our expenses and improved our efficiency ratio by 180 basis points to 58.3%.", "Our core loan portfolio grew by $50.9 billion, up 8%.  Our credit losses reflected the benefit of a slowly improving economy and the high quality loans we\u2019ve been originating over the past few years.  Our credit losses in the first quarter declined to 72 basis points, the lowest level since second quarter 2006, and our net chargeoffs were down 41% from a year ago.", "We also continued to benefit from our wonderful deposit franchise, growing deposits by $80 billion, up 9% from a year ago, while reducing total deposit costs by 5 basis points.", "Our growth reflects the benefit of our relationship model as demonstrated by achieving record retail banking cross-sell of 6.1 products per household.  We also grew wholesale banking cross-sell to 6.8 products and wealth brokerage retirement cross-sell increased to 10.3 products.", "We grew our return on assets, or ROA, by 18 basis points to 1.49%, and our return on equity increased by 145 basis points to 13.59%.  We continued to increase our capital levels, growing our estimated tier one common equity under Basel III to 8.39%.", "Returning more capital to our shareholders remains a priority, and we\u2019re extremely pleased that we were able to reward them in the first quarter by increasing our common dividend to $0.25 a share.  Our 2013 capital plan enables us to further increase our dividend rate to $0.30 a share in the second quarter, subject of course to board approval, and also increase our common stock repurchases in 2013 compared to our 2012 repurchase levels.  ", "We\u2019re obviously off to a great start in 2013, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the ability of our team members to continue to make more loans and grow deposits, increase cross-sell, and reduce expenses, all while we continue to invest in our franchise and adhere to our risk management discipline.", "Let me conclude by taking a moment to share my thoughts on some industry issues and our current view on housing.  A topic that has been in the headlines a lot lately that\u2019s important to Wells Fargo, our industry, and the economic recovery of our country, that is, Too Big to Fail.  ", "I believe our first priority as a country, given the economy\u2019s tepid growth, is restoring economic health to America, including consumers and businesses large and small.  Banks feel and support economic growth and we need banks of all shapes and sizes to serve the diverse needs of a diverse economy.  All banks add value, and big banks have unique resources and capabilities to help the economy, including coast-to-coast convenience, a broad range of products and services, and technology innovations serving large and small customers alike.", "There are ongoing discussions about the need for more regulation and other changes.  We do not need additional legislation aimed at big banks.  Important and significant regulatory changes have been made since the financial crisis, and we need to give existing regulations a chance to work, especially now, when all of our energy should be focused on creating growth and new jobs.", "No bank should be considered too big to fail and no taxpayer money should ever be used to support a failing institution.  Some claim that we receive a subsidy or have an unfair advantage from being perceived as Too Big to Fail.  We disagree.", "Wells Fargo supports economic growth in our country in a variety of ways, including employing 1 in 500 working Americans and paying more than $10 billion in corporate income taxes last year.  We are the nation\u2019s largest small business lender, and increased new loan commitments to small businesses by 24% in the first quarter compared with a year ago, and have grown loans to our middle-market customers for 11 consecutive quarters.  ", "We also funded 1 in 4 U.S. home mortgages in 2012, a total of over 2 million mortgage loans that helped our customers buy a home or refinance their existing home at much lower rates.  This is great for the overall economy, because housing has led almost every economic recovery in recent history.", "The momentum from the housing rebound during 2012 has remained strong in the early months of 2013.  Our near term outlook is for steady gains in home sales, building activity, and price appreciation.  Housing affordability remains excellent.  The overhang from unsold properties is gone, and demographics are favorable.", "Thank you again for joining us.  Tim Sloan, our chief financial officer, will now provide more details on our results this quarter.  Tim?", "", "Tim Sloan", "Thanks, John.  Good morning everyone.  My comments will follow the presentation included in the first half of our quarterly supplement, starting on page two, and then John and I will take your questions.", "Wells Fargo had another outstanding quarter, with record earnings of $5.2 billion, up 22% from a year ago and up 2% from the fourth quarter.  Earnings per share reached a record $0.92, up 23% from the first quarter last year.", "We have now achieved 13 consecutive quarters of earnings per share growth, and eight consecutive quarters of record EPS.  Quite an achievement given the environment during that period.", "Revenue was down this quarter, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter, a decline in equity gains from elevated we had in the fourth quarter, and the expected decline in mortgage volumes.  We were not surprised by these declines.  We had anticipated them, and we are very pleased with the strong fee growth we generated in a number of our other businesses.", "Our quarterly results also reflect lower expenses, strong credit performance, and increased capital levels.  As John highlighted, and as you can see on page three, we had year over year growth in pre-tax pre-provision profit, net income, EPS, both total and core loans, deposits, and a higher ROA and ROE.", "Slide four highlights that we\u2019ve been able to generate consistently strong results, through the diversity of our revenue.  We remain balanced between fee and spread income, and our sources of fee income are highly diversified.  Mortgage banking accounted for 26% of our fee income this quarter, and was 13% of our total revenue.", "We could not be more pleased with the performance of our mortgage business.  What may surprise some of you is that trust and investment fees accounted for 30% of our fee income in the first quarter, and has generated more fee income than any other category, including mortgage, for the past four quarters.", "We had strong year over year fee growth with a number of our businesses, with deposit service charges up 12%, brokerage up 12%, trusts and investment up 6%, investment banking up 37%, card fees up 13%, merchant processing fees up 23%, and mortgage servicing income of 25%.", "With over 80 businesses, they\u2019re not all going to grow every quarter.  We are excited about the market share and cross-sell growth we achieved this quarter across a number of our businesses.  The diversity of our revenue enables us to make the right long term decisions and be disciplined in managing risk.", "Overall, this was a pretty straightforward quarter from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, but let me highlight some key drivers to our results in the next two slides.  On page five, you can see we continued to have balance sheet growth this quarter, growing both loans and deposits.", "Even though we purchased a total of $17.8 billion in agency MBS in the quarter, our short term investments in Fed funds [sold] balance has increased by $6.5 billion as average deposits continue to grow.  ", "We grew our securities available for sale portfolio by $13 billion, up 5.5% from the fourth quarter.  This is our largest linked quarter increase since the fourth quarter of 2011.  We took advantage of the rate backup at various times within the quarter as rates rose and yields became more attractive.", "Turning to the income statement, on page six, I\u2019ve already highlighted some of the factors affecting the decline in revenue we had this quarter, and I\u2019ll talk about net interest income and noninterest income drivers in a minute.", "Noninterest expenses declined as expected, reflecting the elimination of elevated items we had last quarter and the addition of some seasonally higher benefit cost in the first quarter.  Our effective tax rate this quarter was 31.9%, which included the benefit associated with the realization for tax purposes of a previously written down investment.  We expect the full year effective tax rate to be higher, absent additional discrete benefits.  ", "Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail.  As shown on page seven, period end loans were up $33.5 billion, or 4%, from a year ago, and grew by $392 million from the fourth quarter.  Loan growth included the runoff of our liquidating portfolio, which declined $17.4 billion from a year ago and $3.7 billion from the fourth quarter.", "Excluding these liquidating loans, our core portfolio grew by $50.9 billion, or 8%, from a year ago, and was up $4.1 billion from the fourth quarter.  Our linked quarter loan growth was impacted by the very strong quarter end growth we had last quarter and the fact that we were able to retain and add to those loan balances is a real positive.", "Commercial loans grew $516 million in the quarter, on growth in foreign loans.  We saw declines in foreign loans throughout most of last year, and the growth we achieved this quarter was in trade finance, reflecting increased economic activity in Asia.", "Consumer loans declined $124 million, with growth in first mortgage and auto offset by declines in junior lien mortgages and expected seasonal declines in credit card and student lending.  The growth in first mortgage loans benefited from the retention of $3.4 billion of new conforming fixed rate production.  We currently do not plan to retain additional first mortgage production, although we have the flexibility to do so if conditions change.", "We continue to grow deposits in the first quarter, with period end deposits up $7.9 billion from the fourth quarter.  Average deposits were up $71.2 billion, or 8%, from a year ago and up $10.1 billion from the fourth quarter.  We also grew our primary consumer checking account customers by a net 2.1% from a year ago.  These are basically active customers who transact with us regularly.", "We continue to lower our deposit costs, with average deposit costs of 15 basis points in the first quarter, down 1 basis point from the fourth quarter and down 5 basis points from a year ago.  We\u2019ve successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit cost for nine consecutive quarters.  Our ability to lower deposit costs while consistently growing deposits reflects our longstanding relationship focus and pricing discipline.  ", "As shown on page nine, tax equivalent net interest income was down 2% from the fourth quarter, primarily due to two fewer days in the first quarter.  Without this day count impact, net interest income would have been essentially flat.", "Average earning assets grew $21.6 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting increases in short term investments, loans, and available for sale securities.  Our net interest margin declined by 8 basis points from the fourth quarter to 3.48%.  ", "This decline was driven by three primary factors.  First, our continued deposit growth caused cash and short-term investments to increase, reducing the margin by 3 basis points.  As I\u2019ve highlighted in the past, our deposit growth is obviously beneficial to deepening customer relationships and does not negatively impact net investment income, but it is dilutive to the NIM.  ", "Second, 3 basis points of the decline was due to the lower variable income, including PCI loan resolutions and periodic dividends.  Finally, 2 basis points of the margin pressure was driven by the ongoing repricing of the balance sheet in this low-rate environment, net of the growth in loans and AFS securities.  Growing net investment income remains our focus, which we believe we can grow even in this low-rate environment.  ", "Noninterest income was down from the fourth quarter on lower gains on equity investments, which were highlighted last quarter as being above average, and the expected decline in mortgage, which I\u2019ll highlight on the next slide.  ", "Because of the seasonality of many of our businesses and the lower day count in the first quarter, it\u2019s best to look at the year over year growth rates to demonstrate the momentum we\u2019ve had in many of our businesses.  Deposit service charges increased 12%, reflecting customer growth and product and pricing changes.  Brokerage fees and trust and investment management fees grew reflecting strong net asset flows and higher equity valuations.  Investment banking fees were up 37% from a year ago as we continue to do more business with our wholesale customers. Card fees were up 13%, with growth driven by strong new account growth and higher credit and debit card spend.  ", "On page 11, we highlight some mortgage trends.  While mortgage revenue was down this quarter as expected, we still had strong originations of $109 billion, our sixth consecutive quarter of more than $100 billion in originations.  Mortgage revenue was reduced by $112 million this quarter from the retention of $3.4 billion of conforming first mortgages.", "Gain on sale margins remained historically high, and as we\u2019ve been saying for the past few quarters, we would expect these margins to decline.  Origination volume for the rest of the year will obviously depend on continued strength in the housing market and interest rates, but we expect volumes to remain relatively strong given the improved purchase market and the benefit of the spring buying season.", "In fact, we\u2019ve already seen the improved purchase market benefitting our results with originations for home purchases up 31% this quarter compared with a year ago, and also many of our existing customers can still benefit from a refinance.", "We added $309 million to our repurchase reserve this quarter, down $70 million from the fourth quarter.  Our repurchase reserve balance increased to $2.3 billion.  Our repurchase reserve incorporates current demand levels, considers all vintages, and anticipates probable future expected demands.", "Our servicing portfolio continued to perform better than the industry.  Our total delinquency and foreclosure rate was 6.54% in the first quarter, down 50 basis points linked quarter and down from 6.89% a year ago.", "Turning to expenses, on page 12, first quarter expenses declined $496 million from the fourth quarter, which had included higher operating losses and a contribution to our foundation.  As expected, our first quarter expenses included $460 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401k matching, as well as $199 million in annual equity awards from retirement-eligible team members.", "In addition to lower operating losses and charitable contributions, we reduced expenses in a number of other areas including occupancy, outside professional services, contract services, and advertising and promotion.  We expect expenses to be lower in the second quarter, reflecting lower employee benefit expenses that were seasonally higher this quarter, but there will be normal growth in other areas, including ongoing investments in our business and normal merit increases.", "Our expense efficiency ratio of 58.3% was within our target range of 55% to 59%, and was down 180 basis points from a year ago.  We\u2019ve been focused on reducing expenses for years, as you can see in the impact on our results, but we still believe our expenses are too high, and we can continue to improve our efficiency ratio.  ", "Last quarter, we highlighted environmentally elevated cost, and we\u2019ve made progress in reducing these costs this quarter, as shown on slide 13, and we expect them to continue to decline.  We had approximately $50 million of continued costs from the independent foreclosure review this quarter, and these costs will be fully eliminated next quarter.", "Foreclosed asset expense was down $26 million from the fourth quarter, and down $109 million from a year ago, reflecting the improvement in the housing market, which we expect will continue.", "Mortgage revenue this quarter was reduced by $250 million for additions to our repurchasers reserve, not related to current originations, and was reduced by $58 million to reflect higher servicing and foreclosure costs as some foreclosure timelines continue to extend.  ", "Turning to our segment results, starting on page 14, community banking earned $2.9 billion in the first quarter, up 25% from a year ago and up 2% from the fourth quarter.  Retail banking achieved a record cross-sell of 6.1 products per household, up from 5.98 a year ago.  ", "To better meet our customers financial needs and improve cross-sell, we continually invest in our business, including new store designs, improved technology, and adding bankers.  We grew platform banker FTE by 1,528 from a year ago, and by 478 in just the first quarter alone.  ", "Our credit card business continued to have strong account growth, with a record of 577,000 new accounts in the first quarter, up 18% from a year ago and up 31% from the fourth quarter.  Our household penetration increased to 34.1%, up from 29.9% a year ago.  Credit card balances are down from the fourth quarter, reflecting normal seasonality, but are up 10% from a year ago, reflecting strong account growth.", "We also had continual momentum in our auto business and are now the industry\u2019s leading auto lender.  We generated record auto originations in the first quarter of $6.8 billion, up 10% from a year ago, and up 27% from the fourth quarter.", "We also successfully met the needs of our small business customers, with business checking accounts up 2.9% from a year ago.  We also extended $4.2 billion of net new loan commitments to small business customers this quarter, up 24% from a year ago.", "Wholesale banking earned record net income of $2 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from a year ago and up 1% from the fourth quarter.  Wholesale banking results continued to benefit from steady loan growth, with loans having grown for 10 consecutive quarters.", "Industry loan growth remains tepid, but our relationship focus has enabled us to grow market share, and we\u2019ve been able to generate middle-market loan growth for 11 consecutive quarters.  This growth has occurred as we maintained our pricing and risk discipline.", "Our risk and underwriting discipline is also reflected in the $8 million in loan loss recoveries in wholesale banking this quarter.  The last time wholesale was in a net recovery position was nearly seven years ago, in the second quarter of 2006.   ", "Asset management fees were up 8% from a year ago, and were up 2% from the fourth quarter.  Total assets under management increased $11.4 billion from the fourth quarter, with growth in all asset types.  The growth reflects the benefit from favorable markets and $4.1 billion of net inflows in the first quarter.", "Wholesale banking\u2019s continued focus on building relationships resulted in cross-sell of 6.8 products per relationship, up from 6.6 a year ago.

", "Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "My first question, John, is on your capital priority.  It\u2019s clear that the dividend is on top of the list, and your yield is clearly best in class.  However, I wonder how you think about weighing your buyback opportunities versus strategic opportunities for acquisition.  Because on one hand, most of your shareholders are clamoring for more buyback and to actually see shares outstanding, the count reduced, but on the other, there are not a lot of banks that have your currency.  So I guess if you could give us an insight into how you\u2019re thinking and weighing these issues.  And additionally, does the trajectory of mortgage have anything to do with favoring one strategy over the other?  ", "John Stumpf", "We have stated publicly, and I know you know this, that our payout ratio, we have targeted 50-65%.  I believe the first call in capital is to grow the business, and we have ample capital to do that and meet those payout targets.", "With respect to M&A, remember that the biggest users of capital on an M&A side would be in the deposit side of the franchise, of which of course we are at our federal statutory number, or close to it.  And the acquisitions that we have talked about being interested in would be mostly bolt-on businesses to our existing portfolio suite of the kind of 80 different businesses we do here, and predominantly in the United States.  ", "So we\u2019ve done some portfolios in the past.  We\u2019re still interested in things around wealth, help with retirement, but I don\u2019t see that as a huge draw on our capital.  This company is uniquely positioned that we\u2019re producing terrific returns in absolute terms, and in relative terms.  There\u2019s plenty of liquidity and performance there to meet a number of goals.  Again, investing in our business, doing strategic bolt-ons where they make sense, and returning capital to our shareholders at the kind of levels we\u2019ve talked about.", "Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ", "And my follow up question was for Tim.  Speaking of liquidity, I\u2019ve already gotten a few questions in my in box regarding how high your liquidity levels remain.  And obviously deposit growth continues to be strong.  But can you give us a sense in terms of why you\u2019re keeping it at this high of a ratio relative to your earning assets?  Is it you\u2019re afraid of the duration risk?  Does it speak to a question mark on the duration of deposit flows?  Or is it, as John alluded to, warehousing some cash in order to take advantage of some of the bolt-on opportunities that could be out there?   ", "Tim Sloan ", "That\u2019s a really good question, because our liquidity levels are low.  We view that as a real positive for the company.  Clearly the first call on our liquidity is always going to be for our customers, and we\u2019ve seen good loan growth year over year.  Our core loans are up $50 billion.  But even with that, as you point out, we\u2019ve seen very strong deposit growth.", "We did deploy some of that liquidity that wasn\u2019t need for loan growth in the first quarter at a slightly higher rate than what we\u2019ve seen in the last year, when we saw rates back up.  As you\u2019ll recall, we saw rates back up toward the end of the fourth quarter, and we purchased some securities.  They dipped back down and then they backed up again throughout the quarter, and we purchased $17.8 billion of MBS.", "Our plan continues to be to make the right long term decisions and the risk risk-adjusted decisions in terms of how we deploy our excess liquidity.  We don\u2019t want to significantly increase duration.  So our liquidity is up.  We view that as a positive, and we\u2019re looking forward to deploying it in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Now that you\u2019re starting to see a more sustained slowdown in mortgage applications, pipeline, and originations, how are you thinking about the headcount in this division?  And have you begun to address some of the variable costs there?", "John Stumpf ", "", "We actually added to the number of team members in the mortgage business in the fourth quarter, because we wanted to improve the customer service in the business.  And we\u2019ve seen a reduction in the time from app to close go from about 90 days to 60 days, which we view as a real positive and a competitive advantage.", "The mortgage business is still very strong.  At $109 billion, as we mentioned, it\u2019s our sixth consecutive quarter of originations above $100 billion.  And we started this quarter with a fairly strong pipeline at $74 billion on an absolute basis, and relative to almost most quarters we\u2019ve ever been in business.  ", "So the business continues to be strong, and as I mentioned, we also saw an increase in purchase activity in the first quarter, up 31% year over year.  I think the other positives in the business are we\u2019ve now seen an extension of the HARP program and with rates rallying again, we\u2019ve got more customers that could take advantage of a refinance, as well as the fact that as housing values go up, there would be more customers that could potentially take advantage of a refinance.  ", "So I think we\u2019re very bullish on the business.  That said, our expectation is that it\u2019s probably likely that revenues and margins will come down a little bit.  All that said, to the extent that it comes down further than we think, we\u2019ll adjust cost as or team has done through various cycles on a number of occasions.", "So that may happen this quarter, it may not.  I kind of hope it doesn\u2019t happen, because it means revenues will continue to be growing, so that will be nice.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets ", "I guess along those lines too, what about other opportunities to sustain origination volumes, just given some of the capacity issues you\u2019ve had in recent quarters?  Maybe perhaps more proactively marketing to tap into some of this pent up demand?", "Tim Sloan ", "I think that\u2019s a really good point, and the way that our team thinks about it, and one of the reasons we want to make sure that we\u2019re adequately staffed is that we do view the purchase market as a big opportunity, and so that as refinancing volume comes down, which it\u2019s come down over the last few quarters, we have our sales folks out there and our bankers out there being more proactive with our customers.", "John Stumpf ", "", "That\u2019s a great point, Tim.  This really plays to our strength, our One Wells Fargo, working as a team.  You know, we have 30,000-plus bankers in our stores.  Not every one of our customers who call us their bank has their mortgage with us, and we\u2019ve kept our relationships with our realtor friends and our builder friends during the big refi time, and this is really where it pays off.  And in Tim\u2019s comments, he mentioned that purchase volume is up 31% year over year, so that\u2019s really important for us.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.  ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit, Tim, on the factors that helped keep the mortgage gain on sale flat at very healthy levels this quarter?  And what will be the puts and takes on that going forward, if you have any outlook there?", "Tim Sloan  ", "Good question, because at 2.56%, it\u2019s historically high, and really right on top of what we saw in the fourth quarter.  Recall that our accounting convention is to recognize most of the gain on sale when we book the loan, and so the primary secondary spread changes in the quarter, and rate movements was really beneficial.", "I think in terms of outlook, let me throw some numbers at you, and then you can conclude what you think the right gain on sale margin might be.  If you look over the last four years, and I\u2019m going to use some yearly averages, the highest average we had was not surprisingly in 2012, which was 2.33%.  The lowest average that we had, which was in 2011, was 1.61%.", "And so when you step back and look at 2.56%, I think it\u2019s reasonable, as we said in the fourth quarter, to assume that the gain on sale is going to come down.  My guess is it will probably end up somewhere in the range of between 1.61% and 2.33%.  But I don\u2019t know exactly where it\u2019s going to be within that range.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ", "In terms of the mortgage put backs, at what point will you know it\u2019s okay to start using some of that reserve.  With the credit we could see when the inflows flow and you start to see chargeoffs come down and [unintelligible].  On the put back front, when do you start maybe consuming or stop needing to add to that reserve?", "Tim Sloan ", "Well, I hope it\u2019s sooner rather than later, and I don\u2019t know for sure, but when we think about our mortgage repurchase reserve, we not only look at what the current demands are, but also what expected demands are.  And so it has come down now for the last three or four quarters, which we\u2019re pleased with.  But we just haven\u2019t seen that yet.  We need to be very comfortable that not only current demands but also future expected demands are going to come down.  Hopefully it will be in the next few quarters.", "John Stumpf ", "You know, John, an improving housing market sure is a good sign regarding that issue.  It\u2019s not the only thing that influences it, but that\u2019s good news.  ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ", "And Tim, one quick follow up on the share count issue.  You know that shareholders are hoping to see the share count come down, and it hasn\u2019t yet, and we know in 2013 your plan involves more buybacks.  So I guess the question is does it also involve more issuance?  Or do you hope to kind of have the same issuance as you did last year such that your net share count would come down this year given that you\u2019ve done more buybacks?", "Tim Sloan ", "I certainly appreciate that share count is a big focus.  Candidly, earnings per share is a bigger focus for us, and we\u2019ve been pleased to be able to grow that for the last 13 quarters.  I think that when you think about the fact that last year we repurchased 120 million shares, the likelihood - again, this is a function of our share price that we repurchase shares at - the likelihood is that we will probably repurchase more shares than we did last year, and probably repurchase more shares than we issue.  And we\u2019ll know in a year.  ", "But again, our primary focus is going to be growing earnings per share.  But make no mistake, our capital plan calls for an increase in total share repurchase dollars versus what we did last year.  And we are going to be repurchasing our shares at a greater rate this year than last.  ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ", "And one quick follow up on, somebody said January, I think you said that in January you hope to grow net interest income dollars even though it\u2019s a tough environment and you\u2019ve got some pressure on spreads and things like that.  You\u2019re focused on the net interest income dollars, and you\u2019re having some earning asset growth.  I know in the first quarter you had day count pressuring the NII dollars, but do you still hope to grow that in 2013?", "Tim Sloan ", "Yes, we did.  I think that when you look at net interest income we could have had the same conversation a year ago and had the same concerns, and they would have been absolutely valid.  But last year we were able to grow our net interest income by over $500 million.  And our expectation is that we should be able to grow it this year.  Again, it\u2019s harder to see this quarter, because of the two fewer days, but if you step back and look at the last three quarters, you can see that notwithstanding the decline in net interest margin, that the net interest income has more or less bottomed at about $10.6 billion.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.  ", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Just following up on the net interest income dollar question, as you think about the relationship of balance sheet growth and the NIM percent, do we get an acceleration in the balance sheet growth?  Or do we get less NIM pressure to drive those dollars higher?  How would you envision that playing out?", "Tim Sloan ", "Well, recall that the primary driver for the decline in the net interest margin, just look over the last three years, 12 quarters.  The decline has been 79 basis points.  Almost three-quarters of that decline has been driven by the fact that deposits are growing.  Again, we view that as a very positive sign for the long term growth of the company.  When you pull that out, that net differential is really the decline in overall margin.  ", "So my bet is that if we see further net interest margin decline, it\u2019s probably more likely going to be driven by deposit growth than by margins.  But there\u2019s no question that the net interest margin in this interest rate environment, as the balance sheet reprices, continues to be under pressure.  But again, let me emphasize, we believe that we can grow net interest income just like we did last year, year over year, even in this environment.  ", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ", "And then separately, the chargeoffs came down sharply, and you commented both on the commercial piece and kind of broadly speaking on the consumer.  But the level that we\u2019re at on the real estate related areas in the consumer, is this kind of a clean level, or did some of the up-fronting of charge offs in the second half of last year related to regulatory changes, did that impact these numbers at all?", "Tim Sloan ", "No, and I wouldn\u2019t describe it as up fronting.  Clearly there was some OCC guidance that we had for a portion of the portfolio that we needed to address, and others in the industry addressed this.  I would view this as the charge off level and the credit performance as just being terrific.  And I don\u2019t believe that this is the bottom in terms of consumer loan losses.  ", "Again, the commercial losses are a little bit different story.  At 10 basis points, it doesn\u2019t take a lot of change to increase those or even decrease them a little bit.  But in terms of consumer loan losses at 123 basis points, our guess is that assuming the economy continues to improve, and assuming that we\u2019re going to continue to see an improvement in the residential housing market, which we think\u2019s going to happen, we should continue to see a decline.  ", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ", "And then just last clarification.  You talked about the tax rate bouncing up a little bit.  What number should we be using for the rest of the year?", "Tim Sloan ", "Well, I don\u2019t know what the number\u2019s going to be.  We just wanted to make sure that you all didn\u2019t use the tax rate in the first quarter and then just annualize it.  I think it will be closer to more historical levels that we\u2019ve seen in other quarters or other years where we haven\u2019t had some tax benefit like we had in the fourth quarter.", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ", "Okay, so maybe 32-33%, if I look at the last three years?", "Tim Sloan ", "Yeah, that\u2019s a reasonable range.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. ", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ", "You alluded the purchase mortgage market kind of stepping up, but isn\u2019t the scale kind of tough, just given how much of your originations are refis right now?  I guess if we look at, let\u2019s say, projections to the industry, how should we think about your market share and what that would mean for originations for the balance of the year?", "Tim Sloan  ", "I think you make a very fair point, and we didn\u2019t mean by pointing out that purchase money activity was up 31% year over year that that in and of itself is going to take the place of the decline in refinance volume.  Because as we\u2019ve said, and you\u2019ve seen in our numbers, that our total mortgage volumes are coming down.  I think what we\u2019re seeing is that they\u2019re not coming down maybe as fast as some folks might have thought, because of the improvement in the purchase money market.  ", "I think it\u2019s also factual that when you look at the market share that we have in the refinance market, it\u2019s higher because of the size of our servicing portfolio than it would be in the purchased money market, but again, that\u2019s why we want to make sure that we have more folks in the business being proactive with our customers so that we can grow our purchase money activity.  John, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment?", "John Stumpf ", "The way we think about this, we think this is a really important consumer product, and we have made investments in this business and have performed through a variety of cycles.  We happen to think now, yes, no question, that there will be less refinancing.  A lot of people have done their refinancing.  But even in that area, the average rate in our servicing portfolio is just shy of 4.7%.  The Street rate is, depending on the day, 100 basis points less than that.  So there is still refinance volume.  ", "But on the purchased money side, we\u2019re going into the stronger selling season now.  We have over 6,000 banking stores with bankers who are dealing with customers every day.  We have 10,000 plus home mortgage consultants out with their relationships.  And we will get our share, hopefully plus some.  And if it\u2019s not there, we can adjust quickly, because we have the experience, to bring our costs down and reflect that.  ", "But remember, housing is improving every day.  More people have more equity in their homes.  Americans have not lost their emotional attachment to home ownership.  It can\u2019t be for everyone, but we want to be there, help as many customers as we possibly can.  We like this business a lot. ", "Tim Sloan  ", "And Moshe, let me just give you a couple of other numbers to put it in perspective.  A year ago our pipeline, starting in the second quarter, was $79 billion, and now we\u2019re at $74 billion.  And 35% of that $74 billion pipeline is purchased money activity.  And that\u2019s an increase from about 24% a year ago.  So it is having some impact, which we\u2019re very excited about.", "John Stumpf ", "And the overall market, the overall purchase, still it\u2019s low by historical standards.  A normal market is a pretty good market for us.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse  ", "Two quick follow ups.  One is your correspondent share fell this quarter and JPMorgan reported today that the number two player there is moving up.  Can you talk about what your thought process is and maybe kind of related to the issue of whether you\u2019re thinking about selling either actual MSRs or a servicing strip, if that asset were to increase from here?", "Tim Sloan ", "The decline in share in the correspondent business, there wasn\u2019t anything in particular going on.  I think it\u2019s just a very competitive market.  But as it relates to the MSR, you probably saw this week that we did sell some reverse mortgage MSR.  ", "I wouldn\u2019t describe that as a strategic change in terms of our thought about the overall MSR.  That just reflects the fact that we got out of that business, originating those loans, a couple of years ago, and we thought it was prudent to continue to reduce our servicing activity in that business.  There\u2019s really been no change in our view of the MSR.  It\u2019s still an important asset for the company, and from time to time we may decide to sell, but again, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the sale of the reverse mortgage MSR. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets ", " ", "You know, I don\u2019t want to keep harping on the mortgage, but we saw yesterday that HARP got extended for two years, and I think you guys said publicly that you think the bulk of your HARP, you\u2019ve already originated or refinanced the bulk of your HARP.  Do you think that, if there is a good, solid PR program from the White House to get people off the sidelines, and the two year extension, do you think you could see another wave of HARP mortgages done?", "Tim Sloan ", "I don\u2019t know if it will be another wave.  Our HARP originations in the first quarter were 10%, which was down from the midteens that we saw last year.  I think this is a positive.  The HARP program has been a very successful program.  I think the numbers nationwide are over 2.2 million homeowners have been able to refinance via HARP.  So it\u2019s been a successful program.  I don\u2019t think it will be a new wave, but continuation is very good.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets ", "And then the follow up on the securities portfolio, was that actually being optimistic on the rates going up, because you feel rates are going to remain relatively flat?  Or is it something where when we see rates going up we could see the portfolio grow in that category?", "Tim Sloan", "I think if we see rates go up from here, you could see us being as active as we were in the first quarter.  We\u2019ve got a fairly, on a percentage basis, and also absolute levels, a pretty sizable backup in the first quarter.  If you\u2019ll recall, there were some days when the 10-year was above 220, and MBS was very attractive.  And from our perspective, given the amount of liquidity that we have, and given that we want to maintain a pretty steady duration and we don\u2019t want to take excessive credit risk, it just makes sense to take advantage of those opportunities.  We\u2019re not going to deploy all of it on one day, but again, given our liquidity, to be able to deploy $17.8 billion in the quarter on an opportunistic basis was very good from our perspective.", "John Stumpf ", "You know, as Tim mentioned, I think, in his comments, this is really, we think, a strength for the company, to have the kind of liquidity available.  And we make risk-return decisions every day.  And when we think it\u2019s favorable and in our shareholders\u2019 interest, we will deploy that.  And if we don\u2019t think the right risk-return ratio is there, we\u2019re willing to pass.  And we don\u2019t have to do something.  But this is a source of strength.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets ", "Does it surprise you guys a little bit, because I know it does me.  We\u2019re seeing the housing market start to pick up, we\u2019re seeing home builders building homes.  But there\u2019s still really not a lot of loan growth being created.  Do you see that changing over the next couple of quarters?", "Tim Sloan ", "Do you mean loan growth for home builders or for consumers?", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets ", "No, just for the overall economy.  I mean, that\u2019s one of the areas of activity we\u2019re seeing, but it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re materializing in the overall economy.", "Tim Sloan ", "Well, I wouldn\u2019t jump to any conclusions about loan growth in the industry in the first quarter.  If you look at the HA data, for the last few years the first quarter tends to be a seasonally low quarter, and what I would do, and again, this is just me, I\u2019d take the first quarter decline for the industry and also then add to that the fourth quarter that we saw last quarter increase and probably average those together.  And remember, the fourth quarter of last year was extremely high, because of some of the changes and decisions that folks were making because of the potential changes in taxes and the code and so on.  So again, I think what we\u2019re seeing in the industry is a steady loan growth if you average over the last few years at about one-ish percent on a quarterly basis.  We\u2019ve been fortunate because we\u2019ve been able to grow at a multiple of that.", "John Stumpf ", "", "If you look at some of the drivers, if you look at household formation, if you look at cost of financing, cost of housing, there\u2019s a lot of tailwinds, a lot of favorable attributes.  Now, nobody can predict what\u2019s going to happen, but if anything today there\u2019s probably a shortage of housing on the market.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.  ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Just on your last comment, shortage of housing in the market, that\u2019s a pretty powerful statement.  Is there any specific geographies that you\u2019re seeing that in?", "John Stumpf ", "It\u2019s not true in every market and at every price range, but when I\u2019m out talking with realtors and customers, the amount of supply, especially in the lower end or starter houses, there\u2019s not a lot of supply out there.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ", "", "Obviously that has some powerful implications for your business model over the next year or so, as long as we keep rates low.  And I guess that\u2019s kind of my question.  Do you feel like part of this housing improvement that we\u2019re seeing is a function of where rates are?  Clearly, at 3.7%, 3.3%, in that range, that\u2019s got to be fueling part of the boom here.  And to what degree are you building your business based on the current interest rate environment?  How do you protect yourself for the Fed deciding to stop QE3?  ", "John Stumpf ", "I would say the housing market is as much driven by confidence and by improvements in values as it is with rates.  I don\u2019t know of many people are on the sidelines and say, \u201cI\u2019ll only buy a house if the rate\u2019s 3.25%, and I won\u2019t buy at 4.25%.\u201d  I think it\u2019s about jobs, about confidence, about feeling good about where things are going.  Think about when you buy a house, it\u2019s what you make, what the house costs, and what your financing costs are that are the big three.  But housing is improving at different levels, but virtually everywhere we see in the country.", "Tim Sloan ", "And then the second part of your question, which is related to the interest rate risk and how do we protect ourselves, we\u2019re actually positioned very well over the medium and longer term to benefit from an increase in interest rates.  Again, as long as it\u2019s not such a large increase that it negatively affects economic growth.  But we\u2019re positioned very well, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why we continue to maintain the level of liquidity that we have.  ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ", "Great, and can I just follow up on one other thing?  I think you mentioned earlier on that you\u2019re not planning on retaining any more of the conventional production as you have over the last couple of quarters.  And I guess I\u2019m just wondering how you get to that decision.  Gain on sale coming down over the next couple of quarters, I would think it would tip in favor of retaining versus securitizing, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking of a broader range of inputs than that.  Maybe you can help us understand your logic.", "Tim Sloan ", "That\u2019s a good question.  Recall that the primary driver for the reason why we wanted to hold some of our first mortgage production in the third and fourth quarters of last year was because interest rates and investment alternatives, given the level of liquidity, were just very unattractive from our perspective, if you think about where rates were in almost all categories in the third quarter and the fourth quarter last year.  That\u2019s the primary driver, not necessarily the gain on sale margin.  ", "So as we looked at the first quarter, and we mentioned this last quarter, we saw the opportunity to invest because rates seemed like they were backing up and we took advantage of that rather than hold our first mortgage production.  So that\u2019s going to be the driver.  It\u2019s investment alternatives, not gain on sale margins.  ", "But certainly, if, for whatever reason, rates would really rally from here, and we could see a repeat of the third and the fourth quarter, we would reconsider holding some of those mortgages again.  That remains an option, and that\u2019s another strength of the business.", "John Stumpf ]", "Correct.  We don\u2019t preclude that.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ", "Yeah, because you did get it back up, obviously, in rates and [unintelligible].  So you\u2019ll be nimble is basically what you\u2019re saying.  ", "John Stumpf ", "Correct.  As nimble as we can be.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.  ", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Back to net interest income, and you said that\u2019s a focus, but at least linked quarter it stunk, and I know the day count, and you seem pretty confident that $10.6 billion is the bottom.  And I\u2019m just trying to figure out what would make you so confident.  Would it be anything to do with the accretable yield going forward, given better credit quality?  The balance sheet repricing?  Maybe [unintelligible] 2 basis points.  You feel better there?  Or is it just really just you added all these securities opportunistically and that will play out for a full quarter, and we should see that in the second quarter?", "Tim Sloan ", "Well, I\u2019m always careful not to disagree with you, but I wouldn\u2019t say that $10.4 billion of net interest income stunk.  I mean, it was down, but if you just added two extra days, and that\u2019s an issue with the calendar, it would have been $10.6 billion.  And we actually think, in the environment, when you look at the entire industry, that that was very good performance.  ", "But having said that, I think that the answer to your second question is it\u2019s all of the above.  We have consistently been able to grow our loans at a multiple of what the market\u2019s growing.  That\u2019s number one.  And number two, we\u2019re going to continue to take advantage and deploy our liquidity when we see rates back up like we did in the first quarter and we bought $17.8 billion worth of securities.  ", "And so again, we could have had the same conversation - I think we actually did - about a year ago, when we looked at where rates were, and where loan growth was.  The industry was coming off a seasonal low, just like it is this quarter.  And so our perspective is that we can grow net interest income and the next quarter we\u2019ll see if we were able to do it.  But that\u2019s our goal.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA ", "And of the securities that you put on, was that mostly the latter part of the quarter, the early part?  In other words, do we actually see it in the numbers?", "Tim Sloan ", "Yeah, that\u2019s a good question.  Recall that when we talked about our first quarter earnings, we gave some specific guidance that we had purchased some MBS at the end of December when rates backed up a fair amount.  And then you saw a rally again.  They backed up again in early January, and we were purchasers.  And then it kind of went back and forth a bit, and then we saw a nice backup about a month or so ago, and so we were pretty active, which is why the average was less than what the total purchases were.  And so you\u2019re going to see more of the benefit of those purchases as we go through this quarter.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA ", "Got it.  And then the second question relates to the efficiency target.  You are on the upper end of your target range, and there\u2019s the article today talking about your new mini branches.  And I know you\u2019ve talked about that in the past.  Now it seems like the execution phase.  Can you just give some sense of how many of your 6,000 branches might go to this mini form, if it\u2019s correct that they cost half as much, and any other color that you can give?", "John Stumpf ", "Sure, in fact, I was in Washington this last week, and went by and actually toured our first neighborhood store.  You think of it as a branch.  And it\u2019s a terrific combination of using technology and convenience, both for hours and after hours, so it really is a dual purpose that way.  ", "You know, our view around distribution is that it\u2019s more of a distribution community where you have stores and ATMs and online and mobile, and phones all working together.  And that\u2019s part of the magic of how we deepen, cross-sell, and how we build customer loyalty.  We don\u2019t have a plan per se that says so many of the neighborhood versus so many of traditional.  But they all work, because even our millennial customers who are much more skewed towards self-service and mobile devices still want and need stores.  ", "And in some places, you can\u2019t get a 3,000 or 4,000 square foot space, where 1,000 square feet works just as well, in fact better.  And so look for us to do more.  It\u2019s a test and learn kind of mode.  And it\u2019s going to help us grow and deepen the relationships.   ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.  ", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "My question kind of focuses on the operating expenses, and you talked about the seasonal impact.  If I kind of add those up, it\u2019s about $750 million in that number related to the seasonal uptick in first quarter.  That kind of starts to roll out as you move to the next quarter, but you mentioned the merit increase.  I didn\u2019t know how much.  If you could just give us some proportion of the $750 million that might get used up in the merit increase as you go to the second quarter.", "Tim Sloan ", "Oh, it could be a few hundred million dollars more.  I wouldn\u2019t take that $750 million and just deduct it and say that\u2019s going to be the second quarter.  We\u2019re going to have an impact for merit.  I think we\u2019re also going to continue to invest in both people as well as technology and products.  So we want to continue to grow the franchise.  So I wouldn\u2019t just deduct that and call that our expenses for the second quarter.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim ", "And then when you look at the net chargeoff rate dropping as significantly as it did, our provision number that you kind of came through with was pretty consistent with what we were expecting, but the composition was so different in the sense of net chargeoffs being lower, and release of a recapture of loan loss allowance being a lot less.  Did the lower net chargeoffs and improvement in nonperformers eventually start bleeding through in the recapture?  Or how do you kind of see that playing out in the sense of the magnitude going forward?", "Tim Sloan  ", "We\u2019ll, I think you make a fair point, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we reiterated that we do expect in the future to continue to see reserve releases absent some big deterioration in the economy.  So our expectation is that we will see more releases and again, it\u2019s going to be a function of the improving credit.  And we\u2019ve seen that now consistently.  I think one of the important things to remember is that our reserve release is a relatively small part of our total earnings.  I think it\u2019s less than 5% this quarter.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim ", "Exactly.  And lastly, I just wanted to ask you about, you know, a $74 billion pipeline.  Typically seasonally there\u2019s kind of a swoon in applications and activity, and that starts to pick back up as we get into spring and summer.  That would be kind of a pull through, that you could see originations still kind of hovering in the hundred billion dollar range given kind of your starting point is already three-fourths of the way there for the quarter.  Just thought I\u2019d ask your thoughts there.", "Tim Sloan ", "Well, Marty, I think you\u2019re correct in that the pipeline was very strong.  It was about what we saw a year ago at this time.  And again, I think that the complexion of the pipeline is a little bit different because a bigger percentage relates to purchased money activity.  I don\u2019t know what the originations are going to be for the quarter.  ", "I think the other thing to remember, and I referred to it, probably could have been a little bit clearer, and that is that we have an appropriate level of staffing to take advantage of opportunities out there in the mortgage business.  That\u2019s allowed us to reduce the application to close period from about 90 days to 60 days.  And so you can\u2019t really see that in the numbers, but that would portend some pretty good origination activity.  But in terms of what the number is going to be, we don\u2019t know for sure.   ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Greg Ketron with UBS.   ", "Greg Ketron - UBS", "A question on servicing.  I know you\u2019ve touched on this a number of different ways, but when you think about servicing going forward and where it\u2019s valued today, at around 70 basis points, if you just look at the residential side of it, and anticipate the rates do drift higher, if you have a slowdown of prepayment speeds, potentially you could see a pretty sizable writeup in MSR valuations, $5-6 billion if we got back to 100-110 basis points ultimately.  Would it be your anticipation that you would recognize most of that or hedge that away as that develops?  Could that be a future source of income in terms of running the balanced mortgage model?", "Tim Sloan  ", "It certainly could.  I don\u2019t know if I would necessarily agree with the $5-6 billion, but certainly we could see an increase in value of the servicing asset as rates go up.  I\u2019d also just want to make clear that as housing values go up, when you think about modeling that out, that also potentially has a negative impact on the servicing value because it\u2019s more likely that our customers could refinance as valuations go up.  So there\u2019s a little bit of a put and take there.", "But there\u2019s no question that one of the benefits of the balanced model is that when you\u2019ve got a servicing asset and rates go up, it becomes more valuable.  So that could be a source of earnings in the future.", "Greg Ketron - UBS ", "Okay, that stuff you wouldn\u2019t necessarily hedge away given the fact that you\u2019re in the balanced model?", "Tim Sloan ", "We want to make sure that we\u2019ve got the mortgage servicing asset appropriately hedged, and we\u2019re not going to speculate in interest rates in terms of how we hedge that asset, because we could just as well be right as wrong.  So my guess is that we will get some benefit, but it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re going to make a decision one morning to completely unhedged the portfolio because we think that rates are going to go up.  That would be a very, very bad decision.", "John Stumpf ", "Let me just reiterate what Tim said here.  Part of our balanced model is we don\u2019t speculate.  We don\u2019t try to speculate in this business around where we think interest rates are going to go.  We could have been sitting here a year ago and said they have to be going up.  And actually they went down.  So the balanced model is more around when rates are higher, we have more value in the servicing asset, and when rates are lower, we tend to do more gain on sale with production.  So surely those two are related to one another, but we\u2019re not in the business of taking a view on rates and then adjusting the hedge accordingly.", "Greg Ketron - UBS ", "And then John, a question for you.  At investor day last year you had spent time talking about the Wachovia franchise in the eastern U.S., and how you had the opportunity there, and as you achieved the record earnings and the positive growth and the revenues in areas such as wealth management.  Can you give us some color on how that\u2019s progressing, what kind of leverage you are receiving out of the Wachovia franchise at this point, and maybe percentage of the way through that optimization?", "John Stumpf ", "First of all, I want to tip my hat to all the team members who helped make that merger the best one I\u2019ve been around, and it was the largest, of course, in U.S. bank history.  And it\u2019s so rewarding to see the activity happening in the east with adding stores, adding team members in stores.  ", "In fact, if you look at productivity numbers, sales per day, referrals, cross-sell, the gap is closing rapidly.  In fact, some of the best innovations and ideas we\u2019re getting now for future growth come from our newest team members.  In fact, it\u2019s hard to distinguish east and west anymore.  It\u2019s quite pluralistic in its performance.  So it\u2019s hard for me to give a percentage.  I think we can get better across the franchise.  ", "But I just couldn\u2019t be happier with it.  And if I had to pick a percentage I\u2019d say, you know, well into the final quartile of performance closing.  It\u2019s just been that good.  And we continue to add people there, incidentally.   ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mustascio with KBW.  ", "Chris Mustascio - KBW", "I had a follow up on the MSR.  When you look at the MSR, and the black box accounting that goes around it, it certainly looks like, from a historical perspective, it\u2019s undervalued.  I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d get back to the 150 level of loan service relative to back in 2006.  But it certainly looks undervalued relative to historical perspectives.  And I know you had looked at it as a natural hedge or a partial hedge to production activity in a balanced approach.  ", "But what if that black box accounting creates a timing difference between when that asset is written up and when the production and gain on sale starts to fall?  If that occurs, would you consider more strategic sales of MSRs rather than the kind of nonstrategic sale of the reverse mortgage portfolio you just did, in order to harvest the gains that you can\u2019t harvest from an accounting perspective?", "Tim Sloan ", "Let me just push back a little bit in that we don\u2019t consider the accounting in and around the MSRs black box accounting.  We follow generally accepted accounting principles that are reviewed both internally and externally, and we think they\u2019re very sound.  I know there are some commentators that are out there that get confused by generally accepted accounting principles and think that they\u2019re hard to follow, but they\u2019re not.", "Having said that, I think the fundamental part of your question is that when we look at the servicing business, it\u2019s a really good business.  The servicing business has been so valuable for us over the last few years, but in particular it\u2019s been very valuable over the last couple of years because of the fact that it\u2019s put us in the position to be able to originate as many refinance opportunities as we have been, which has just been terrific.  ", "The capital implications of the MSR, given the new Basel III capital rules, creates an overlay over the asset itself in that it could be, in certain circumstances, a potential deduct to capital levels.  And that\u2019s just something that we need to take into consideration, and it\u2019s something we think a lot about.  And as we\u2019ve said, from time to time, it may make sense to consider selling some of the MSR.  We\u2019ve sold servicing in the past, we\u2019ve sold the reverse mortgage part of the reverse mortgage MSR this last week, which we were pleased with.  ", "So that could happen from time to time, but it doesn\u2019t change our view that the servicing business is a very important business for the company and is very valuable at all times, but in particular the period we\u2019ve been through.", "Chris Mustascio - KBW ", "", "Thanks.  I wasn\u2019t suggesting that you\u2019re performing black box accounting.  The point being that the yield on that portfolio being as low as it is, probably has never been lower, that the inherent value of that asset over time is certainly going to be higher than what\u2019s on the balance sheet today.", "Tim Sloan ", "Oh, completely agree.  Just wanted to clarify, that\u2019s all.  ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.  ", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research", "Just on the gain on sale outlook, I recognize correspondent is a lower gain on sale than retail.  But would you expect them to come down by about the same magnitude over the course of the cycle?  Or is one channel likely to outperform the other?", "Tim Sloan ", "I think if you looked at the gain on sale historically, it\u2019s been all over the place, on a comparative basis, between the two channels.  My best guess is they\u2019ll probably come down at the same level, but I don\u2019t know for sure.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research ", "And then just one follow up on kind of the general comments about housing improvement.  When we look at the pick-a-pay portfolio and where it\u2019s marked in the accretion, is there any kind of background you can give us on the home price assumptions embedded in that, or just more generally, if your positive view of housing comes to fruition, would the pick-a-pay portfolio perform based on the current schedule accretion?  Or does that represent upside to the current schedule of accretion?", "Tim Sloan ", "", "I think it represents some upside.  And we were very clear when we brought nonaccretable to accretable and updated the estimate of cash flows last year in the third quarter, that if we continued to see an improvement in not only the housing market but also in terms of the performance of the underlying asset, because that\u2019s a very important part of the valuation, that we could see some upside.  That didn\u2019t happen this quarter, but given the continued improvement, it certainly could over the next few quarters.", "John Stumpf ", "", "As I mentioned in my comments, we have a positive view, sure in the near term outlook, about steady gains in home sales, billing activity, and price appreciation.  We\u2019re seeing that in most of the markets, or frankly the lion\u2019s share of the markets.  And when that happens, good things happen here on all things related to real estate.  It\u2019s better for our home equity portfolio, for our reverse mortgage portfolio.  It\u2019s better for production activity at the mortgage company.  So surely things are improving.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research  ", "And lastly, just if I read it right, I think there was a sale of some of the PCI loans that kind of pulled forward the accretion.  With a rising market, would you continue to sell some of the PCI loans, or is that just a one-off?", "John Stumpf ", "", "We\u2019ll look at that opportunistically.  We had a $150 million gain from that.  We find opportunities.  We surely will do what we think makes most sense for our portfolio and for our stockholders.", "Tim Sloan ", "I think just to reinforce that, we marked this portfolio four years ago, and we just could not be more pleased with the performance.  And the expectations will change over time, but if there\u2019s an opportunity to pull through some of our forecasted accretion, we\u2019re going to go ahead and do that.  ", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "I just want to ask a bigger picture expense question.  A couple of the pieces have been asked, but Tim, you mentioned that expenses are still too high.  We know about the seasonality that can happen from first to second, and we know you\u2019ll make adjustments against the mortgage business.  So what I wanted to try to understand is when you say that expenses are still too high, what can you do to work on that underneath?  How much from [Project Compass] is still there to just recognize?  And then what areas are you actually investing in, and what\u2019s the magnitude of that investment versus what you can do to control things otherwise?", "Tim Sloan ", "", "Again, I think that the focus of the company is to improve our expense efficiency, and so when we say that expenses are too high, given the current level of revenue, we think that we can improve our efficiency, which is why we have that range of 55-59%.  ", "There\u2019s no one kind of magic change that we can make, that if we can just get through a certain project that it will get us down to 55%.  It\u2019s really a function of lots of projects all around the company.  It\u2019s improving the efficiency of our corporate properties and all of our square footage.  It\u2019s using technology to reduce cost in our businesses.  ", "And so sometimes there\u2019s some investment related to that.  It\u2019s continuing to make sure that our folks are all in the appropriate locations.  And it\u2019s little things.  There\u2019s literally hundreds of projects going on right now in the company such that we\u2019re focused on reducing cost.  So I\u2019d love to be able to give you two big items, but it\u2019s just not really the way it works, now that we\u2019re done with the integration.  ", "But I would also reinforce that apart and separate from the proactive projects that we have, the environmental costs are continuing to come down, so that we see, with an improving economy, particularly an improving residential mortgage business, that we could see continued improvement in our environmental costs apart and separate from anything else we\u2019re doing internally.  John, I don\u2019t know if you want to\u2026", "John Stumpf ", "I\u2019d add that we are making investments, and we want to continue to make those investments.  And we won\u2019t be, as I said before, slavish to anything here, because for example we\u2019re doing wonderful, innovative things to help customers on things mobile and tablet-wise.  We just talked a few minutes ago about our neighborhood store.  We\u2019re making investments, frankly, in compliance and governance, all kinds of different things.  ", "On the other hand, some things, just because you did it that way for 20 years doesn\u2019t mean you need to do it for the next 20 years.  And we\u2019re finding different ways to improve customer service, customer loyalty, deepening relationships, at the same time getting rid of expenses that don\u2019t add value.  ", "Tim mentioned a few seconds ago just space.  Four years ago, we had about 115-116 million square feet.  Now we\u2019re down to 95-98 million square feet.  It\u2019s down 10-12%.  And yet we have more people, more customers, more products, more services.  And I think that\u2019s the magic here.  We continue to invest, but we do all agree we can still do more.  And this is a bottoms-up exercise, and it\u2019s just part of doing business.  There\u2019s no destination here.  This is a journey.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company ", "An adjunct to that is then just a lot of the things you just mentioned, John, are very much about deepening relationships with customers and improving the experience.  Are there any parts of the investment cycle that are now also paying off on a clear incremental revenue side?  Because I think that\u2019s part of the investment process that people also want to appreciate too.  What are the investments that you\u2019re making that you\u2019re actively getting operating leverage off of?", "John Stumpf  ", "For example, adding more bankers in stores and getting referrals to the mortgage company.  Having ATMs that give paperless receipts.  Taking paper out of stores and not having to have as many Brink\u2019s pickups.  The way people can now buy products and services on their mobile devices and other self-service activities.  It\u2019s a number of things that help reinforce just when, where, and how people want to be serviced.  ", "There\u2019s actually a lot of innovation going on in the industry.  More of it happens to be within creating this distribution community, whether it be on the small business, large business, consumer side, as opposed to a different whiz bang kind of product.  It\u2019s much more about the overall service. and availability.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company ", "", "And then last tiny thing, just to follow up with Brian\u2019s last question.  When you mentioned the potential for nonaccretable differences to be moved back into accretable yield, is any of that potential in your outlook for improving NII this year?", "Tim Sloan ", "No, not really, because recall that in the third quarter of last year when we made the adjustment, and removed some of the nonaccretable to accretable, and also increased our expectation of cash flows, even though when you totaled it up it was over $4 billion in total, because the average life of the underlying loans is 12-plus years, the incremental increase in terms of net interest income or net interest margin in a given quarter is actually relatively small.  It will have some impact, but it\u2019s not a primary driver for why we think net interest income can go up in this environment.  ", "John Stumpf  ", "", "Thanks again.  We ran over a little here, but thank you for your interest in Wells Fargo, and for your questions.  We\u2019re always available to you, and we\u2019ll see you next quarter at the same time.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, Tim Sloan will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I'll now turn our call over to Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim. Thanks everyone for joining us today. Wells Fargo continued to demonstrate the benefit of our diversified business model generating record earnings in the third quarter and achieving our 15th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth. While the drivers of our earnings growth over this period have differed, reflecting the changing economic and interest rate environment, our focus on meeting our customers' financial needs has remained the same.", "There are currently some new economic challenges with the U.S. government shutdown and a possibility of the government defaulting on its debt, but prior to these recent events the economy had continued its pace of moderate growth with gains in consumer spending, business investment and employment. While the recovery remains uneven, there are many positive signs including increased small business optimism and a dramatic improvement in household net worth, with household leverage now lower than any time since 2002 which provides capacity for consumer spending and borrowing going forward.", "The housing market also continues to demonstrate strong momentum. While as expected higher rates reduced mortgage refinancing activity this quarter, home price appreciation remains strong and affordability remains excellent. This improvement has benefited our customers and contributed to our overall credit performance. Let me take a moment to comment on the current situation in Washington and how we think about the implications for Wells Fargo.", "A prolonged government shutdown and potential debt ceiling breach is unnecessary and troublesome that will likely create new needs for our customers and their families. I have asked our business leaders to identify ways we can help our customers directly affected by the shutdown. Whether its furlough, government workers or our customer distressed by agency closures and we stand ready to assist our customers during this period.", "More importantly for our country I feel it is important for our leaders in Washington to set aside partisan differences, break the logjam and find workable solutions that are in the best interest of our nation and our economy. I'm encouraged by the news coming all over the nation's capital yesterday. We've managed through changing environments in the past and our experience and vision will guide us through this period of transition as well.", "Our results this quarter reflected the dynamic environment we are in and the benefit of our diversity. Let me share some highlights. Our record earnings of $5.6 billion and record earnings per share of $0.99 were up 13% from a year ago. Our core loan portfolio grew by $44.2 billion, up 6%. This strong performance was broad based with growth in our commercial and consumer portfolios reflecting organic growth and the acquisition of two commercial real estate portfolios.", "Our credit performance was exceptional as we continue to benefit from our conservative underwriting and improving economic conditions especially in housing with the net charge-offs down to 48 basis points annualized and our total net charge-off dollars down 59% from a year ago. Our outstanding deposit franchise continued to generate strong deposit growth with average deposits up $79.1 billion from the year ago while reduced deposit costs by 6 basis points to just 12 basis points for the entire portfolio.", "We deepened relationships across our company achieving record retail banking cross-sell of 6.15 products per household. Wholesale Banking grew their cross-sell to 7 products and Wealth Brokerage Retirement cross-sell increased to 10.41 products. We had very strong returns, growing return assets by 8 basis points to 1.53% and return on equity increased by 69 basis points to 14.07%.", "Our capital levels continued to grow and our estimated Tier 1 common equity under Basel III increased to 9.54% surpassing our stated 9% target. We look forward to the upcoming CCAR process where we expect to request a higher dividend and an increase to our share repurchases.", "Tim will now provide more details on our third quarter results. Tim?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then take your questions.", "Our financial results this quarter demonstrated the benefit of our diversity and our risk discipline as we continue to produce strong results. Wells Fargo earned a record $5.6 billion and grew earnings per share to $0.99 both up 13% from a year ago. We've now achieved 15 consecutive quarters of earnings per share growth and 10 consecutive quarters of record EPS.", "As John highlighted and as you can see on Page 3, our year-over-year results reflected loan growth that was well diversified as well as strong deposit growth. Lower mortgage banking revenue resulted in the decline in pre-tax pre-provision profit compared with the year ago. The higher rate environment which has reduced mortgage refinancing volume has resulted in a transitional period for our mortgage business.", "We had expected and planned for lower mortgage volumes and have managed through these periods in the past. I'll provide more detail on mortgage trends later in the call. However, we're still able to grow earnings and increase returns driven by strong net interest income, fee growth across many of our businesses and significantly improve credit.", "Our revenue diversification is highlighted on Page 4. Different businesses naturally contribute more or less to our revenue depending upon the economic and interest rate environment but our revenue remained almost evenly split between net interest and non-interest income and our sources of fee income were very well diversified. This is a benefit of our business model. We don't rely on any one business to generate growth.", "Let me start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our third quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on Page 5. Our balance sheet has never been stronger. We increased earning assets by growing loans and purchasing securities. We continue to strengthen our capital levels even as we return more capital to our shareholders.", "Let me take a moment to highlight our improved liquidity position. While we believe our liquidity position was already strong, with heightened regulatory expectations we've been adding to our position over the past few months. We increased long-term debt and term deposits at very low rates and most of the proceeds went into cash and short-term investments. While building our liquidity puts some pressure on our net interest margin, it did not impact our bottom line.", "Turning to the income statement on Page 6. Net interest income remains strong driven by a $23.3 billion increase in average earning assets. Mortgage revenue declined as expected but we had growth in other fee categories. Our expenses declined driven by lower personnel expense and lower operating losses.", "Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.9%. During the quarter we finalized settlements with tax authorities regarding prior period tax issues primarily associated with certain cross border transactions. Primarily due to these settlements we recorded a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions which resulted in a tax benefit in the third quarter of $166 million.", "Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on Page 7, we continue to have strong loan growth with period-end loans up $29.7 billion or 4% from a year ago and up $10.3 billion from the second quarter. Excluding our liquidating portfolio, our core portfolio grew by $44.2 billion or 6% from a year ago and was up $13.8 billion from the second quarter.", "Commercial loans grew $8.5 billion in the quarter with broad based organic growth and $5.2 billion from acquisitions. Consumer loans grew $1.8 billion with growth in nonconforming first mortgage loans, auto, credit card and private student lending partially offset by the expected run-off from the liquidating portfolio and core home equity loans.", "Even during a period with tepid industry loan growth, we've been able to grow our loans on a year-over-year basis for nine consecutive quarters and for the past six quarters, year-over-year growth has been at least 3% despite run-off from our liquidating portfolio. Our growth is a result of remaining committed to meeting the financing needs of our customers and benefiting from opportunities to grow through acquisitions.", "On Slide 8 we highlight the drivers of our loan growth from a year ago. Real estate one through four family first mortgage loans grew $14.4 billion or 6% even with the run-off from our liquidating portfolio and included growth in high quality nonconforming mortgages and the retention of conforming mortgages.", "C&I loans were up $13.5 billion or 8%. We have broad based growth in asset backed finance, government banking, corporate banking and commercial banking. Foreign loans grew $6.9 billion or 17% which included $4 billion from the U.K. CRE acquisition we completed in the quarter as well as trade finance growth.", "Auto loans were up $3.6 billion or 8% reflecting continued strong originations. Credit card balances were up $1.8 billion or 7% with strong new account growth reflecting increased card penetration as well as marketing efforts.", "Deposit growth remained strong with average deposits up $15.8 billion in the second quarter and up $79.1 billion or 8% from a year ago. We grew our primary consumer checking customers by a net 3.9% from a year ago, up from 3.5% last quarter. The growth in these relationship-based customers should benefit our future results as we remain focused on meeting more of our customers' needs.", "We continue to reduce deposit costs which were down 6 basis points from a year ago and 2 basis points from the second quarter. We've successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit costs for 10 consecutive quarters with average deposit costs declining to 12 basis points in the third quarter. Our strong deposit performance over an extended period of time is a fundamental strength of our franchise.", "As shown on Page 10, tax-equivalent net interest income remained strong. Our ability to grow net interest income over the past year while the net interest margin has declined 28 basis points reflected the benefit of our loan growth and our disciplined approach to investing. Net interest income was essentially unchanged from the second quarter benefiting from one additional day in the quarter, higher securities balances, loan growth and lower funding costs. These benefits were offset by an expected decline in mortgages held for sale and lower variable income.", "Average earning assets grew $23.3 billion from the second quarter reflecting increases in short-term investments, AFS securities and loans. We purchased $19.8 billion of AFS securities primarily in the form of agency MBS during the third quarter prior to the decline in rates late in the quarter. While our net interest income remains stable, our net interest margin declined by 8 basis points from the second quarter to 3.38%. This decline was driven by four primary factors.", "First, our continued deposit growth which has little impact on net interest income but is dilutive to the NIM reduced the margin by 3 basis points. The liquidity-related actions that we took in the quarter reduced the margin by 3 basis points also. The net impact of balance sheet repricing and growth reduced the margin by 1 basis point. And then finally, variable income which includes PCI loan resolutions and periodic dividends was lower this quarter and reduced the margin by 1 basis point. We currently expect continued net interest margin pressure.", "Non-interest income was down $898 million in the second quarter, driven primarily by lower mortgage refinanced volume and reduced gain on sale margins which I'll highlight shortly. Because of the reduction in mortgage revenue and the impact from seasonality on a linked quarter basis can make it difficult to demonstrate the underlying momentum we have in many of our businesses. It's helpful to look at our year-over-year trends excluding mortgage.", "On Page 11 we show noninterest income excluding mortgage banking and you can see that we grew 5% compared with the year ago. Let me highlight some of the momentum we have across a number of our businesses. Deposit service charges were up $68 million from a year ago benefiting from strong account growth. Trust and investment fees were up $322 million with strong growth in brokerage, asset base fees and investment banking.", "Card fees were up $69 million benefiting from strong account growth and increased usage in both our credit and debit card business. Commercial real estate brokerage commissions grew $35 million from strong private and public market activity. Equity gains were up $338 million reflecting gains from several transitions in the quarter. Equity gains are naturally volatile on a quarterly basis but on a year-to-date basis, gains are only up $48 million compared with 2012.", "We're in a transitional period in our mortgage business. As expected with the increase in mortgage rates, our mortgage origination volume declined this quarter, particularly refinance activity as highlighted on Page 12. We've managed through many refi cycles in the past. We remain committed to the mortgage business which is an important product for our customers and benefits from our cross sell focus.", "We originated $80 billion of mortgages in the third quarter and with the rise in rates, refi volume declined to 41% of originations down from 56% in the second quarter and down from 71% in the first quarter of 2012. Purchase volume remained relatively strong in the third quarter, down 4% from the second quarter benefiting from the continued strong housing market.", "Our unclosed pipeline declined to $35 billion at the end of the quarter reflecting lower application volume and shorter processing times to close mortgage loans as capacities increased. If rates remain where they are today we would expect lower origination volume in the fourth quarter reflecting lower refi volume and normal fourth quarter seasonality in the purchase market.", "Our gain on sale margin declined from the historically high levels we experienced for the past year to 1.42%. As rates seemed to have stabilized and competition has remained rational, we currently expect the margin to remain relatively steady in the fourth quarter. Reflecting lower origination volume, we had lower incentive compensation expenses related to mortgage production in the quarter.", "We announced reductions of 5,300 mortgage FTEs in the third quarter which increased our severance costs. Most of the expense reduction from the lower FTEs was not reflected in our expense numbers for the third quarter because of the notice period we provided to our team members. But you should begin to see reduction expenses more significantly during the fourth quarter and we will continue to manage our capacity based on demand.", "While higher mortgage rates reduced our mortgage refi volume, they benefit our servicing business. Our servicing revenue was up $111 million from the second quarter benefiting from a slowdown in the economic amortization of mortgage servicing rates. As we announced last week, we've reached an agreement with Freddie Mac that resolves substantially all repurchase liabilities for loans sold prior to 2009.", "The cost of this agreement was fully approved for in prior periods. As a result our outstanding repurchase demands were down 25% from the second quarter and for the first time in over five years, we did not add to our repurchase reserves in the third quarter other than reserves established for current period loan sales.", "Expenses declined $153 million in the second quarter as shown on Page 13. Salary expense was up $142 million which included $63 million in mortgage-related severance expense. Incentive compensation expense was down $225 million driven by lower mortgage revenue and lower capital markets and retail brokerage activity. Expenses also reflected lower operating losses, down $93 million primarily from lower litigation accruals.", "The environmentally elevated costs primarily related to our residential mortgage business that we've highlighted over the last few quarters have been significantly reduced. However, over time we do expect to recognize additional benefits from a continued improvement in the housing market including additional reductions to these costs. We had higher expenses related to the regulatory environment and our compliance activities.", "We've had a long history of strong risk management practices and in response to the heightened regulatory environment, our expenses increased by approximately $200 million annually. Our efficiency ratio rose to 59.1% in the quarter reflecting the immediate impact of the reduction in mortgage origination volume. We expect our efficiency ratio to improve in the fourth quarter and we continue to target an efficiency ratio between 55% and 59%.", "Turning to our business segments starting on Page 14, Community Banking earned $3.3 billion in the third quarter, up 3% from the second quarter and up 22% from a year ago. Retail Banking continued to consistently grow cross sell achieving a record of 6.15 products per household, up from 6.04 a year ago. We continued to benefit from momentum in the credit card business by growing accounts, purchase volumes and balances. We had record new accounts, up 9% from a year ago and household penetration increased to 36%, up from 32% a year ago and 28% just two years ago as we continued to increase marketing and enhance our product line.", "The 14% increase in purchase volume from a year ago reflects this account growth and an increase in active accounts. Credit card balances were up 3% from the second quarter and up 7% from a year ago. We also had strong loan growth in our auto business with balances up 2% from the second quarter and up 8% from a year ago. Originations were down 3% from the second quarter due to seasonality but up 9% from a year ago.", "By remaining focused on serving the needs of all our small business customers, we were once again America's #1 small business lender in dollars for the 11th consecutive year. We extended $14.2 billion of new loan commitments to small business customers during the first nine months of 2013, up 24% from a year ago.", "Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter, down 2% from the second quarter with lower sales and trading, investment banking and seasonally lower crop insurance fees. Earnings were down 1% from a year ago as lower sales and trading income offset growth in other commercial businesses and strong loan and deposit growth. While revenue was down from a year ago, we had strong momentum across a number of our commercial businesses including a 10% increase in treasury management revenue. This growth was driven by strong sales growth including continued penetration of existing customers as well as new customer growth and pricing increases.", "In addition, commercial card treasury management spend volume increased 22% compared with the year ago. Wholesale Banking also benefited from growth in assets under management with AUM up 6% from a year ago driven by strong net inflows and market performance. Wholesale Banking's cross sell grew to 7 products per relationship, up from 6.7 a year ago.", "Wholesale Banking results continued to benefit from consistent loan growth with loans having grown for 12 consecutive quarters. The average loans grew 5% compared with the year ago and was broad based with growth coming from nearly all our portfolios including asset backed finance, capital finance, commercial banking, commercial real estate, corporate banking, equipment finance and government and institutional banking. As I mentioned earlier loan growth also benefited from U.K. and U.S. commercial real estate acquisitions.", "Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement earned $450 million in the third quarter, up 4% from the second quarter driven by higher net interest income and improved credit quality, partially offset by seasonally lower brokerage transaction revenues. Earnings were up 33% from a year ago driven by strong growth in asset based fees, higher net interest income and improved credit quality.", "Revenue grew 9% from a year ago reflecting strong growth in asset based fees and higher net interest income. Retail brokerage managed account assets grew to a record $350 billion, up 18% from a year ago driven by strong market performance and net flows.", "WBR has strong balance sheet growth with average loans and deposits up 10% from a year ago. Loan balances were up 3% from the second quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of linked quarter growth. The benefit of meeting all the financial needs of our customers was also reflected in WBR settling and increasing cross sell, growing to 10.41 products per household in the third quarter up from 10.27 a year ago.", "Turning to credit quality on Page 17. Our strong performance reflected our long-term risk focus and the benefit from the improving housing market. Third quarter net charge-offs declined to historically low levels, only 48 basis points of average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only $19 million or 2 basis points of average loans. Consumer losses declined to 86 basis points.", "We continue to have especially strong improvement in our commercial and residential real estate portfolios. Our commercial real estate portfolios were once again in a net recovery position and our consumer real estate portfolios reduced their losses by $1.2 billion from a year ago, down 70%.", "Reflecting these improvements, our provision expense declined $577 million from the second quarter to $75 million and included a $900 million reserve release compared with the release of $500 million in the second quarter. Given current favorable conditions, we continue to expect future reserve releases absent a significant deterioration in the economy.", "In addition to lower charge-offs in provision expense, non-performing assets also improved, NPAs down $360 million from the second quarter. Nonaccrual loans declined $1 billion, while foreclosed assets increased $662 million driven by an increase in government and shared foreclosed assets. The increase was primarily driven by enhancements for loan modification programs, slowing foreclosures in prior quarters.", "Loans 90 days or more past due decreased $104 million from the second quarter and was down 30% from a year ago with improvement in both commercial and consumer loans. Early stage consumer loan delinquency balances and rates also declined from the second quarter and from a year ago.", "Our estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel III increased to 9.54%, exceeding our target of 9% for the first time which includes a 100 basis point internal capital buffer. The growth in the Basel III ratio demonstrated our strong underlying earnings performance and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, reflecting an improved company credit profile and model refinements for commercial portfolios.", "In addition, after the Basel rules were finalized, we took a number of actions to reduce RWA. We disposed of an asset that had a punitive risk weighting and generated and evaluated more granular data on underlying investments of our BOLI assets.", "We've reduced our common share count by $28.4 million from the second quarter. We purchased 50.9 million shares and we executed a $400 million forward contract that is expected to settle in the fourth quarter for approximately 9.8 million shares. We are focused on returning more capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "In summary, we had another solid quarter by focusing on our vision of meeting our customers' financial needs, resulting in strong loan growth and deposit growth. We benefited from a continued improvement in credit quality with losses down significantly, reflecting our conservative underwriting and an improvement in the economy, especially the rebound in housing. Our ROA and ROE continued to grow and we had strong capital generation which will benefit us as we enter the upcoming CCAR process.", "We'll now open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Morning. My first question\u2026", "John G. Stumpf", "Good morning, Erika.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Morning. With the provision at $75 million this quarter and your efficiency ratio at 59%, to continue the record quarterly earnings growth for next quarter, it seems like you have to move to the midpoint of your efficiency ratio. I guess the question really here is, is can you get to the midpoint of your efficiency ratio next quarter all through cutting mortgage expense?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Erika, I would push back a little bit on the math there because that just assumes that we only have one lever to pull and that's expenses. If you step back and look at the performance that we had this quarter, you saw broad based growth across the company. There is no question that the efficiency ratio deteriorated a little bit, but that was just because of the immediate impact of the mortgage revenue decline. Our expectation for all of our businesses is that we're going to see growth over time. We believe that we're going to improve the expense efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter and we're hopeful that credit continues to improve. As I mentioned, we believe that we can \u2013 that we'll have further loan loss reserve releases. So I don't think it's necessarily going to be one item that's going to impact our earnings next quarter and that's really been the case for the last 15 quarters. Every quarter is a little bit different and that's fine because we've got the diversity and the strength in our businesses to be able to grow regardless of what's thrown at us.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. So I guess the message there is, we should expect efficiency improvement next quarter and you'll get there through both \u2013 on both sides of the denominator \u2013 I'm sorry, both sides of the equation, denominator and numerator?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, that's correct. We expect our efficiency ratio to improve in the fourth quarter from the third quarter results.", "John G. Stumpf", "Erika, if you look at and you do the balance sheet, you just think of the growth we had this quarter and the last number of quarters in loans, those \u2013 that's the first call in our liquidity. Secondly, we do have liquidity \u2013 ample liquidity there. This past quarter we were able as we have in recent quarters to deal with liability costs. So there are lots of things going on here and as Tim mentioned, the expense side is an important side that's not the only lever.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. My second question and then I'll step back is on capital return for next year. I think we hear you loud and clear that we should expect more capital return next year versus this year and my question is really on the CCAR process. Given sort of the fluidity on U.S. leverage standards and global leverage standards, which doesn't impact you as much as other large banks, but I guess, how do the regulators think of the buyback authorization that they approve relative to the fluidity of the new leverage rules? I guess the real question there is without the leverage proposals being final in the U.S. or globally, will they allow banks to announce large authorizations on buyback thinking that if something changes with the rules or the rules are just as stringent as proposed, you could dial back your actual buyback relative to your authorization?", "John G. Stumpf", "Here is how we think about that. If you think about the CCAR process, we now have \u2013 every year we do this, we learn more. We have more experience. Rules that were proposed are becoming more known, not everything that's known today but this CCAR process will know a lot more about final roads that we knew in the past, that doesn't mean everything is known. Secondly, we have made great progress. Tim mentioned and I mentioned in our comments that if you look at just one ratio but we don't look at only one, the Tier 1 common using Basel III rules as we understand them, we're over the 7% plus the 1% SIFI buffer gets us 8%, [indiscernible] 1% to 9%, we're already 9.50% \u2013 north of 9.50%. In our company, the way you run it here is really about shareholder and you saw the activity we had last year in returning capital to our stockholders. We purposely made a comment, both Tim and I did, about returning more to our shareholders and we're looking forward to this upcoming CCAR process. It's surely an iterative process. It's collaborative with Federal Reserve. I don't want to get ahead of that process, but I know you appreciate how much we care about returning and we're in a great position to do that. So let's see where it all ends up.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, John.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi. Good morning. Hi, John. I was wondering on the liquidity additions Tim, was this in preparation for your expectation of what the rules will be on LCR or OLA or both and do you anticipate doing more of this liquidity build in coming quarters, are you now positioned for your kind of best read of what you expect on these rules?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, a very good question, I'm glad you asked it. Had nothing to do with OLA, we primarily focused on just liquidity. We've always operated the company with a sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of our customers and also weather the volatility of the markets and we've seen a lot of volatility over the last few years for sure. But that said, there's no question that the regulatory expectations through the industry have increased and we've been building liquidity throughout the year, and I think the important thing is that throughout the year as well as in this quarter, it didn't affect our ability to serve customers, invest in securities when rates were higher or as you've seen report another quarter of record earnings. But we did accelerate the liquidity build this quarter and were able to do so in a way that was favorable because of the strong balance sheet that we have. To your question about the standards, we don't know what the domestic standard is going to be. Our expectation is that will be announced sometime toward the end of this year. But as it relates to the international standard, we've exceeded that. But again, we don't want to make a big deal about that, because that's not really the standard that's going to \u2013 that we're going to operate under. It's going to be the domestic standard. But I wouldn't worry about our ability to have sufficient liquidity to meet the standards, to serve our customers to continue to generate earnings.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. On the mortgage side, any sense for how much the mortgage originations could fall in the fourth quarter? Can we look at the decline in the end of quarter pipeline as a guide to the possible magnitude from a decline from the $80 billion level or what's the danger of us doing that?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes. Well, there's always danger in something, right John. But I think a big driver for mortgage origination volume is going to be where rates turn out. I mean, we've seen that in a great form this last quarter. Assuming that we're going to stay in this current interest rate environment, our expectation is that the mortgage originations will be down. The reason that I didn't provide any more specific guidance is that we're early in the quarter. Having said that, I wouldn't use the point to point reduction in pipeline as the primary driver for coming up with any sort of expectation about mortgage origination volume because what we're experiencing right now in terms of the business is that there are closing times from origination to close on a mortgage are shortening up. It's the case for us as well as I'm sure the entire industry. So I wouldn't jump to that conclusion. I assume they are going to be down but in terms of exactly how much, I really \u2013 it would be premature to guess right now.", "John G. Stumpf", "John, I think the thing that we should all remember on the mortgage business is while refinance volume is down and it has an impact on us, the improvement in the housing is really good for America, good for our customers and also going to be good for our company. We've been through these cycles before and affordability still remains very attractive. Also leverage has come down and the interest by Americans in home ownership is still there. So this is just a great thing. People are feeling better and we'll respond as volumes go up and down and so forth. We've done that in the past. But an improving housing market is good, it's good for everyone.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Thanks John. One quick follow-up. Tim, if the current credit trends persist, is there any reason we couldn't see the reserve releases remain at the current level in this $900 million ballpark we saw this quarter?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "John, I'd hesitate to provide you with the specific number because that's the process that we decide at the end of the quarter. I do think as we said that you should have an expectation that we will continue to have reserve releases because of the trends that we're seeing not only in terms of the continued improvement in our portfolio, but because of the continued improvement in home prices. So we'll have a release in the fourth quarter. I don't know what it's going to be, but you should count on us having a release.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Thank you.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thank you.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you, John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Excluding acquisitions on the end of period basis, it looked like core loan growth strengthened a bit in the quarter. How do you feel about demand through year-end and how much of these uncertainties around the government shutdown and the debt ceiling are affecting customer sentiment at this point?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, I would say that it's a little bit too soon to gauge the impact as to what the \u2013 how consumers and our commercial customers are going to react to what's going on or not going on in Washington. But the trends that we saw in the third quarter as you said ex the acquisition are continuing. I don't know what the growth is going to be, but I think what we were really excited about in the third quarter was how broad based loan growth was. It wasn't just in one of our portfolios in wholesale, it wasn't just in WBR, it wasn't just in one of the consumer portfolios, so it's broad based. This gets back to John's comments about the recovery. Again setting what's going on in Washington aside, we're in the midst of recovery. It's a little bit uneven, but because of our diversification we're able to pick up wherever the loan growth might be. Again I think it's really a testament to the team that we have out there dealing with customers every day, because we're continuing to grow at a multiple of what the underlying industry is growing at.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "You announced a couple of loan portfolio acquisitions in the quarter, do you expect to see more of these opportunities in coming months? And just how competitive are these situations given that industry loan growth overall is fairly sluggish?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, you know what, Joe, you got to pay the highest price to win, so there are always going to be competitive. But we've been very pleased over the last two years to have been in the position because of our financial condition, our liquidity, our capital position to be able to acquire a number of loan portfolios. We're hopeful that we'll continue to see opportunities to make acquisitions of good quality loan portfolios in the future. We certainly don't count on it and we don't assume that we need it to be able to grow earnings. But the short answer is there's competition out there, but the fact of the matter is that we view it as a good counterparty to sell to because we got very experienced people that can provide a good underwriting. We are able to transform that into competitive bids and when we say, we're going to close we close.", "John G. Stumpf", "Tim's absolutely right on that. I think it's a competitive advantage we have for those reasons. But we also \u2013 and you know this, we don't do every deal we look at. I mean we look at a number of things and transactions, but it doesn't add to our customer base. I mean these are not only loans, these are customers and we're doing more things with them besides just the loan. As you go through a number of these, it's logical that there'll be fewer available, but we still as I always say kick a lot of tires but the ones we bring home are the ones that really add value to our customer base.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thanks, Joe.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Hi. Good morning.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Betsy.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Hi, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Just a couple of questions on mortgage expense side, I'm wondering if you could just give us a sense of the amount of mortgage expense reduction you already have in your 3Q run rate? And roughly how far along you think you are in that reduction based on current volumes? And when you think you'd get to your new run rate of expenses there?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Betsy, it's a real good question. The primary reduction in expenses in the third quarter from the mortgage business was really in the incentive compensation line, which we mentioned.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Right.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Most of the 5,300 team members that were noticed in the third quarter were still with us as of the end of the quarter, so most of that expense just the underlying personnel expense was not out of the run rate. So you're going to see that come out of the run rate during the fourth quarter and our expectation is that as we start the first quarter, it will be completely out of the run rate. So not a lot of reduction with the exception of incentive comp in the third quarter metering through the fourth quarter and then out in the first quarter.", "John G. Stumpf", "In fact, Tim's right. Actually it's a little bit \u2013 we actually took a charge in the third quarter for severance. So that actually went through the expense numbers, so you can almost argue that it was elevated by $63 million or so, whatever the \u2013 so Tim is right that the direct variable is out but the support costs actually unusually went up for the quarter.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And then on the MSR valuation with the backup in rates, I guess I was a bit surprised not to see a higher upward revaluation. Maybe you can speak a little bit too how you got to your number.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Sure. There is no question that we've had obviously a bit of a backup in rates, but we did reduce the value of the MSR by about $240 million and the driver for that was the assumption that we have regarding prepayments during the quarter because of the increase in home values. Again we try to appropriately hedge the portfolio, so the impact was primarily driven by the change in the estimate of prepayments.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So the LTV is outweighing the rate impact still?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "So far that's correct.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just one last thing. You have your card partnership that you announced recently with American Express.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about offering that product versus your other card products. I mean, how do you determine which one you're going to be marketing to your different client bases and maybe if you could let us understand if there is a merchant angle to the AMEX partnership as well?", "John G. Stumpf", "Betsy, that's an area of opportunity and focus for our company. Just a little bit of history here. When we put Wells and Wachovia together that we announced it almost five years ago to this day, they had of course sold their current portfolio MBNA and when we put the two companies together, we had something like a 18% or 20% penetration to our customer base. Today, it happens to be 35%, 36% and we're really growing that. But we knew and understood there was a client base within our customer base who call us their bank, who carry a card but not our card and have tended to be in some cases a high-end card, or it was a card that fit really nicely with what we're now partnering with American Express. We all have a personal goal round here to satisfy all of our customers' needs and help them succeed financially. We're not satisfied here with a 35% or 36% penetration into our customer base on card. Every one of our current customers \u2013 customers has a card. They probably have more than one card. We want our card to be the top of their wallet. By expanding our partnership to American Express in some spaces, this will be hugely valuable in helping us do that. It's not only from the economics of the card, it's from the payments when we have customers better and so forth. You're right, we do a lot of things on the issuing side and this will help us there. We're also a big company on the acquiring side, the merchant side. We'll be sharing more of that as time goes on, but we're really excited about continuing to grow the penetration of our customers who carry our card.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, guys.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Matt.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Hi, Matt.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "I was just hoping to drill down on the expenses a little bit. Obviously as we go forward there is the severance coming out, there is the capacity reduction in mortgage that has already taken place and I'd assume some more to come as pressure comes down. But can you give us a sense of what the all-in run rate of expenses maybe for the revenue environment that you see out there?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No. We don't look at the expense number as a number and we're not going to be able to provide the guidance. I certainly appreciate why you asked the question. We really look at our performance based upon the efficiency rate. We provided guidance year and a half ago that we want to be in the 55% to 59% range. It deteriorated, as I mentioned, a bit this quarter because of the median impact of the mortgage revenue decline. We are going to improve our efficiency in the fourth quarter and we're going to continue to look at our expenses based upon our efficiency ratio because it's got to be as a percentage of revenues. Matt, it would not be difficult if we wanted to just to cut expenses. The problem is when you look at your expenses just in terms of dollars and you just focus on the dollar reduction, you have the propensity and we've seen this for lots of companies over the years then give up revenues and we are not going to do that. This is a revenue-focused company that's got to deliver expenses efficiently and we're going to continue to do that. So again, I appreciate the question but we're not going to provide any dollar guidance.", "John G. Stumpf", "Just one added comment. We still believe and we've mentioned this I think every quarter that we have opportunities. We're spending more in some areas compliance, risk and so forth. On the other hand we continue to innovate with our customers, with our delivery models. I mean our neighborhood store in Washington, D.C. has an operating cost basis 40% less than a traditional store and we're making investments at the ATM about taking paper out and all kinds of things but never at the expense of serving customers or at the expense of walking away from revenue. There's always a balance there and that's why we have \u2013 we talk in terms of an efficiency ratio and we still feel comfortable with those guardrails.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "I mean obviously a lot of that stuff has come up so far in the call, but just thinking now beyond the fourth quarter to next year. I mean it seems like it's going to be a tough revenue environment for a lot of folks including you guys and even beyond the mortgage costs, so it does feel like there's other opportunities. So I think over time to put some numbers around that might be helpful. Just separately on the sale of MSRs over time, any sense or color that you can provide in terms of how meaningful those could be both just in absolute sense and then I guess from like a gain perspective?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Matt, I wouldn't look for us to start to sell MSRs just from a gain perspective. I think as we've talked about in the past, we do think it's prudent from a risk management standpoint to look at the MSR portfolio and take advantage of the fact there's more demand for mortgage servicing rights today than there was six months ago or a year ago. So don't be surprised if we do sell some of our MSRs. I don't expect it to be a material reduction. But I think from a risk management standpoint, it's good to go ahead and test the waters every once in a while and you should expect that we'll probably be doing that in the next few quarters.", "John G. Stumpf", "Matt, as far as going forward you mentioned the next few quarter and what we're excited about here is you look at \u2013 first of all, you look at the absolute performance of the company in a pretty difficult environment. North of 14% return on equity and a ROI north of 150. But if you look at the liquidity we have now on the balance sheet, almost $200 billion in the first column that is for serving customers, loans. You look at the opportunity we have in certain businesses like cards, in Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement and insurance distribution in addition to all the existing businesses, our ability to grow loans, outgrow the industry, there is also a lot of opportunity here. Surely headwinds, we get that but not foreign to us and that's why we like this. As we have many times talked about the 85 to 90 horses that pull this coach along and being in different businesses.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Marty.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Thank you. Hi.", "John G. Stumpf", "Marty, thanks for being a Dodgers fan by the way.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "I appreciate that. You never know what you're going to get asked when you get out there. I have two technical kind of mortgage questions and I had one general kind of balance sheet question. On the gain on sale margin dropping from 220 down to around 140, the curiosity I had was because you recognize your gain on sale at closing or funding, a lot of times you have spike in interest rates, you have a close rate that actually increases pretty substantially and can create a loss. How do you know what the acceleration of the drop on this gain on sale margin wasn't tied somewhat to that phenomenon, which is pretty unusual and only happens when you have these real dramatic shifts in rates like we just went through?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Marty, you raised a good point and you're going in the right direction, but it wasn't because of any sort of a loss. I think very frequently when you're in a period of a decline in rate as you're referring to you do get an acceleration in terms of the decline in rate of your margin. I would describe that as more of a competitive impact as well as sometimes a mixed impact from whether your originations are coming from the retailer or correspondent business. So there was no question that because of the rapid increase in rate, there was a more rapid decline in the margin. That said, our expectation given if you believe that interest rates have more or less stabilized right now and also given the competitive environment that we think that the margin is more or less going to stay in this range for the next quarter.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Just to kind of hit on that one last time was, did you have any pull through in a sense of when you're doing refis you kind of think there is always going to be some breakage, was there any increase in the closure rate as the rates went higher because the refi folks just want to go in and make sure they got that locked in rate?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No, I wouldn't say that. I do think what we did see toward the end of the quarter once rates started to come down the last few weeks of the month, we did see an increase in volume on a daily basis just because there were folks that were hoping to have refinanced and then once they saw rates rise, they put the brakes on that. And when they saw rates fall, they wanted to take advantage of it; but beyond that nothing more.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Okay. And then the other technical question in mortgage was when you're looking at the servicing hedging, you used swaps. The majority of your hedging is in swaps. When the rates went up, you can really kind of restructure that swap portfolio or you can start to increase positive carry. I just didn't know if you had the chance to take advantage of that with that spike in rates that we got in the third quarter.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, there is no question that with the volatility in rates, we needed to watch our hedging very, very closely and there was more volatility in that this quarter. But we really \u2013 what we didn't \u2013 just because of where rates went this quarter, we didn't change the fundamental strategy in terms of how we hedge or the hedge ratios to try to speculate on where rates are going to go. We really want to look at that servicing business based upon on the hedge carry and not try to either increase it or decrease it too much based upon where rates are going.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "All I was getting at was you can kind of keep the same hedge ratio while taking advantage of a wider steeper yield curve, sometimes there is a benefit related to that. So I was just curious if that is something that you were able to take advantage of when you had that opportunity?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Not materially, no.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Okay. And then lastly, John, you brought up the fact that your liquidity had increased so substantially, I mean it's around $200 billion which is about twice what it was last year. So as much as you try to eat into that with purchase in the securities portfolio or loan growth, the deposit growth just keeps outpacing what you're able to do on the asset side. What's your thought that as this number gets to be so substantial, how you take that and begin to utilize it given the opportunity that you have right now?", "John G. Stumpf", "Sure. Well, I think that's one of the hidden strengths here in the company in that the loan \u2013 customers that are looking to borrow money, we think they have the first call on that. We surely will be thoughtful about making investments as we see backups. So there is a lot of what I would call dry powder there that's available and a lot of that's just because of what the deposit growth has been. I mean we've grown deposits over the last year by about $79.1 billion or $80 billion and we brought even the cost of deposits down by 6 basis points, down to 12 basis points. And I said this I think in the past and you know this that we're not turning away customers. If a customer \u2013 and we grow \u2013 we've been growing our primary checking accounts by 3.6 to 3.9 depending whether you're talking about small business or consumer, they bring lot other stuff to us when they do this. And even though it might not look like a great trade today or tomorrow, it's a fabulous trade over time. I'll take all the customer households with all of the checking accounts and all the balances they want to bring here, because it's going to pay huge dividends.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Just a slight follow-up to that is \u2013 and this is a tough question. How much of this $200 billion do you all estimate is related \u2013 is sustainable through this cycle and not just temporarily parked on your balance sheet? And thanks for all the time this morning.", "John G. Stumpf", "I think when it comes to primary accounts, they're very sticky. If you look at the makeup of the liability side of our balance sheet, of the $1.03 trillion or $1.04 trillion, only about $40 billion in CDs, I mean these are accounts that people \u2013 they are transaction accounts, they are checking accounts, savings accounts and that's where people believe and if you ask where they bank, they'll say, I bank at Wells Fargo because that's where their basic and main account is. It's a driver of almost every sales on the retail side. So very much \u2013 the lion's share of that is core. If rates back up, will there be some disintermediation? Yes, likely maybe within the company, but probably a lot less than other companies or others that would have more one product households, so called hot money. That's just not who we are.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Understood, thanks.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Thanks, Marty.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Hi.", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Good morning, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Hi. How important is it to have consecutive quarters of increasingly higher EPS growth and I'll get back to my question in a second. I know it's probably an outcome of the way you run the business?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Mike, that's exactly right. It's an outcome. We don't set about trying to hit a certain earnings number. What we do is we try to set about serving our customers' needs and the earnings are just an outcome. The fact that we highlight it is something because we're proud of it. We've had 270,000 people working really, really hard for the last quarter in a pretty interesting environment where there have been a lot of headwinds, we've talked about some of them and we're very proud of the performance. We hope that continues. But it's an outcome not a goal.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "I know I've asked the question on past conference calls, how do you mind the gap to the times when mortgage revenues decline and you don't yet have a chance to cut expenses. It seems like the answer this quarter was partly reserve releases, which equaled over one-tenth of your earnings for the quarter. So I'm trying to understand the offsets a little bit better and you've touched on a lot of them. But what sort of expense or efficiency gains should you get from those 5,300 employees leaving the mortgage business in the third quarter. Can you put any numbers on that?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No. Mike, it's a very fair question and I think if you look back on any of the 15 quarters that you were referring to, every quarter is going to have a little bit different complexion and I bet \u2013 as we look back, I don't bet I know, if you look back in every one of those quarters there has been some sort of headwind that we've had to deal with. I think that whether it's \u2013 we've been through in those quarters the ups and downs in the mortgage business. We've been through the ups and downs in credit. We've been through the ups and downs in operating losses and so on and so forth. And I think the important thing to appreciate again is that it's not just one driver that's going to get us to continue to be able \u2013 that's going to allow us to continue to be able to grow the company, right. You saw this quarter \u2013 I mean, the fundamentals are pretty exciting. $10.3 billion of point-to-point loan growth, multiple the industry average. You saw year-over-year non-mortgage fee revenue up 5%, again multiple of what the underlying economy is growing. You've seen deposits grow as John was just talking about. We're not going to turn down deposits. We want to weigh them in. Those are great relationships. Expenses are down from the second quarter to the third quarter $150 million and the improvement in credit is terrific, right. Sure, we had a reserve release but the reserve release is a result of a lot of good decisions over a long period of time. So we're just \u2013 everything that we've done this quarter is really core to banking, right, its core to our performance. So it's not just going to be one thing. It's going to be the combination of everything. If it was just one item we'd point to and we move on, but that's what's exciting about Wells Fargo is the diversity of the business model.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "If I can just have a follow-up one on revenues and one on expenses. As far as you increased securities by $10 billion during the quarter and you bought the commercial real estate portfolios for another $5 billion. When in the quarter did those go on roughly; the beginning, the middle or the end?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Most of the securities purchases were done toward the beginning, to the middle of the quarter when rates were higher. Then as rates dropped after the Fed announcement, we slowed down our purchases because we didn't think the rates were as attractive. In terms of the loan purchases, my recollection is that the Eurohypo portfolio closed beginning to the middle of the quarter and then ING portfolio is closing loan by loan from about the middle of the quarter to the end.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "All right, so there should be some NII pickup in the fourth quarter from those moves I would assume?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Yes, I don't where NII is going to go but over time we certainly want to grow net interest income. And we're hopeful to grow it in the fourth quarter and clearly having those two portfolio close will be beneficial to NII in the fourth quarter.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "And then the follow-up on the efficiency side. I mean 59.1% is outside your range. I know it's just one quarter, but that was the fear, right? You get the mortgage slowdown and the efficiency ratio doesn't look as good, and you made up for it with some other things. But what else can you do outside of mortgage? You mentioned the neighborhood stores. How many of those neighborhood stores do you plan to roll out over two or three years? What's the potential for that? Can you size that which I don't think you've done?", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes, good question, Mike. What we do is test and learn. So we are testing that and learning. There are others on the docket, but we also have an existing 6,200 stores and if I would just take a step back from that, when we put the company together five years ago, we had about 117 million or 118 million square feet. Today, we're down to about 93 million or 94 million square feet and we think we have more offering to go. That's a broad issue around \u2013 the expenses around distribution, not all that's distribution. Of course, that's a top of the house. But within the 6,200 banking store distribution, we are upgrading, creating more density. We are looking at every lease that comes up. So by not only the neighborhood store, which has a big cost advantage and there will be more, we don't how many yet but even with the existing 6,200, we can even look at those things. So every expense that dollar we spend gets considered. It gets considered in of itself and how it relates to revenue. But you're right, we are 59.1 but I think we also said that none of the benefits or very few of the benefits of the mortgage side, the revenue came out immediately and yet the expenses of those 5,300 are not out yet. And plus on top of that, we added $63 million or $65 million to it for a severance reserve that actually made the expenses go up, if you will. So we still think those guardrails make sense. Surely we've touched the high end, but we'll continue to work on that. Also like we said each quarter has its own character. Sometimes revenue comes out right away, expenses trail a bit but we still feel comfortable with those numbers.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "And then lastly, the 94 million square feet, where could that go? Could it go to 80 million, 70 million?", "John G. Stumpf", "It will go down. Again, we continue to challenge our thinking and some things that just give you some ideas of the things that we're thinking about. When we redo stores, we look at density. We look at this whole idea in some cases, hoteling as technology becomes more available and more usable and as our customers spend more time with self-surveying. But the goal here is not to get square footage gone. The goal here is to serve customer in an exceedingly well way, have a great place for team members to come to work and if we can make all that work and have less square feet, then it's a win-win-win. Everybody wins here.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "All right, thank you.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Scott.", "R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill", "Good morning, guys. I guess I just wanted to follow up on some of the credit-related questions. I guess specifically \u2013 I guess what was it this quarter in particular that allowed for such a dramatic reserve release? And I guess the reason I ask is, I certainly understand credit is continuing to improve but there have been other quarters where it's \u2013 in other words it's been improving for a while and in some quarters has been more robust than this quarter even. So I guess number one, what was it for this quarter in particular? And then I guess as I look back over really a decade or more, I think this is by far the lowest absolute level of credit cost you've had in any given quarter despite you being several times larger than at some points there. So has there been any philosophical difference in the way you guys are thinking about the need to reserve or reserve releases, et cetera?", "John G. Stumpf", "I'm glad you asked the question. No change in the philosophy in terms of how we're thinking about reserving. And you're right. I mean $900 million is an increase over the prior quarter. It's not the largest reserve release we've had over last few years, but it is in the last year or so. And I would say it wasn't any one item, it was just a buildup of a number of items. When you think about it, a year ago we had the OCC guidance that we had to adjust to and that clearly would have affected the amount of the reserve release. Then we had hurricane or Superstorm Sandy and there was a concern about what losses might be and so we needed to make sure that we were adequately reserved. And then throughout that same period, we've had a continuation of home price appreciation that I think has surprised everybody. It's amazing \u2013 it seems like every time one of the surveys come out the conclusion is, oh, it can never continue with that rate and then it's just continued. So those are just some examples of why the reserve releases have grown so far this year. I can't promise you that they'll continue to grow, but we do feel very comfortable about the continued improvement in our credit quality. And the other point that I would make is that also it's important to appreciate that the complexion of our loan portfolio is changing. When you look at our commercial loan portfolio, almost half of the loans that are in that portfolio today were originated post-crisis, so 2009 and forward. And somewhere and I don't have the number exact and I apologize, but somewhere plus or minus 45% of the consumer loan portfolio was originated post-crisis. So we're seeing the impact of not only the improvement in credit quality of the pre-crisis portfolio. And John talked about how our consumers and our customer's balance sheets are improving. Also the housing price appreciation is impacting that. But it's also the fact that the new loan portfolio, the post-crisis, the credit quality is just exceptional. So it's a combination of all of that. It's not just one item.", "R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay, all right. Yes, I definitely appreciate the context on it. Thank you.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes, thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "John G. Stumpf", "Hi, Ken.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "Thanks. Hi, John and Tim. I just wanted to ask you a little bit more on the revenue side. I get the context for NII. We know kind of what's happening on the mortgage front. So can you just flush out a little bit? I know you talked about that, some other areas of the business are in fact growing but can you give us a thought about are there any other areas of the fees where you see potential acceleration or increased growth potential that help fill in for the kind of flattish NII and down mortgage trends that we've been seeing off late?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Sure. I mean I would just go back to looking at the year-over-year improvement on that non-interest income slide that we walked through. And what you saw and I wouldn't conclude that any one of these items is going to grow any faster or slower than the others. But what you've seen is a growth in our retail deposit business in terms of fees. That's reflective of the fact that we've had a growth of primary checking account customers which is very exciting to see. We see year-over-year growth in terms of our Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement business on the fee side, both in terms of the brokerage activity but maybe even as importantly if not more importantly in terms of the account base fees are continuing to grow. Investment banking has been a \u2013 has continued to see good growth. Credit card has been growing and so on and so forth. I mean I'm leaving some business out, but the fact of the matter is it's very broad based. So I wouldn't point to any one specific item. As John talked about, we're very excited about credit card but that's not the only area of the company that's growing. So I think it's going to be a number of the businesses that will help fill in any sort of gap over the next few quarters.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "And I guess just within that, Tim, I'm just wondering if there are any businesses, newer businesses that are kind of hitting their post-investment cycle that you've been kind of ramping up, but that could show a better growth rate. I get all your points that you made, but I'm just wondering if there's \u2013 are there things that we haven't seen as much out of that we could see more out of that are just kind of hitting their right pace to their ramp?", "Timothy J. Sloan", "Well, the last time I checked John's expectations of all of my colleagues is that he wants to see growth from all of them.", "John G. Stumpf", "You bet. They all have opportunity to grow. So I wouldn't \u2013 no one is\u2026", "Timothy J. Sloan", "No one gets special treatment.", "John G. Stumpf", "Yes. No one's going to get any special treatment either positively or negatively. Again, there's nothing too new and exciting, it's all exciting.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "Okay. And then last question just on loans again and this quarter you had the purchases, but then there was a little bit core as well. I guess a broader question for you, John, there's the government stuff, there was Syria, there's the Fed, where do you think customers are in terms of their desire to invest in the business, especially in the commercial side? Everyone has been talking about how lame H8 [ph] has been over the course of the last couple of months or so. What does it take to get this \u2013 to break through and what are your customers saying about their desires to take loans out and build their businesses?", "John G. Stumpf", "There is, I would say, guarded optimism. Surely what happens in Washington is not helpful. I have said this for some time. I still think it's about confidence. Think of the great attributes and advantages this country has and we've talked about it before. The best rule or law even though government looks dysfunctional today compared to other places, we wouldn't trade it. We have natural resources. We have an educated workforce. We have a strong financial services industry, the most deepest most transparent on the planet. Housing is getting better. There are just so many advantages. That's why we are so bullish long term. Clearly in the interim, in the intermediate period, as we go through budgets at the national level, federal level and debt ceiling, that's not helpful. But I'm always reminded of our larger shareholder's comments, you don't bet against the U.S. and we have 97% of our revenues here and we couldn't be more excited about the long term. So I'm optimistic, but recognize that we still have ways to go.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company", "Yes. Okay, guys. Thanks very much.", "John G. Stumpf", "Thank you. I'd like to just take this opportunity to thank all of you on the phone and thank our team members. This is now, within a day or two, the five-year anniversary of our \u2013 announcement of our merger with Wachovia. Five years later, we couldn't be more excited about the future. I want to thank all of the 270,000 some team members who come to work every day and make our brand promises come true. So thank you for those of you on the phone and again, thanks to all of our team mates. Have a great day and we'll see you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today during which our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf and CFO, Tim Sloan will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.", "Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim. Happy New Year and thanks everyone for joining us today. 2013 was an outstanding year for Wells Fargo. We generated record earnings, grew loans and deposits, had significant improvement in credit quality and rewarded our shareholders by increasing our dividend and buying back more shares.", "We finished the year with a record $1 in earnings per share for the fourth quarter, our 16th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth, clearly demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model and our success in meeting our customers' financial needs.", "Let me share some of our accomplishments during this past year. We generated earnings of $21.9 billion and earnings per share of $3.89, both up 16% from a year ago. Our core loan portfolio grew by $39.8 billion, almost $40 billion, up 6%. Our credit performance continue to be very strong with total net charge-offs down $4.5 billion, or 50% from just a year ago. Our outstanding deposit franchise continued to generate strong deposit growth, with total deposits up $76.3 billion or 8%.", "By focusing on meeting our customers' financial needs, we achieved record cross-sell across the company, with retail banking cross-sell growing to 6.16 products per household, wholesale banking increasing to 7.1 products and wealth, brokerage and retirement cross-sell achieving 10.42 products.", "We also had very strong returns this year by growing ROA by 10 basis points to 1.151% and return on equity by 92 basis points to 13.87%. We continue to generate strong capital growth with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III increasing to 9.78%. This was a great year for our shareholders. Our stock price increased 33%. We returned $11.4 billion in capital to our shareholders through our higher common stock dividend and more share repurchases in 2013, up 33% from 2012. In our recent CCAR submission, we requested even more capital to be returned to our shareholders.", "As we start the new year, I am excited about the opportunities ahead for our country, for our customers and for Wells Fargo. The unemployment rate has declined, GDP growth accelerated and consumer confidence is near a five-year high. While we don't expect the same rate of home price appreciation we had last year, we do expect the housing market to continue to recover which will benefit the U.S. economy and despite the rise in home prices and interest rates over the past year, housing is still very affordable. During the year ahead, we will continue to build on our commitment to our customers and to our shareholders and invest in our businesses to generate growth for decades to come. I am proud of all that our team members accomplished this past year. Our earnings power and capital strength have never been stronger. We believe we are well-positioned for 2014 and we are optimistic about the many opportunities ahead for continued growth.", "Tim Sloan, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our fourth quarter and full year results. Tim?", "Tim Sloan", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. MY comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on page two and then John and I will answer your questions.", "For the fourth quarter, Wells Fargo earned a record $5.6 billion and $1 in earnings per share, both up 10% from a year ago. These strong results were broad-based with higher net interest income, fee growth across many of our businesses, lower expenses and improved credit quality. We have now achieved 16 consecutive quarters of EPS growth and 11 consecutive quarters of record earnings per share. Our ability to grow over such a long period of time reflects the benefit of our diversified model.", "On slide three, you can see the strong growth in 2013 that John just highlighted, including a 16% increase in full-year net income and earnings per share.", "Slide four illustrates our revenue diversification. We do not rely on any one business to generate growth. The power of our model and the benefit of our diversification were demonstrated in our 2013 results. As interest rates rose during the year, mortgage refi volume naturally waned as expected. As a result, revenue we earned in 2013 for mortgage originations declined $3.4 billion from 2012. However over the same period, we had double-digit fee growth in brokerage, investment banking, cards and mortgage servicing. This diversification enabled us to generate double-digit earnings and earnings per share growth.", "Let me start by highlighting some key drivers of our fourth quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on page five. Our balance sheet has never been stronger. We increased our earning assets by 5% by growing loans, purchasing securities, an increase in short-term investments as deposit growth remained robust. We continued to increase our capital levels even as we returned $3 billion in capital to our shareholders including reducing common shares outstanding by 16.6 million shares in the fourth quarter. The improving economy and high quality loan originations continue to result in improved credit quality with net charge-offs declining to 47 basis points.", "Turning to the income statement on page six. Revenue increased in the fourth quarter as we grew both net interest income and noninterest income. Net Interest income increased while our net interest margin declined 12 basis points. Our ability to grow noninterest income even as mortgage origination volume declined reflects the benefit of our diversified business model. On a linked quarter basis, we had strong fee growth in retail brokerage, trust and investment management, investment banking, card, commercial real estate brokerage, mortgage servicing and insurance.", "Our efficiency ratio improved as expected. Our expenses declined driven by lower personnel costs which were partially offset by seasonally higher fourth quarter expenses for equipment and professional services as we continue to invest in our businesses and addressed evolving compliance and regulatory standards.", "Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on Page 7, we had strong loan growth, with period end loans up $26.2 billion or 3% from a year ago and up $13.5 billion from the third quarter or 7% annualized, with broad-based growth across almost all of our portfolios.", "Our liquidating portfolio continued to decline and is now less than 10% of total loans. This is down from 22% at the time of the merger five years ago as we have reduced the size of this portfolio by $110 billion. Excluding our liquidating portfolio, our core portfolio grew by $39.8 billion, or 6% from a year ago and was up $16.7 billion from the third quarter.", "We have grown our loans on a year-over-year basis for 10 consecutive quarters, and for the past seven quarters year-over-year growth has been at least 3%, despite run-off from our liquidating portfolio.", "On slide eight, we highlight how broad-based our loan growth was in the fourth quarter. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2012, foreign loans grew $9.9 billion or 26% and included growth in trade finance and a UK CRE acquisition we completed in the third quarter. C&I loans were up $9.4 billion or 5% as we successfully grew loans in asset-backed finance, government banking and corporate banking.", "Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $8.6 billion, or 3%, even with the run-off from our liquidating portfolio and included growth in high quality non-conforming mortgages.", "Auto loans were up $4.8 billion or 10%, reflecting record originations in 2013. Credit card balances were up $2.2 billion, or 9% with strong new account growth.", "We generated strong deposit growth throughout the year and growth actually accelerated in the fourth quarter with average deposits growing $34.8 billion or 13% annualized from the third quarter. This growth was diversified across our businesses with strong consumer and commercial growth, while we continue to reduce our deposit costs, which were down five basis points from a year ago to 11 basis points.", "Demonstrating the strength of our deposit franchise, we have successfully grown deposits while reducing our deposit costs for 13 consecutive quarters. We also successfully grew primary consumer checking customers in the fourth quarter, which were up a net 4.7% from a year ago, an increase from 3.9% last quarter.", "As shown on page 10, we grew tax equivalent net interest income from a year ago and from the third quarter. In fact, our NII this quarter was the highest it's been in five quarters. Average earning assets grew $58.3 billion from the third quarter, up 5% reflecting increases in short-term investments, loans and investment securities.", "Our ability to grow net interest income on both, the linked quarter and year-over-year basis, while our NIM declined is why we don't manage to the net interest margin but instead focus on growing net interest income.", "Our NIM declined by 12 basis points from the third quarter to 3.26%. This decline was driven by two primary factors. First, our continued strong customer-driven deposit growth, which has little impact on net interest income, but is dilutive to the NIM, reduced the margin by six basis points.", "The liquidity-related actions we took in the third and fourth quarter in response to increased regulatory liquidity expectations reduced the margin by six basis points. Balance sheet re-pricing and growth and variable income did not impact the NIM in the fourth quarter.", "While the factors that reduced the net interest margin in the fourth quarter were largely P&L-neutral. We expect they will continue to impact the NIM in the near-term. Non-interest income increased $132 million from the third quarter with lower mortgage origination revenue offset by stronger trust and investment fees and higher mortgage servicing revenue. While mortgage banking revenue was down $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter of 2012, we had strong momentum across a number of our other businesses.", "Let me highlight some of the year-over-year increases we had in non-interest income. Trust and investment fees were up $259 million with strong growth in brokerage asset-based fees, growth in our trust and investment business and higher Investment Banking fees. These businesses now account for 36% of our noninterest income, up from 28% a year ago.", "Card fees were up $91 million benefiting from strong account growth and increased usage in both our credit and debit card businesses. Insurance was up $58 million from improved results in our crop insurance business. Deposit service charges were up $33 million from a year ago benefiting from strong account growth and increased treasury management services to our commercial customers.", "As expected, our mortgage origination volume declined this quarter as highlighted on Page 12. We originated $50 billion of mortgages in the fourth quarter, down 38% from $80 billion in the third quarter. Refis declined 32% of origination volume and purchases increased to 68%, a significant mix shift from a year ago and we filed for 65% volume and purchases were only 35%. Our unclosed pipeline declined to $25 billion at the end of the quarter down 29% from the third quarter.", "While still early in the quarter, we currently expect origination volumes in the first quarter to decline from the fourth quarter reflecting seasonality in the purchase market and lower refi volume, but we expect the rate of decline slow from the levels we had in the third and the fourth quarter. Our gain on sale margin was 1.77% in the fourth quarter, up from the third quarter but lower than the historical elevated levels we experienced in the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013. While there are a lot of factors that impact the margin, we currently expect margins in the near term to remain in the range we saw in the second half of 2013.", "Reflecting the lower origination volume we had lower incentive compensation expenses related to mortgage production in the third quarter. We also had lower personnel expenses reflecting a reduction of 5,300 mortgage FTEs we announced in the third quarter and additional reductions of approximately 1,150 FTEs announced in the fourth quarter. The full quarter run rate of these lower FTEs will be reflected in expenses in the first quarter. We reduced our retail mortgage fulfillment FTEs by nearly 50% since our peak staffing levels in the first quarter of 2013.", "Our servicing revenue was up $205 million from the third quarter and up $459 million from a year ago as prepayment speeds have slowed. We announced at the end of the quarter an agreement with Fannie Mae which was fully covered through previously established mortgage repurchase accruals that resolved substantially all repurchase liabilities related to loans originated prior to 2009. Reflecting our agreement with Fannie Mae our outstanding repurchase demands were down 46% from the third quarter to $708 million. As a reminder, we announced last quarter a similar agreement with Freddie Mac. So we have resolved substantially all agency repurchase demands for loans originated prior to 2009. As a result outstanding repurchase demands were down $1.2 billion from a year ago and our repurchase reserve declined $899 million, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2009.", "Expenses were stable from the third quarter, declining $17 million as shown on page 13. Salary expense was down $99 million reflecting lower mortgage banking staffing and severance expense. Incentive compensation expense was down $54 million driven by lower mortgage production revenue partially offset by higher investment banking and retail brokerage activity. A number of our expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter such as equipment expense which was up $96 million due to seasonally higher annual license renewals.", "Our outside professional services increased to $131 million which included higher project related spending on business investments and compliance and regulatory related initiatives. Our efficiency ratio improved to 58.5% in the quarter, down 62 basis points. While we have seasonally higher personnel costs in the first quarter, we will have lower project spending and lower mortgage expenses reflecting a full quarter run rate from reduced staffing. We expect that our efficiency ratio will remain within our target range of 55% to 59% in the first quarter.", "Turning to our business segments, starting on page 14. Community banking earned $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 12% from a year ago and down 4% from the third quarter. Retail banking continued to consistently grow cross-sell, achieving a record 6.16 products per household up from 6.05 products a year ago. Our credit card business continued to have strong results benefiting from seasonality and new account growth. We grew new accounts by 29% from a year ago and household penetration increased to 37%, up from 33% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Purchase volume grew 14% from a year ago. Our auto business had an outstanding year with record originations in 2013, up 26% from a year ago. This strong growth reflects the increase in sales and the benefit of our partnership with GM.", "We remained focused on serving the needs of our small business customers as well. We extended $18.9 billion of new loan commitments to small business customers during 2013, up 18% from 2012 and grew our primary business checking customers by a net 4.7% in the fourth quarter compared to about year ago.", "Wholesale banking earned $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from a year ago and up 7% from the third quarter. These results reflected strong deposit and loan growth, both up 7% from a year ago. Loan growth was broad-based and included strong growth in asset-backed finance, commercial real estate and international.", "Our investment banking business continued to have strong growth with 2013 market share of 5.6%, up from 5% in 2012. This growth reflects the success we have had by focusing on relationships, with investment banking revenue from wholesale banking customers up 22% in 2013, including a 16% increase in revenue from existing, commercial and corporate customers.", "Treasury management revenue was up 8% in 2013, reflecting strong sales growth and pricing increases. We continually invest in this businesses' products and platforms and have been expanding our team of treasury sales experts, because this is an important product for building relationships with our wholesale customers.", "Our asset management business also had an outstanding year in 2013, with total assets under management up 8%, reflecting net client inflows and increased market valuations.", "Wealth, brokerage and retirement earned $491 million in the fourth quarter, up 40% from a year ago and 9% from the third quarter. As you know, this is a business that we have been focusing on and investing in since managing more of our customers' wealth that is an important part of our vision of meeting our customer's financial needs.", "Our results benefited from the improvement in the markets and strong net flows. WBR client assets grew 11% to $1.6 trillion from a year ago. This growth was broad-based and included retail brokerage managed account assets of $375 billion, up 23% and wealth management client assets of $218 billion, up 7%.", "Institutional Retirement plan assets grew 12% from a year ago. We also had strong deposit and loan growth, with average core deposits up 7% and average loans up 12% from a year ago.", "Turning to credit on Page 17, the significant improvement we had in credit quality throughout 2013 continued. With fourth quarter net charge-offs declining to only 47 basis points of average loans.", "Loans in our commercial portfolio were only six basis points and consumer losses declined to 82 basis points. We continue to have strong improvement in our commercial and residential real estate secured portfolios. Our commercial real estate portfolios were once again in a net recovery position as they have been every quarter in 2013.", "Our consumer real estate portfolios continued to benefit from the improvement in the housing market with losses down $918 million or 69% from a year ago. Non-performing assets declined $1.1 billion from the third quarter and were down $4.9 billion or 20% from a year ago.", "Both, commercial and consumer non-accrual loans declined while foreclosed assets increased $135 million from the third quarter, reflecting an increase in government insured foreclosed assets, primarily driven by changes to loan modification programs which slowed foreclosures in prior quarter.", "Reflecting the continued improvement in economic conditions, we had a $600 million reserve release, down $900 million last quarter. Given current favorable conditions, we expect future reserve releases absent a significant [duration] in the economy. We grew our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III, a 9.78% in the fourth quarter, 78 basis points above our internal target of 9%.", "While we have been building capital, we have also been focused on returning more capital to our shareholders. We increased our dividend by 31% in 2013 and purchased 124 million shares. We remain committed to returning more capital to our shareholders and our 2014 capital plan requested an increasing in our dividend and share repurchases compared with our 2013 capital plan. Of course our request is subject to Fed review and nonobjection.", "In summary, our results in the fourth quarter and throughout 2013 were outstanding. We grew loans and deposits, increased our capital liquidity levels and reduced risk as our diversified businesses generated double-digit earnings and EPS growth. In addition we return $11.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. While the future is never certain, we start 2014 in a much better position than we started 2013. The slow and steady growth we had in 2013 positions the U.S. economy for continued growth in 2014. We successfully settled many outstanding issues during 2013 including pre-2009 agency repurchase demands, agency MBS securitization and the independent foreclosure review. We also have more clarity regarding Basel III capital requirements and have taken actions in response to increased regulatory liquidity expectations. We believe that we never been positioned better and we are excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers, our team members and our shareholders.", "We will now open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. Just circling back on the efficiency ratio and, I guess, specifically on the expenses here. As we think about entering 2014, what kind of growth expense base, you have got $12.1 billion roughly, there is some seasonal factor as some of the mortgage cost that need to come out. How should we think about that in a static revenue environment?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, I wouldn't worry about it being a static revenue environment. Our goal is to grow revenues over time and I think we have been able to do that, notwithstanding some of the challenges we have had. Matt, we are really focused as we think about our expenses on revenue efficiency and the efficiency ratio, how much it costs us to deliver a $1 in revenue. We were very pleased to be able to improve our efficiency to 58.5%, again down 62 basis points from the third quarter and down almost 30 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year.", "I think when you think about the fourth quarter efficiency in expenses, we did call out that we had some seasonal expenses that boosted the total expenses in the fourth quarter. We talked about some of the equipment expenses as well as some of the professional fees. As you think about the first quarter, our expectation is that we will be able to operate within our range of 55% to 59% and believe that over the year, we can continue to improve that from the first quarter.", "I do think we will have some benefit in the first quarter from lower seasonal expenses as we mentioned. We will also have some benefit from a lower run rate of expenses in the mortgage business but, overall, again we are very focused on the efficiency ratio and we continue to believe that we can make improvements.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "And this is just a follow-up. Can you remind us what needs to happen to get to the lower end of the 55% to 59%? Obviously it's a range and you can show continued progress but that 55%, will that depend on a materially different macro environment or you can get there executing just what you can control?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, it's a fair point, Matt, because we look at the efficiency ratio, its going to be a function of expense dollars as well as revenue. I think to get to the low end of that range, we will need to see the combination of both, in crew expenses and lower expenses, which we think we can do over time but also with improved revenue. That said, if the revenue takes off and the dollar amount of our expenses are up and our efficiency ratio improves, that's fine too.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Just sneaking a quick one here. On the equity investment book, can you just remind us how big it is and is there any impact from Volcker on that portfolio?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes. A good question. Overall let me answer it maybe a little bit broader question and that is that as we look at the final Volcker rules, there aren't any real significant and material changes that we need to make in any of our businesses to comply. Obviously there is going to be increased reporting and things like that. The only the product business line that's really impacted, which is the [of your] question is the portion of our equity portfolio that's made up of limited partnership investment, that's a little bit less than $2 billion.", "We stopped making those investments a few years ago when the first draft of the Volcker Rule came out and so that portfolio is liquidating down in the normal course. From time-to-time, we could potentially do some sales from that portfolio, but we don't believe that compliance with Volcker and the liquidation of that portfolio in the normal course will have a material impact on our financial results.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi. Good morning, Tim. I was wondering if you could give a little bit of color on the net interest margin and interest income outlook and your thoughts. I think you said you expect some ongoing pressure on the NIM. I am wondering if you could give us some of the puts and takes on that. How does the recent rise in a 10-year yield help you as you reinvest and then where are you on the liquidity actions? Do you still need to pick more there? Obviously, the rules aren't finish, but if you could give us a feel for your progress there.", "Tim Sloan", "I will answer your question in maybe reverse order. Maybe start with liquidity. Let me just step back and frame that a little bit, because you have seen us take some liquidity action in the third and the fourth quarter. Set the rules aside for a minute, and that is that first and foremost, we have got to be able to operate this company with sufficient liquidity to be able to withstand stressed environments both, in terms of an economic downturn as well as an economic expansion. I think, we have been able to demonstrate our success in doing that as we went through the last downturn, so the short answer is that we think that the existing liquidity we have as a company is sufficient to manage the business.", "Having said that, there are a couple of standards that are out there. First, there's is the international standard and I can't comfortably tell you that we have exceeded the international LCR standards. Unfortunately, I can't tell where we stand as it relates to the domestic rules, because they haven't been finalized yet. The NPR was issued in the fourth quarter as you know. It's out for comment right now.", "I think it's fair to say that you generally the current NPR is a little bit more conservative than most of the folks in industry have [got], and so in an anticipation of finalizing the domestic rules, the way that I would think about it is we have changed the complexion of our liquidity and what I mean by that is, we have increased some of our longer term deposits. You saw us do that in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and then we issued some additional debt in the third quarter, so we have made a lot of progress in terms of complying with rules that haven't been finalized yet.", "The other thing that I would mentioned is that, there is a lot of good dialogue that's going on right now in terms of those rules and it's likely that there will be some changes. Then lastly I would point out that our expectation is the compliance period as it relates to those standards, theirs is going to be elongated meeting. We need to get to about 80% compliance by the end of this year, beginning of next year, so a long-winded overview, but I think what we have been able to demonstrate as we have changed the complexion of our liquidity and anticipated the final rules is that we can still deliver record earnings and we can still grow net interest income and that's really good segue into the first part of your question which is the net interest margin.", "The net interest margin was down 12 basis points and the most of that was related to liquidity or deposits as we mentioned. In fact all of that was. Half of it was, we had great deposit growth. You have seen that over the last 16 quarters we have had great deposit growth, long-term that is a terrific thing from our perspective and will take that impact on NIM all day long.", "Then the other half was related to the full quarter impact of liquidity actions that we took in the third quarter plus the liquidity actions that we took in the fourth quarter. So again, a reduction to the NIM but we have been able to grow net interest income.", "So how were we able to do that with the NIM declining? Well, the good news is we had $13.5 billion dollars of point-to-point loan growth which is absolutely terrific. I can't promise you we will have that every quarter but not only is it terrific but results very broad-based, as I mentioned. And then also, our securities did grow and candidly, we are in a much better position today than we were six months ago or a year ago or a year and a half ago in terms of the reinvestment yields that we can achieve today versus the rolloff in the existing portfolio.", "I can't tell you today because of the valley that occurred over last few days but they we will get pretty close. So over time, as we have said over the last few quarters, we believe that we continue to grow net interest income.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, great, and then the second question is on capital return, and John mentioned your request to do more of this year than last year on capital return. When I think back here, April 2012 Investor Day, you laid out a goal for a total payout ratio of a range of 50% to 65%. I was wondering if anything has changed with you now exceeding your Basel III capital targets. Industry asset growth still seems sluggish such that you might reconsider at some point the upper bound of that target and at some point you will stop paying out more than 65% of total earnings?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, it's a fair question. The short answer is no. We haven't changed that range of 50% to 65%. Part of the reason is that we are not at the high end of that range yet. So we are going to take it one step at a time. Clearly, we thought the payout that we had in 2013 was a pretty significant increases as we talked about. On a gross basis, f $11.4 billion. Something that we are very, very proud of and there are, as John mentioned and as I mentioned, our capital plans submission requested an increase from that. So we are hopeful to continue to make progress on that, subject to the Fed review but it is something, John, that we are going to continue to look at. But that that 50% to 65% is not etched in stone forever. It's going to change just like it has changed throughout our history.", "John, I don't know if you --", "John Stumpf", "Yes, I think that's a really important point. It was a year and half when we came up with that. We are still there but those things change over time and as we continue to build liquidity and capital, we are not bound by that. And we are very shareholder friendly here. I think you know and our investors have known it for a long time.", "Tim Sloan", "But, John, I would add, Maybe this is a bit of an advertisement for our Investor Day that's going to be in May. We might change that. So let it be a good reason to come.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, and you are kind of inflecting you are not reducing the share count on a net basis tenure overcoming option issue and things like that. Do you expect that to continue with a net reduction in shares?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes we do. Again, I can't promise it will exactly happen every quarter but my guess is, it probably will. But I think we reached the high point in the second quarter of last year and we have been very clear that our expectation is to continue to reduce that share count. So that's our plan, John.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Good morning.", "Tim Sloan", "Good morning, Erika.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "I just wanted to take a step back. John, Wells Fargo has been able to post pretty good point-to-point loan growth, even with demand in the industry for loans being humdrum. That being said, as we look out to 2014, have we hit an inflection point in terms of loan demand on both the corporate side and the consumer side?", "Tim Sloan", "Inflection, meaning that loan growth is?", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Grown demand in both the corporate side and the consumer side, loan demand didn't start picking up for the industry, generally.", "Tim Sloan", "I think there will be some loan growth at the industry level. I am much more confident about our ability to grow loans, just based on what we have done in the past, what we have done this past quarter. But I will tell you, I am hearing more, when I talk with customers, about their interest in building something, adding something, investing in something. So there is more activity going on, I would say it's going to be a watershed moment, but yes I am optimistic about the economy. I mean, we sit here this January at an economy and frankly as a company in better shape and I have said here in the last five or six Januarys, so, yes, I am [proudly] optimistic about the industry and optimistic about our company able to grow loans and over time grow revenues.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Got it. Tim, in terms of the future impact of incremental liquidity actions, I know the NPR in the U.S. is (Inaudible), but is it fair for us to assume that the bulk of future liquidity actions won't impact your margin as much as the six basis point this quarter?", "Tim Sloan", "I would love to be able to tell you absolutely, but since we don't know what the final rules are, I want to be careful, so I can't give you a specific answer. I think the important thing is, should you have confidence in, A, our ability to move forward to try to anticipate some of those rules and not have it impact our net interest income or our earnings, the answer is yes.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Got it. If I could sneak one last question in here, is it fair for us to look at the 12% quarter-over-quarter drop that the NBIA is forecasting for origination volume and it seems that the drop that Wells Fargo will experience next quarter be similar on a sequential basis?", "Tim Sloan", "I don't know if I would jump to that conclusion. Our mix is a little bit different or can be a little bit different on average compared to the industry in any given quarter. I think it's reasonable to assume that there will be a client because of the impact of just the colder winter months as well as the fact that the volume is really driven much more by purchase activity now than it was by refinanced. We expect the decline but to be specific in terms of the magnitude decline, I don't know what that's going to be.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning, Joe.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "I guess, first is just a follow-up, a clarification from Erika's question. The loan growth in the core portfolio strengthened quite a bit this quarter to $16.7 billion from $8.6 billion. I understand that's fairly broad-based, but how sustainable do you think that is as we go through 2014 here?", "John Stumpf", "Joe, it's a fair question. I think, when you say the 8.6, you are talking about the 8.6 from a year ago?", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "No. The third quarter. Just the sequential core growth in the core loan portfolio.", "John Stumpf", "The good news is that as you mentioned that the growth was very broad-based. Again, in almost every one of our loan portfolios, with the exception of home equity, where we are still originating a good quality home equity loans.", "I don't know if I would take this quarter and say this is what we are going to do every quarter from here on out, I think even last year when you axe out the impact from some of the tax changes that folks were anticipating the fourth quarter can tends to be a pretty strong quarter.", "Our expectation for 2014 is that we are going to grow loans. What rate that will be? I don't know, but certainly the fact that this quarter was so broad-based, I think it is a good indication of our ability to grow loans at a faster rate than we did in 2013. Again, I think the other point to make about loan growth in this quarter is that is that we didn't have any acquisitions driving that growth. This was all organic, not that there is anything wrong with acquisition. We love them, but that was a bigger driver in the third quarter that was in the fourth quarter.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. That's helpful. Then the other question was just, wondering if you could kind of broadly speak about kind of key areas for investment in 2014 and along those lines what are your plans for the branch network given the growth in mobile banking and your recent piloted the neighborhood stores?", "John Stumpf", "Joe, we are making a lot of investments in technology as customers are interested in mobile and in other ways to access us. We still believe that stores are important and we believe that because our customers tell us that, and we do have that pilot that you mentioned and we are assessing that, looking at that. We will build stores this year. I don't think there will be a significant net increase because sometimes we build a new one and we consolidate one or two into that but most of the investments we are going to be making will be in areas like product and convenience for customers.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Yes. Thank you very much. Hi, guys. we know the mortgage market is on a downward trend. It looks the market is down another 25%, but you guys were down more than that, I think north of 30% and now your market share has dropped down to 17% and I also know that you guys have done a lot of refis and a lot of that is the refi side. I know you don't really model the market share but do you see continued declines in that mortgage space?", "Then secondly, do you think that Mel Watt could be a game changer relative to opening up the credit box maybe with some of these going down the FICO score?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, Paul, a good question. We have talked on a number of occasions about how our market share, over the last couple of years was disproportionately high, primarily because the biggest driver for origination volume until the last couple of quarters was refinances, and the reason for that, again to remind everybody, is that we are the largest servicer and the quality of our servicing book was the highest in the industry. So we had many more opportunities than most to be able to meet the needs of our customers by refinancing existing customers, by refinancing their mortgages. So it's not surprising and something that we had been indicating was going to occur as the percentage of refinance volume declined in absolute dollars as well as the percentage of the total decline that our market share would go down.", "I think as we get to a more purchase driven market, we actually think we have got a great opportunity to grow the business because we have the biggest retail network and sales force in the market. So we believe that we can grow over time, but again the focus is not about market share the focus is about generating appropriate revenue, making sure that we are meeting the needs of our customers and doing that very efficiently. So again we are very excited about the transition into a purchase driven market because we got the best team and the largest team that's out there.", "John Stumpf", "Paul, with respect to Mel Watt, we are looking forward to working with him. We know him and I believe he has the same interest we all have, as Americans and as our institution has make mortgage lending and money available to creditworthy, Americans so they can buy houses. He already is digging in. He has put the increase to GP just on hold so he can understand. So we are all looking forward to working with him.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "I mean, do you think the government could make some adjustments there to get the industry to maybe open up the credit box more than it is right now?", "John Stumpf", "Well, I still believe there are some mixed messages coming out of Congress or Washington, I should say, and if we can all get on the same page that would be helpful. I think there some movement happening in that direction, but we will just continue to work on that.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks. Most of my questions have actually been answered. But just following up a little on the mortgage business. You have alluded to us in a couple of different narrations, but given how rapid that decline in refinance has been and it is likely to continue, are there any either other steps that you taking or strategic opportunities that you seek on in the business over the next couple of quarters?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, you know, we announced recently that we are going to be doing some portfolio lending for jumbos and high-end and we have an emphasis on that. And as you know, housing is an uniquely important asset class for Americans and uniquely important for recovery. So no recovery for housing in that play a leadership role and that's part of my optimism for the future and that housing is getting better and that we are seeing more activity on the purchase side, which is really good for America, so we will continue to make complying loans. We are also doing more with respect to our balance sheet.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Is there just anything with respect to kind of integrating it somewhat more directly with the consumer bank?", "John Stumpf", "Well, I will tell you they are really - all hands are on deck there. I don't recall the exact percentage, but it might be 30% or so, but whatever mortgage we do get customer referrals from our bankers, so it's a big card. It's very integrated and actually when you have a purchased money market that actually plays to our strengths, because we are so actively involved with builders, realtors and there is a lot of referral activity that goes on to help serve those customers.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Hi, Mike.", "Tim Sloan", "Hi, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Just first a tactical question, the changes that accretable yield on purchased credit impaired loans, so this is back around page 33, 34, 35 of the news release or in the back section of it, but the drawdown there, the changes in accretable yield, I thought it would be drawn down even a little bit more in the fourth quarter.", "It seems like it's been drawn down a lot year-over-year, but the last quarter it wasn't drawn down a lot. Just conceptually I thought the better credit quality for some of these problem loans, the more you can realize and recover to earnings and it looks like it slowed in the fourth quarter. Can you just give some color on that accounting and what you think?", "Tim Sloan", "Mike, there wasn't any major changes that occurred from an accounting standpoint in the fourth quarter. As you know from time-to-time we have look at the amount of our accretable yield and non- accretable difference and made some adjustments. We did not do that in the fourth quarter, so I would just describe the fourth quarter as just a reflection of just changes within the underlying customer mix. We had more customers that were paying their loans and then paid off, but there was nothing major that occurred in the fourth quarter.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "How can you take a look at that? Because, isn't it the case that with better credit quality that you would tend to realize some gains over time?", "Tim Sloan", "Mike, it's something that we think about and talk about a lot, but from a process point of view, we review it on a quarterly basis to make an affirmative decision in terms of the amount of the non-accretable difference and the non-accretable yield in terms of whether or not we make any changes, but that's the quarterly update that we do.", "John Stumpf", "Mike, you know as we make those determinations it then accretes over the life of the assets, so it's a long event, if you will, over 12, 13,14, years, whatever the life those assets is that how it accretes in.", "Tim Sloan", "I think the important point just to remember is that when you turned the clock back five years ago, I think there was a lot of skepticism in terms of whether or not the right marks were taken at the time of the Wells Fargo and Wachovia combination and then there was a lot of concerns about the portfolio. As you know the accretable yield has actually increased over that period of time, so we have $19.1 billion that's expected to accrete over the remaining life of loans. We are very excited about that.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Then a separate question, so what you can control and what you can't control, let's go to what you can control and that's the economy and you guys had talked about that some. What's the line utilization for commercial or wholesale in the most recent quarter?", "Tim Sloan", "It hasn't really changed a whole lot. It's still about or in the mid-30s, but that wasn't a major driver for loan growth in the quarter. At some point, we will get to the point where there's a little bit more utilization, but that's been pretty stable in the mid-30s.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Then separate from the market share, I know Wells would like to continue to gain. You seem more optimistic on economy, but line utilization hasn't really changed. It sounds like fourth quarter you had some good loan growth, but maybe it won't be quite as strong, seasonally strong, so do you really feel the economy is that much stronger or John, you said the best January in five to six years. Are you thinking next couple of quarters, next couple years? What drives you to that conclusion?", "John Stumpf", "Yes. When I was talking about the best January, that's compared to the five January's. I have sat and had this kind of conversation with you. Our merger is done. Capital liquidity, credit, legal issues, view on regulatory all better. Deposit growth, loan growth, cross-sell, the engagement of the team. So all of those things are better.", "Am I saying there is a full recovery and there is going to be a watershed moment this year? No. I am not saying that but I am saying that uncertainty here, more things from more prospects and customers about buying a car, building a house, starting a business, adding new product lines. There is certainties to at least some that.", "Couple of years, I didn't even hear about that. So its going to be a breakout year but we are going to see steady improvement and that's good for even now as rates rise in response to that which is a normal thing that reduces the refinance volume. The other side of that is improving credit which improves a lot of things. So that's good for America and good for our company over the long-term.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "And then lastly, what you certainly can control. I know you are proud of having 16 quarters in row of higher EPS growth but I down imagine you expect this level of equity investment gains to continue or this level of reserve releases to continue. You called out some seasonal expenses but how do you expect to continue that progression? What should be the main drivers?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, Mike, look, we are not going to promise you that we are going to have a seventeenth consecutive quarter. We hope we do but the fact of matter is the complexion of every quarter is different. We could have that we, and I think we probably did have the same conversation about a year ago, how are we going to be able to grow, and when we think about what the company has accomplished over this last year in the face of a significant backup in interest rates that had a big impact on one of our businesses, we were able to deliver record earnings.", "How were we able to do that? We grew our loans. We grew our investments. We grew our deposits. If you look at noninterest income outside of mortgage origination, we went through a laundry list of five or six businesses and there are more that were up and most of those were up double digits. We have improved our efficiency and John has mentioned we think we can continue to make progress there and credit continues to improve.", "Will we have our loan loss reserve release in the first quarter of $600 million? I don't know. We do think we are going to have future loan loss reserve releases. So the fact of the matter is that what we have been able to demonstrate in the fourth quarter and all of 2013 is our diversified model works even in the face of headwind and as John mentioned it doesn't seem like there is as many headwinds out there than there were a year ago in January.", "So we are very excited of our ability to continue to grow earnings. Whether that means 17, 18 or 19 quarters? I don't know. But over time we are going to grow earnings at this company.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Hi, good morning, guys. On the brokerage businesses, the business this year, the trust and investment fees grew 13% when you have a nice correlation. Just wondering, especially with the lag built-in on some of the pricing of the fee base, how confident do you feel that you can sustain that kind of mid-teens type of growth rate in that part of the company?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, Ken, a good question. I don't know if I would focus on a specific growth rate. We do think we can continue to grow and its going to be a function of the fact there is a little bit of a lag in terms of how the business is priced and paid for. The wealth, brokerage and retirement business has done a great job in terms of increasing the percentage of their recurring fee revenue. I think it's now above 75% and that was the goal that David Carroll set out at our Investor Day a couple of years ago. So we do think we can continue to grow.", "What the growth rate will be? I don't know but in addition, one of the other things that we talked about at Investor Day a couple of years ago was the partnership between the WBR and our retail bank and that partnership continues to work very well from a referral basis. So that business is performing very, very well. Our expectation is that it will continue to grow. I hope that it continues to grow at a double-digit rate, but can't promise you that.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay.", "John Stumpf", "Our expectations are pretty high there, because we are starting from a lower base. And if you look at size of our retail franchise versus the size of the wealth, brokerage and retirement, we have lot of upside. As Tim mentioned, the partnership especially between any bank and Wells Fargo's retirement couldn't be better and there is just tons of opportunity there, so it's opportunity for the company.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. Great. Secondly with regard to the rate sensitivity, you guys did disclose your rate disclosures a little different than most others do and I am just wondering with regards to the liquidity preparation and the changes you have made and you have referred to earlier, how if it all any rules on liquidity side change at all your assets sensitivity when and if you someday we get the front-end moving? Maybe I will just leave it there.", "John Stumpf", "Good question. Really given the amount of liquidity build that we had in the third quarter, it didn't have a material impact on our total balance sheet. Did effect net interest margin as we mentioned, so it really doesn't have a big impact on our interest rate sensitivity. I mean, we have experienced that the biggest impact that we could have to the company from an interest rate sensitivity standpoint when you think about the impact that we had in the third and fourth quarter from the rate rise in the impact on the mortgage business, we are very sensitive to a rise in the short rate which I know everybody believes will never happen, but some day it will and that will be beneficial to us.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. Great. Then last just quick question. The tax rate has been running a little bit lower. Do you have any thoughts on just what we should be thinking about as far as the future tax rate? Thanks, guys.", "Tim Sloan", "Yes. The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30.9%. That was a little bit higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Our expectation for this year is that our tax rate will be plus or minus what has been this year. Maybe just a little bit higher, but I guess not that it shouldn't have a material impact on our results.", "Jim Rowe", "Regina, we will begin with the next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Good morning, John and Tim. How are you?", "John Stumpf", "Hi. Chris. How are you doing?", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "I am doing well. Happy New Year.", "John Stumpf", "Happy New Year.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Just two quick follow-up questions on the professional services cost that you highlighted being about 130 or so million higher on a sequential quarter basis. Then you broke that into different kind of buckets project spending and then also compliance and maybe regulatory related spend. Can you breakdown those two different buckets that calls the $130 million increase? Then just as a follow-up, how much of the compliance and regulatory related part of that is permanent or is not permanent?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes. Some really good question. One of the challenges that we have is that some of the investment that we are making, say, for a project impacts both is the investment in the business but also it's going to have a regulatory or compliance nature to it, so I don't have any detail handy to break that down, but it's not exactly how we think about it.", "I will tell you that as we mentioned last quarter that our compliance and regulatory costs are up year-over-year and we are in the process right now of making sure that we got the best risk managed the company in the industry, so there will be some continued investment that we will need to make there.", "Having said that, how much of that is permanent and how much is kind of a one or two time-type investment, I don't have an answer for you, so I apologize for not being able to provide some real specifics there, but again to repeat I do think you will see a decline in the professional services line in the first quarter.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Okay. That's fair enough. A separate question. The net charge-off ratio was pretty stable with third quarter. I was kind of wondering did you think we finally has have had four on that ratio or could there have been some year-end cleanup in fourth quarter that would lead you to believe that maybe the charge-offs could go even lower in the first quarter.", "Tim Sloan", "I don't know for sure. Here's the way I would think about it. I will give you two numbers that made up the 47 basis points. The losses that we had in our commercial portfolio were about six basis points. We think we have got a great team that's very good at making loans on the commercial side but having a loss rate of six basis points is probably not something that's going to happen forever. So I think there's, probably over time, not necessarily in the first quarter, some pressure there.", "On the other hand, the losses in our consumer portfolio were about 82 basis points. Now when you think about the composition of the consumer portfolio, clearly, there is some portion of that portfolio that's going to have higher loss rates like credit card. That's an area that we are building over time.", "On the other hand, when you look at some of the other consumer businesses, we are not originating loans today that are going to generate 82 basis points of loss in the next year or two years. We are originating high quality loan. So my guess is there is probably a little bit more pressure over time and the commercial loss rate to go up and the consumer loss rate could go down. Again when you look at that 82 basis points, the disproportionate share continues to come from our home equity portfolio which among all the portfolios is really benefiting from the improvement in underlying residential real estate values.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Securities.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners", "Hi, I wanted to ask you two lines of questioning. First, on the share count. If you look at the repurchase volume that you have been able to do, share count is holding relatively flat. I was curious if you thought, as you increased repurchase going forward, do you think the share count can start to come down? And then, I wanted to ask you one more question about that.", "Tim Sloan", "Marty, in fact the share count has been down from the high in the second quarter of last year and the short answer to your question is, yes. The primary driver there is going to be the level of our share repurchases. We increased our share repurchases this year over last year. We have submitted a capital plan which calls for a request for more share repurchase. So the short answer again is, yes. We think we can bring that down over time.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners", "The impact of equity compensation, would you think the dilution that you do have that offsets some of the share repurchase. Would that be more from issuance or more from market price appreciation?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, it's a complicated answer to a straight forward question and recall that we changed our options program a couple of years ago or a few years ago. So the impact of that is going to decline. On the other hand, we will continue to have a good portion of our incentive compensation around here based upon our equity because we believe that that aligns our team members with our shareholders.", "So the fact that that is there is very important to us and hopefully, you will appreciate it's important to you but I don't imagine that that's going to have a significant change to the share count calculation. The primary driver there is going to be our ability to repurchase more shares and, again, we think we can increase that over time.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners", "Okay, other kind of area I want to delve into was asset sensitivity. Earlier questions were kind of starting to allude to that but as you have seen this outsize deposit growth that you have been able to attract, you have been really pushing that more and more into cash. So that does make you more asset sensitive than probably your just overall measure with look and then also as longer term rate start to go up, you can begin to be able to restructure the portfolio a little bit. You have got excess capital. There is going to be some opportunities to accelerate asset sensitivity by restructuring as well. So just thought you could think about a few of those kind of tactics or other things that might make you be more asset sensitive than you look on the cover of your reports.", "Tim Sloan", "Well, you are absolutely correct. We are very asset sensitive. The disproportionate share of our loan portfolio is floating-rate in an environment where the short-end of the curve starts to increase which, at some point it will. We believe that that will be a net addition to revenues because our loans will probably reprice faster than our deposits. You have seen that before with Wells Fargo in prior cycles.", "In terms of the investment portfolio, you are also correct, in that given the back up in rates and the current yields that we are getting off our portfolio, we can get much more attractive returns that are more or less about what the runoff is right now. Not exactly, but as rates continue to rise, it's going to make those returns even more attractive and we will get some benefit from a revenue standpoint there, so we think we are positioned fairly well for the environment that we are likely to be in over the next few years which is in the short-term probably an increase in the long end of the curve. I don't know by how much, but it probably will increase. Then in the next year to two years an increased short end.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners", "Then lastly, John, you mentioned the mortgage portfolio and increasing the volume there. With the GDPs going up here shortly, especially on a higher quality customers, those low GDPs historically have pushed us to origination and servicing versus portfolio and mortgages, but it seems like you are really looking at that as an opportunity, especially with the steep yield curve to add some assets plus value especially as mortgage rates relatively adjusted to these new GDPs.", "John Stumpf", "That's right. My understanding is the latest increase in GDPs is the one that would suggest it has actually been put on a hold for a bit, but absent that yes, we think there is opportunity here to serve a customer base through portfolio lending and we have done that for a long time, but there's opportunities here and we sure want to serve that customer base.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners", "Thanks.", "John Stumpf", "Thanks, Marty.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "Hi.", "John Stumpf", "Hi, Keith.", "Tim Sloan", "Hi, Keith.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "I just wanted to ask what's your home price assumptions as you think about sizing the mortgage business and on the credit side as well, what do you assume for home prices for '14?", "John Stumpf", "We think probably a lot where most economists are in the range of 3% to 5% increase if you look broadly. Now I think what you are seeing is some more regionalization going on in residential real estate, so I mean I live in San Francisco. It's been stronger here than for example than in the Central Valley, but housing is getting better generally everywhere but I think 3% to 5% is a pretty safe range.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "Okay. Then just going back to the payout ratio specifically on dividends, you were right at 30% for 2013 on dividend payout. As you think about approaching this year's CCAR, what are you comfortable with on the dividend payout ratio? I know, above 30% gets you extra scrutiny. How do you think about the dividend payout?", "John Stumpf", "Well, I can just repeat what Tim and I have said is that the submission is in. It's our request to do more on dividends and repurchase. It's in with the fed right now. We will all know here in another six weeks or so, so let's just wait for that time and see when that comes out.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining us, I very much appreciate your interest in our company and the questions and we will see you next quarter. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo first quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Great. Thank you, Regina and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf and our CFO, Tim Sloan will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn our call over to our John Stumpf, Chairman and CEO.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We earned a record earnings per share of $1.05 in the first quarter, which was our 17th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. Wells Fargo's ability to grow consistently across a variety of economic and interest rate environments demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model and our unwavering focus on our vision of meeting all of our customers' financial needs and helping them succeed financially.", "Our financial results have strong capital generation and returning more capital to our shareholders has remained a priority. We are extremely pleased that our 2014 capital plan allows us to increase our common stock dividend by 17% subject to Board approval, of course and also increase our common stock repurchases in 2014. We are proud of the fact that we have been able to increase our dividend and share repurchases every year since 2011, while we have continued to grow our capital levels.", "Let me now highlight our growth during the quarter, compared with a year ago. We generated earnings of $5.9 billion and EPS of the $1.05, both up 14% from a year ago. We had strong and broad-based loan growth, up $28 billion or 4%. Our credit performance continued to improve with total net charge-offs down $594 million or 42% from a year ago and net charge-offs were only 41 basis points of average loans this quarter.", "Our outstanding deposit franchise continued to generate strong growth with total deposits up $83.8 billion or 8%. We deepened relationships across our company, achieving record retail banking cross sell of 6.17 products per household. Wholesale banking increased cross sell to 7.2 products and wealth brokerage and retirement cross sell was 10.42 products.", "We remain focused on reducing expenses with our efficiency ratio declining to 57.9%, down 40 basis points from a year ago. We increased our returns, growing return on assets by eight basis points to 1.57% and return on equity by 76 basis points to 14.35%. We continued to generate strong capital growth with our estimated common equity Tier 1 under Basel III advance approach which was over 10%.", "Our results not only demonstrate the strength of our diversified business model but also the benefit of an improving economy. While economic growth during the first quarter was uneven, economic activity improved later in the quarter, including national auto sales, which reached a seven-year high in March. Employment also increased in March for the 42nd consecutive month, one of the longest periods of sustained growth ever and consumer confidence hit a six year high. The housing recovery remained on track and should benefit from the spring buying season.", "I am optimistic about future economic growth, because consumers and businesses have continued to improve their financial conditions. Households have reduced their leverage to the lowest level since 2001 and the burden of their financial obligations is lower than at any time since the mid-1980s. Also businesses are well-positioned to hire and invest with ample supplies of cash. As always, Wells Fargo is ready to help all of our customers to meet their financial needs through our diversified product line and financial advice.", "I want to conclude by highlighting the management changes we announced last week. Dave Hoyt who has been with Wells Fargo for over 32 years is retiring in June. Dave and his exceptional team of leaders have built a wholesale banking business, which is well-positioned for continued growth. Tim Sloan, who you all know has been an excellent d financial and strategic leader for Wells Fargo and had previously spent 22 years in the wholesale banking group and is perfectly suited to continue wholesale banking's commitment to serving customers as he becomes the head of wholesale banking.", "John Shrewsberry will join me as CFO on our earnings call next quarter, who has deep understanding of our financial and business operations as well as our shareholder expectations through his 20 years of proven leadership including heading Wells Fargo securities, with responsibility for investment banking, capital markets trading and investment research businesses. John will be supported in his new role by a strong and talented finance team. These changes demonstrate the deep bench of high caliber leaders at Wells Fargo, which I believe is the best team in banking.", "Tim will now provide more details on our first quarter. Tim?", "Tim Sloan", "Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on page two. John and I will then answer your questions.", "Wells Fargo earned a record $5.9 billion in the first quarter, up 5% from the fourth quarter. Our record earnings per share of $1.05 was also up 5% from last quarter. This was our 17th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth and our 12th consecutive quarter of record EPS, reflecting the benefit of our diversified business model.", "As John highlighted and as you can see on page three, we had strong year-over-year growth in the fundamental drivers of our business in commercial and consumer loans, deposits, cross sell, credit, expense management, which resulted in growth in net income, capital and earnings per share and produce higher returns on assets and equity. I will highlight the drivers of our growth which create long-term value for our shareholders throughout the call.", "Page four highlights our revenue diversification, which is once again evenly split between net interest income and non-interest income. The drivers of our fee income, however, can differ depending on the interest rate and economic environment. For example, mortgage originations were 6% of our fee income this quarter, down from 23% a year ago, when the refinance market was strong. Other businesses such as equity investments, brokerage and mortgage servicing contributed more to fee income this quarter demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model.", "Let me start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our first quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on page five. We had strong linked quarter growth in both loans and deposits. We are especially pleased with this performance since first quarter is generally a seasonally weaker quarter for growth. Loans increased $4.1 billion from the fourth quarter after increasing only $392 million on a linked quarter basis a year ago.", "Deposits grew by $15.4 billion compared with $7.9 billion on a linked quarter basis a year ago. The improving economy and high quality loan originations continued to benefit credit quality with net charge-offs declining to 41 basis points.", "Turning to the income statement on page six. Net interest income declined as we expected, reflecting the two fewer days in the quarter and lower income from variable sources. Non-interest income increased in the quarter, reflecting higher retail brokerage asset-based fees, mortgage servicing income and market sensitive revenue. This growth was partially offset by seasonally lower deposit service charges and card fees and lower mortgage production revenue.", "Our expenses declined from the fourth quarter. While we had seasonally higher personnel expenses, we had lower deferred compensation expense, salary expense and revenue-based incentive compensation. Equipment, professional services and advertising expenses, all declined from elevated levels in the fourth quarter.", "Our results this quarter included a $423 million discreet tax benefit primarily from a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the resolution of prior period matters with state taxing authorities. This lowered our income tax expense by $227 million compared with last quarter and reduced our effective income tax rate to 27.9%.", "Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page seven, we continued to have strong loan growth in the first quarter, our 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Period end loans were up $28 billion or 4% from a year ago. Our liquidating portfolio continued to decline, down $12.8 billion from a year ago and down $2.9 billion from the fourth quarter. Excluding our liquidating portfolio, our core portfolio grew by $40.8 billion or 6% from a year ago and was up $7 billion from the fourth quarter.", "On page eight, we highlight how broad-based our loan growth continued to be. C&I loans were up $12.7 billion or 7% from a year ago as we successfully grew loans in asset-backed finance, corporate banking and government and institutional banking. Foreign loans grew $7.2 billion or 18% from a year ago, reflecting growth in trade finance and the U.K. CRE acquisition we completed in the third quarter.", "Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $7.2 billion or 3% with growth in high quality nonconforming mortgages. Auto loans were up $5.3 billion or 11%, reflecting increased auto sales and record originations. Credit card balances were up $1.9 billion or 8%, with record new account growth.", "Deposit growth also remained strong in the first quarter with average deposits growing $91.1 billion or 9% from a year ago and up $16.9 billion from the fourth quarter. This increase reflected solid growth across our businesses, particularly our consumer businesses and an increase in liquidity related term deposits.", "Primary consumer checking customers were up 5.1% from a year ago, up from 4.7% in the fourth quarter. We have steadily increased the growth rate of this higher cross sell more profitable customer base over the past four quarters through product enhancements and consistent focus.", "As shown on page 10, tax-equivalent net interest income increased $157 million from a year ago, even though our net interest margin declined 29 basis points, reflecting the benefit of lower funding costs. Net interest income declined from the fourth quarter as expected, primarily from two fewer days in the quarter and lower variable income.", "Our net interest margin declined by seven basis points from the fourth quarter to 3.2% driven by three primary factors. Lower income from variable sources reflecting lower PCI resolutions reduced the NIM by four basis points, customer driven deposit growth reduced the NIM by two basis points and the liquidity actions that we took in the fourth quarter in response to increased regulatory liquidity expectations reduced the margin by one basis point.", "While our deposit growth and liquidity actions reduced our NIM, they had minimal impact on net interest income. Like last quarter balance sheet repricing and growth did not impact the net interest margin this quarter. Growing net interest income remains our focus and we believe we should be able to grow net interest income throughout the remainder of the year.", "Non-interest income increased $148 million from the fourth quarter with lower mortgage origination revenue offset by stronger equity gains, mortgage servicing revenue and brokerage fees. Compared with a year ago, non-interest income declined $750 million primarily reflecting lower mortgage banking results. Non-interest income excluding mortgage banking was up $534 million from a year ago with growth across many of our businesses, including brokerage, trust and investment management, credit and debit card, commercial real estate brokerage and equity investments.", "Our equity gains have steadily increased over the past year, reflecting good operating performance in our portfolio and the benefit of strong public and private equity markets. We have been in equity related businesses for over 50 years. Like the other businesses at Wells Fargo, these businesses which are permitted under the Volcker Rule have experienced management teams that have produced strong results for decades. Our equity gains this quarter reflected roughly the same number of transactions as last quarter but our gains per investment were higher benefiting from positive market conditions.", "Our mortgage results in the first quarter reflected the expected decline in origination volume. We originated $36 billion of mortgages down $14 billion from the fourth quarter. Our unclosed pipeline increased to $27 billion at the end of the quarter and we expect a normal seasonal benefit of a stronger purchase market in the second quarter to drive origination growth.", "Our gain on sale margin was 1.61% in the first quarter within the range of the margins we saw in the second half of 2013. We also continue to see improvement in our net servicing results where servicing revenue up $229 million from the fourth quarter.", "As shown on page 12, expenses were down $137 million from the fourth quarter and down $452 million or 4% from a year ago. We also improved our efficiency ratio to 57.9%. Our first quarter expenses included $440 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as $221 million in annual equity rewards for retirement eligible team members.", "While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense reflecting day count and the impact of our annual merit increases and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter, such as outside professional services and advertising expenses are expected to increase in the second quarter. We also plan to continue to invest in our businesses and revenue-based incentive compensation expense could increase as businesses grow. However, we expect our efficiency ratio to remain within our target range of 55% to 59% in the second quarter.", "Turning to our business segments, starting on page 13. Community banking earned $3.8 billion in the first quarter, up 31% from a year ago and up 19% from the fourth quarter. Retail banking continued to grow cross sell, achieving a record of 6.17 products per household, up from 6.1 products a year ago, while mobile banking continued to be our fastest-growing channel with 12.5 million active mobile customers up 23% from a year ago. Store traffic has remained strong with teller transaction stable from a year ago, despite decreases in geographies that experienced severe winter weather during the quarter.", "Our credit card business grew balances and fee income compared with a year ago, reflecting record new account growth up 6% from the first quarter of 2013. Purchase volume grew 14% from a year ago and household penetration increased to 38%, up from 34% a year ago. We continue to be the number one auto lender in the country, with record originations in the first quarter of $7.8 billion, up 15% from a year ago.", "Wholesale banking earned $1.7 billion in the first quarter, down 15% from a year ago and down 17% from the fourth quarter. This decline was primarily driven by lower PCI resolutions and investment banking revenue and seasonally higher expenses. Wholesale banking continued to generate strong loan growth, up 7% from a year ago and up 2% from the fourth quarter.", "The linked quarter growth was broad-based with corporate banking growing $2 billion from new loan growth and higher utilization rates from our energy and large corporate and institutional customers. The asset-backed finance portfolio increased $2 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher utilization rates on warehouse lines and the commercial real estate portfolio grew $1.8 billion from the fourth quarter driven by higher utilization rates on construction loans and new loan originations.", "Credit quality remained exceptional with $59 million in net recoveries for the quarter. Wholesale banking has had net recoveries for five consecutive quarters, reflecting our conservative risk discipline and improving market conditions. Cross sell increased to a record 7.2 products per relationship, up from 6.8 a year ago. Treasury management continued to be a key relationship building product with revenue up 4% from a year ago, driven by strong sales growth, growth in commercial card volume and pricing increases.", "Wealth, brokerage and retirement earned $475 million in the first quarter, up 41% from a year ago and down 3% from the fourth quarter. We understand the importance of investing and saving for the future, which is why we are focused on offering our customers sound guidance and advice. Our brokerage advisory assets have grown to $388 billion, up $63 billion or 19% from a year ago. Revenues from advisory assets increased 25% from a year ago and recurring revenues are now 80% of WBR revenues up from 74% a year ago. Wealth brokerage retirement also had strong loan growth with average loans up 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by high quality nonconforming mortgage loans.", "Turning to page 16. Credit quality continued to improve with first quarter losses down $138 million from the fourth quarter and net charge-offs declining to 41 basis points of average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only one basis point of average loans and consumer losses declined to 75 basis points. Nonperforming assets have declined for seven consecutive quarters and were down $840 million from the fourth quarter. We had a $500 million reserve release in the quarter and we continue to expect future reserve releases absent the significant deterioration in the economy.", "We also continue to focus on strong capital generation and believe the most important measure of our capital strength is the estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach, fully phased in, our ratio grew to 10.04%, up 28 basis points from last quarter. Although we repurchased 33.5 million common shares in the first quarter, the amount of shares outstanding at the end of the quarter was up due to annual employee benefit plan issuances.", "As John mentioned at the beginning of our call, our 2014 capital plan included an increase in share repurchase activity compared with 2013 activity and we expect our share count to decline in the second quarter and throughout 2014 as a result of our anticipated share repurchases. Also during the first quarter, our Board approved an additional 350 million shares in our repurchase authority. Our 2014 capital plan also included a proposed dividend of $0.35 per share for the second quarter, subject to Board approval, an increase of 17% over the $0.30 per share we paid in the first quarter.", "At our last Investor Day in 2012, we provided a target payout ratio of 50% to 65%. We look forward to revisiting this target at our next Investor Day on May 20 in San Francisco.", "In summary, our consistent EPS growth reflects the advantages of our diversified model. Our results in the first quarter benefited from good loan growth and good deposit growth, improved credit quality and lower expenses. Our capital levels continued to grow, while we returned to $2.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are optimistic that the continued improvement in the economy and the focus of our team members on meeting the financial needs of our customers will continue to produce strong results.", "We will now open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. One, just on the LCR, I know you mentioned, that the LCR related bills hit the NIM by one basis point in the quarter. So just wanted to get a sense as to how far along you think you are and how much more you need to do to get to either 100% or whatever cushion you are going to run over 100%?", "Tim Sloan", "Sure. Betsy. That's a really good question. You saw us in the third and fourth quarter in particular make a number of decisions where we raised the liquidity in a number of ways to try to anticipate where the domestic LCR would ultimately land. I think the problem that I have got in terms of or a challenge we have in terms of giving a specific answer to the question is we don't know what the final rules look like yet. But rest assured that we think we have adequate liquidity to operate the company and we don't anticipate whatever the final rules are, that it's going to have a material impact on the company.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, so don't be surprised if we have a couple of more basis points coming out but it's not going to be much more than that. Is that a fair way of thinking about it?", "Tim Sloan", "I wouldn't necessarily equate it to net interest margin. Clearly the impact of our liquidity build this quarter was much less than in the fourth quarter in particular but again it's going to be a function of what the final rules look like and those are in flux right now. But again, I don't believe it's going to have a material impact on the net income of the operations in the company.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Got it, okay and then just secondly on mortgage. The basic question is, how are you thinking about the go-forward from here? You did indicate that weather related was tough in 1Q and we do have a seasonal pick up with purchase activity in 2Q but going in to the year, I think you know the industry was thinking that mortgage originations would be somewhere between the 1.1 and 1.3 in terms of the (inaudible) dollars origination and you have some capacity in your mortgage origination business to potentially take some share in that environment. Do you see that we are going to be a materially lower levels origination for the full-year? Have you adjusted your expenses for that? At this stage I saw you cut back in headcount a little bit in the quarter and maybe if you could speak to what the plans are for that over the next quarter or two?", "Tim Sloan", "Sure. I will jump in and then John may want to follow-up. The first thing is that when you look at our mortgage business, it was it was profitable, both on an origination and the servicing side which we are very pleased with. Mortgage is an important business for Wells Fargo. We have been in it for decades. We have been through cycles.", "Our mortgage team is poised and ready to take advantage of a stronger selling season. You can see that we entered the quarter with a slightly increased portfolio and pipeline, which we are very excited about but again, when you look at the fundamental drivers of the mortgage business and that is, rate still historically are very low, the affordability index is very attractive and consumer debt is coming down as well as employment continues to increase. So we are optimistic. I don't know what the size of the market will be but I know that our mortgage team is poised and ready to take advantage of opportunities.", "John, I don't know if you are going to --", "John Stumpf", "Sure. Yes. I would just add a couple of things to that. We are optimistic. Housing continues to improve. I don't think we will see the percentage increases in values this year that we saw last year but we believe it to be positive. I don't know if this is going to be in the 4% or 5%, which is kind of the consensus but as I travel around the country, there is a lot of enthusiasm about housing. And just because of the mortgage, you know, who knows where the mortgage market will be, there is frankly a lot more cash buyers today, to be honest about it. So housing is better and a bigger share of our origination, say, are purchase money, which is actually a healthy place to be and when you think of the sales force, the team that we have and all referrals coming out of our store channels and other places, this really plays to our wheelhouse. So we are excited about it and weather did have some impact but we are excited about the selling season.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "I guess I am just interested to see how some job cuts in mortgage this first quarter --", "John Stumpf", "Well, we are all interested in seeing that.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "All right. That's not an indication that you are too optimistic going into year?", "Tim Sloan", "No. We are adjusting. It's a big business and we are always looking at how to get more efficient, of course and making sure that we have the right number of team members but we are ready for whatever comes and if its not as good, we will make adjustments. If its better, we will make adjustments that way. We have been nimble on our feet for decades in that business.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Yes. Okay, thanks.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thanks, Betsy.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Good morning.", "Tim Sloan", "Hi, Erika.", "John Stumpf", "Hi, Erika.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Thanks much for the clarity on the share count outlook. I do want to pose a question though on the 350 million share repurchase authority that I have been getting from investors. How should we think about the catalyst that will drive the pace at which you use up this authority over the next few years?", "John Stumpf", "So Erika, the way that I would describe it is that and think about it and step back for a second, we returned $11.4 billion to our shareholders last year. We are going to return more than that this year. In terms of the specifics of how that's going to play out on any given day, in a month or within a quarter, we don't have a specific plan in place that we are going to execute but we would tell you that we think our shares are on sale every day and we are going to repurchase more shares this year than we did last year and you are going to see that share count go down in the second quarter, in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Great.", "John Stumpf", "And the reason we can do that is because the earnings of the company. So just think about it. And that's the fundamental driver here.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "And so, as a follow-up to that, you are clearly an earnings machine and you have plenty of excess capital anyway you measure it. I am wondering, John, could you update us on how you are thinking about what potential acquisition opportunities there could be in terms helping enhance particularly some of your fee businesses?", "John Stumpf", "Sure. We don't need to do anything. That's the beauty here but we are always looking at things in an opportunistic way. The biggest capital required acquisitions or the ones that use the most capital are deposit businesses. We are, of course, at a level now where we are ready at the capital overhead. So the things that we look at are, is there a way to enhance wealth brokerage retirement possibly and that would be interesting to us. Portfolio purchases. We announced something with Dillard's recently. So these are the kind of things that we like doing. We like the card business. What were doing, if there can be an add here or there. So I would think of it as bolt-on businesses and not think of it in the way of transformational but again, if we don't do anything that's also fine.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Great. Thank you for answering my questions.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Erika.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you, Erika.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi. Good morning, guys. Couple of quick questions, Tim. One or two nitpicks on net interest income. How much did the day count hurt NII dollars in the first quarter? And then when you say that you think you can grow net interest income for the rest of the year, I assume you mean starting from the 1Q starting point? Is that a good way to read what your comment was there?", "John Stumpf", "John, that's correct. So from the first quarter starting point, we believe that we are going to grow net interest income throughout the year, similar to what we did last year. The impact of a couple of days was somewhere in the $120 million to $130 million range for the quarter.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay and then in terms of investing cash, with rates coming down this quarter, it doesn't look like you did too much deployment this quarter. Could you just comment on that? There was some movement in held-to-maturity investments. It looked like they went up but can you just comment on what happened this quarter on cash deployment?", "Tim Sloan", "Sure. The good news is that the first call in cash department is always for loan growth and you saw good loan growth year-over-year and on a sequential quarter basis. So we were very excited about that. But you are right. Rates have been pretty volatile this quarter. There have been times during the quarter, when they were more attractive from our perspective and we did accelerate some of investments. Most of the purchases that we made in the quarter, which were about $13 billion on a gross basis, were in the held-to-maturity category and we have specifically purchased some more treasuries. Every quarter has a little bit different complexion. You have seen us be more aggressive and you saw us be more aggressive, for example, in the third and fourth quarters of last year. We will continue to invest our excess liquidity in a very appropriate way but you are right, rates are little bit lower than that we find attractive today.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay and then on the volatile sources, where are we on that this quarter? Is there a multi-quarter average or normalish that you could compare whether those volatile sources below average this quarter? Is there any way to contextualize that?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, the variable income, particularly related to PCI resolutions was, I would say, above average in the fourth quarter. This quarter, if there is such an average for a volatile item, which is hard to work, to be honest, is a little bit of a challenge but I would say this quarter is a little bit more typical than what we have seen in other items in the variable category like loan fees and resolutions and things like that. But the fourth quarter was just a little bit higher and this feels a little bit more typical.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay and then can you have any comment on where you are in preparations for the OLA? I know the rules aren't finished yet but is there any quantification of available bail-in resources or what level of potential requirement you might be preparing for to help us think how far along you are?", "Tim Sloan", "Sure. Again, it's similar to the LCR question and that is, we don't know what the final rules look like yet. We are hearing the same things that you probably are, that its going to be based on the required level of Tier 1 common equity here in the U.S. and then some sort of metric that is going to be reflective of risk in the underlying companies. I mean, the good news is that our business model is a little bit less risky than others and that I think should benefit us. Based upon what we are hearing, we don't anticipate any significant changes in the level of our long-term debt but having said that, I don't know what the final rules are going to be. My understanding is that they could be released sometime this quarter, could be next quarter. We will adjust. I wouldn't anticipate it having a material impact on the operations of the company.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay and then last thing for me. Just on reserve releases, can you give us underneath the service, what's driving the reserve release in terms of categories? I assume there is not much that you are releasing out of the commercial book anymore. Is it really, to the extent you see further reserve releases, is it coming out of mortgage and home equity?", "John Stumpf", "I would say, John, it's predominantly but not completely consumer driven. You have seen and its just a reflection of the fact that the underlying credit quality of the company continues to improve. When you think about the quality of the loans that we have originated post-crisis, the loan losses, credit quality are very, very good. And so our expectation is that while our loan loss reserve release was down this quarter from the prior quarter and from the prior quarter before that, we do anticipate future releases but its primarily consumer driven.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks. You had alluded to, Tim, before the idea of bolt-on type acquisitions. Is there like a maximum size that you would think about in portfolio acquisitions and if its what used to be thought of as a specialty finance business but has perhaps like internet based deposits, does that qualify as a bank? Does that restrict you? How do you think about those two questions, as it relates to the acquisition possibilities?", "Tim Sloan", "Moshe, I don't think there would be any difference in how we review internet-based deposits versus more traditional deposits. Deposits are going to be viewed as deposits. And as John mentioned, it's not a business that we can buy. Clearly we have adequate capital to run our business and excess capital, which we primarily want to return to our shareholders. So we have the capacity to do a relatively large acquisition.", "However, our focus is going to continue to be on running the business. As John said, we don't really need to do an acquisition to continue to grow. If you look at some of the sizes of the acquisitions that we have done over the last few years, the largest have been portfolio acquisitions. I think the largest was $4 billion, $4.5 billion. So we can clearly do something of that size and really not miss a beat.", "Could we do something a little bit larger than that? Sure we could but as you know, we are pretty discriminating in terms of what we want to acquire. So I wouldn't anticipate us making any big splash in the near future.", "John Stumpf", "Yes, let me just make sure we are all on the same page here. Tim's absolutely right. Our best opportunity to increase shareholder value is run our existing businesses even better. We have huge opportunity. We have this diversified business model, this culture. 97% of revenues are here in the U.S. It's still a very fragmented market. This is where the opportunity is and we don't need to do anything. If we do, it would be clearly accretive and it would look opportunistic to you and to us but our focus on running the business.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Great and one of the things on the mortgage side that trade press has said a lot about, is that basically a lot of the origination growth has come in the non-banks. Could you talk a little about your strategies just from a market share standpoint given that there has been this growth coming from outside of the traditional banking industry?", "Tim Sloan", "I think it's a fair point. We are not overly concerned about, though obviously we have got to be cognitive of our competition and the reason for that is, we have the best distribution in the entire market. We have number one market share. We have a very experienced team. We have got over 6,200 stores, retail locations plus additional mortgage offices and I don't think anybody is better positioned to take advantage of business and we view it as a core business. We are growing this business. We want to continue to grow the business. We are not concerned about that. So we are going to have competition. We have non-bank competition in every one of our businesses.", "John, I don't know if you want to --", "John Stumpf", "Sure half of the U.S. population and half of the businesses in America reside within two miles one of our stores. Just think of that. And while people, a lot of times join us online, they pick the location, they pick the provider that they are familiar with or that's close by them because they still use the store even for the millennials who are very technologically advanced and savvy. So this is really a very important part of what we are doing.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Okay.", "John Stumpf", "So we don't know focus necessary just on share for share's sake. We focus on adding value and meeting the needs of our customers.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Great, just one last nitpicky question. If you look at the yield on the loan portfolio, commercial and commercial mortgage loans, just about $300 billion. It's a pretty sizable drops in the yield. Was that part of the restatement? Was that a PCI thing? Or was there something else going on there?", "Tim Sloan", "Those are mostly related to the decline in the PCI resolution.", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Got it, okay. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Moshe.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "John Stumpf", "Hi, Joe.", "Tim Sloan", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "I just wondered if perhaps you could give us any more clarity on the relative change in the mortgage related production expenses, quarter-to-quarter or sequentially, just based on the cutbacks you announced in the back half of last year?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, they were down. The way that I would think about it, Joe, is that we have been responding to the decline in the refinance activity and we started to do that in the summer and throughout the fall and through the winter. We think we are appropriately staffed right now to take advantage of the spring selling season. And so there will be a little bit of a reduction in terms of the base level of expense because of the changes or the decisions that we made in the first quarter in terms of the number of people, when you think about the second quarter. But we are hopeful, candidly, that the expenses rise in the mortgage business in the second quarter because that's going to be reflective of the fact that originations are up and there will be more incentive-based compensation.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. That makes sense. I guess beyond that, the other question would be just beyond mortgage. Do you see weather having any factor in your loan growth trends this quarter? And I guess, maybe another way of looking at is, how did the pipeline look at quarter-end relative to three months ago? Or how do you see loan growth progressing through the year?", "Tim Sloan", "Loan growth in general or in mortgage, Joe?", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "No, beyond mortgage, other categories.", "Tim Sloan", "The pipelines look good. I think we were really pleased. In the first quarter, $1 billion plus growth on a net basis and $7 billion in the first quarter, that's a really good first quarter, number one, just on an absolute number. The other thing that was exciting from our perspective is how broad-based it was. It wasn't just in any one specific business. It was in our commercial and wholesale businesses. It was in many of our consumer lending businesses and it was in the relationships we have in the wealth, brokerage and retirement business. So it was very broad-based. So we are optimistic about continued loan growth. I don't know what the number is going to be but none of our businesses are saying that they don't think they can grow loans for the rest of the year.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks for the update.", "Tim Sloan", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Please go ahead.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Good morning, John and Tim. Good morning. How are you guy doing?", "John Stumpf", "Good.", "Tim Sloan", "Good, Chris.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "First, Tim, good luck in your role and if Dave is listening, congratulations on his pending retirement. I am pretty jealous of that. Tim, I wanted to ask you a quick question, actually two quick questions. On the gross servicing, on the mortgage side, on page39 of the release. Before hedging and before any fair value adjustments, you had a pretty good increase, about a 15% increase in the gross servicing income from fourth quarter to first quarter. What would drive such a big increase despite the fact that the portfolio is roughly the same size? Does the lower expenses on foreclosures impact that gross servicing income?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, it\u2019s a fair point. When you look at that page, you see that our servicing fees were over $1 billion, which was terrific. Now you can look back and see that phenomena in the second quarter of last year too but it's primarily driven by the point you just made Chris and that is that the quality of the portfolios is better and that's a good thing but it's primarily a lack of late charges and special servicing fees and the like.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Okay and just an unrelated question. I am just kind of backing in on the reserve. You have been releasing about 10, well, I don't see releasing but the reserve ratio has been going down about 10 basis points plus or minus for the last couple of quarters per quarter. At that rate, if that were to continue, you would be at a reserve ratio to loans of 1.30%, 1.35% range by end of the year. Is that something that you are comfortable going to in an environment that we are in right now in terms of the regulatory environment?", "Tim Sloan", "Chris, candidly, I didn't appreciate the math that you just described that it's been about 10 basis points a quarter but it has been. It's been accidental more than anything. It's really a function of the underlying improvement in the portfolio. I think that that ratio will continue to improve. I don\u2019t know where, we don't know where it's going to land. It's going to be a function of the performance of the portfolio but it's definitely going to go down.", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Okay. Thank you.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous", "Good morning. I was wondering if I could ask about the Basel III capital and over the past couple of quarters, it's just grown faster than a simple model of earnings less dividend less buybacks and linking RWA growth with asset growth would imply. What's been the main drivers of that? And as we look forward, do you think the Basel III ratio continues to grow faster than that kind of simplistic view would imply? Or is it going to converge with the normal earnings growth rate?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, Brian, it\u2019s a good question. The whole topic is a little bit complicated, primarily because we have had a number of rule changes and rule interpretations by the entire industry, number one. If you recall in the third quarter, we did reduce our RWA and we called out some specific items in the third quarter to reduce our risk-weighted assets but I think the trend in terms of being different than just a basic math that you just described, it's more likely that it's going to closer to the basic math than you just described than not. Candidly it will continue to be a function of the underlying risk within the portfolio. That is the primary driver. If we can continue to improve credit quality, continue to improve market risk, continue to improve operational risk, those will be the big drivers because that's what the new methodology is based upon.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous", "I appreciate that and on the LCR, I know the rules aren't finalized, so all this is kind of prospective as opposed to anything you would be doing now but I guess in a very simplistic level, it seems to raise the value of retail deposits and lower the value of commercial deposits relative to each other just because the retail deposit runoff assumptions are so much lower. How big a deal is that? Is that something that just hit the margin, maybe it fits with the mix of commercial deposits or something or as currently written, is that a bigger deal that actually shifts the focus of industry deposit gathering?", "Tim Sloan", "I don't think it is going to fundamentally shift how we think about gathering deposits. And John, you may have a different view but I mean, anytime we can bring in and broaden a relationship with one of our retail or commercial customers, we want to do that. We want their deposits. What we don't like is our wholesale deposits in the more traditional defined sense or hot money, things like that. We are looking for long-term relationships but even in the most extreme interpretation of the new rules, we still want to grow our commercial deposits. And again that's because we have such a large deposit base. We are not overly concerned about the impact in terms of how it affects the LCR but we will know what the rules look like and the impact, I am sure, later this year.", "John Stumpf", "Brian, Tim is absolutely right. We just love deposits when they are part of a primary relationship and we like them. At times when some were asking us why you are growing deposits because you can't utilize them. And we said, it's good for long-term shareholder value. We have a fixed infrastructure and the more customers we can serve with that fixed infrastructure, magic happens. Not always every quarter and sure we are all looking for earning assets but I will take all the deposits we can get that are part of a primary relationship and we cross-sell off that and it's a major driver in customer loyalty. So it's a big emphasis here for us.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous", "Thank you for taking my questions.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "John Stumpf", "Hi Ken.", "Tim Sloan", "Hi Ken.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "I just wanted to follow-up on the deposit side question. So with you guys sounding pretty confident about the loan pipeline, we are also continuing to see a very strong amount of deposit growth from you guys as well as in the industry and I am just wondering, are there any undercurrents where you are at least starting to see customers use deposits to fund their businesses? Or do you think we are just into a new regime where it's all just about building the relationship and continuing to see deposits grow well as well as grow better. I guess the question is what's different, if anything, as far as how you are seeing loan pipelines grow versus deposit growth continuing?", "John Stumpf", "Let me take a shot at that. You are right. What you typically see, Ken, is when loan start to grow the customers tend to use their own cash first. So there is some of that going on but there's a lot of liquidity in the system. People are saving more. Americans save more now than they did in the last decade or two. And frankly, our the health of our retail delivery system, when I say the health, I mean the online and the stores and the ATMs and the mobile and phone, all of those working together as an omni-channel, is a very compelling value proposition for businesses and consumers and we are getting a disproportionate share. And we just love that.", "And I will also say this. Our deposit franchise is probably undervalued today given where absolute rates are and that will change over time. The other thing that's happened is we probably have a better set of competitors today than we have had. More rational competitors as in the past. So it's a combination of a lot of things and we are expecting to continue to see strong growth. When I look back at five years ago, when we merged with Wachovia, if you would exclude CDs, we had about $650 billion of deposits. Today if you exclude CDs, we are about at $1.50 trillion. We grew $400 billion dollars in five years.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Yes, great. My second question, just, IB was soft as it was for the industry on a quarter-to-quarter basis and some of that is seasonal but I just wanted to get your comments and your thoughts about market share opportunities and where you think the IB pipeline looks from here?", "Tim Sloan", "We continue to be optimistic about the growth in our investment banking business and the reason for that is that most of the business that we are doing in investment banking is with existing Wells Fargo customers who already have a relationship across the board. So because we haven't penetrated those customers as much as we would like, we still think that there is a lot of opportunity there. The market share is a result of focusing on customers and clients as opposed to trying to get to a specific market share number but you are right. We understand that that business can be a little bit volatile. We were down a bit this quarter. I am hopeful we will be up in the second quarter and the third quarter but as long as we focus on our clients and on the overall relationship, particularly those that are already, we have got a good chance to continue to grow the business.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay and then my last real quick one is just, you mentioned the discrete tax benefit in the first quarter. Can you just to clarify what your expectation is for the tax rate for the rest of the year?", "Tim Sloan", "Sure. The expectation is, it's likely the tax rate is going to go up. I would love to be able to tell you that we could have that kind of tax benefit every quarter but I sure wouldn't plan on it. I think it's more likely that the tax rate for the rest of the quarter, which obviously is going to be very dependent on how much money we earn and we are looking forward to growing revenues and growing income over time but I think it's more likely that that tax rate is going to be in the low 30s.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. Thanks. So kind of back to historical. Okay, got it. Thanks, guys.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "So, Tim, I am looking at this and thinking what are you leaving your successor, 17 quarters in a row of higher EPS and that's tough to continue. I know I have been asking this several quarters but if you take out I estimate $0.07 benefit due to the lower tax rate, that's a trend that's going to maybe be tough to continue. I don't what's your thought about that.", "Tim Sloan", "Well, Mike, I would love to take credit for 17 quarters of consecutive earnings growth but there's another 264,999 people around here that really get the credit for it. It's not about what we do every quarter. Obviously, we are very proud of not only the last 17 quarters but the last five years where we have grown our earnings on a compounded rate of 16%. So the trend has gone on for a long period of time but every quarter is a little bit different and the second quarter is going to have a different complexion than the first and the fourth and the third of last year but we continue to be optimistic, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Well, I would ask it a little bit differently. Revenues are down 3% year-over-year and it's good. Now expenses are down 4% and that's helped the efficiency improve from close to 59% down to 58% but that's still on the high end of your target of 55% to 59%. So did you guys not get as much in savings as you would have liked or is that a future opportunity?", "Tim Sloan", "We continue our goal of improving the efficiency of the company. We provided a range of 55% to 59% a couple of years ago and we haven't gotten to the 55% level. That's clearly a goal that we would like to achieve sometime. We think the improvement that we have made year-over-year and on a sequential quarter basis to get back to 57.9% has been very good. But I am hopeful that the primary reason that the dollar expenses could continue to grow in the company is because revenue is going to grow. That's a good thing and that's why we focus on efficiency. So there's still a lot of opportunity in terms of becoming more efficient at Wells Fargo. We are not done yet.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "On the expense side, can you just elaborate on a few of the key initiatives that might move that efficiency ratio to the lower end of the range?", "Tim Sloan", "Sure. There's not really any one key efficiency project, Mike. We are a large company. We have lots of different businesses and each business is focused on improving efficiency but for example, we are focused on the amount of space that we have. We have done a great job in terms of reducing the amount of square footage we have in the company but the fact of the matter is our people, our team members are working differently than they did 10 years ago and five years ago. They are spending more time with customers and less time in the office. So we have an opportunity to reduce occupancy cost and reduce our square footage over time. That would be an example.", "John Stumpf", "Mike, something else you could think about is that we still have a number of loss mitigation folks as we are still working with elevated foreclosure and those kinds of issues but on the other hand then we are investing more in operational risk and compliance and those sort of things. So you are right. We are at the higher-end of that range but on the other hand as you know that's a ratio. It's a numerator expenses divided by revenue and we have seen revenue because of interest rates on the margin revenues while we have been able to grow NII. The margin is not at an all-time high. So as that improves that will also give you some lift but whatever we do here we will be very careful about what we spend money on but never at the expense of the long-term but we are focused on it. That's a good point you bring up.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "That's why I brought up, revenues are down year-over-year and you are still at the high-end of the efficiency range but I guess we will hear more about that at the investor conference?", "John Stumpf", "Actually, that's actually a good thing. Think of revenues down and we actually improve the efficiency ratio but there is opportunity and yes, you are right, we will talk more about that.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "And then if you can just elaborate on the management changes, John. I guess you are gearing for the next generation. How much longer do you plan to stay around and who would be in the pool of potential successors?", "John Stumpf", "Well, I am glad you asked and I was going to give you that information. I am 60. I know you think I look a lot younger but I plan to stay here as the Board is okay with that and they want me through my 65th birthday and we have got great people here. We have a terrific team of leaders and you know some of them. I wish you could know more. For those of you who come to our investor conference next month you will get to meet more of them. Please come. That's one of the reasons we love to show you more of them. But this is a great team and I couldn't be more confident. In fact I think it's the best team in the industry. And one thing, even though, and Dave has been such a great leader, even with his leaving, the average tenure of my tenure is still around 28 years with this company.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, guys.", "Tim Sloan", "Hi, Matt.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "I am sorry if I missed it but did you provide the estimated leverage ratio under the new rules that came out last week or this week?", "Tim Sloan", "Matt, we didn't and we are still working through that calculation but just assume that at the parent company level, we are comfortably above 7%. So it's really not an issue for us.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay and that leads me to my next question. If we look at the three banks that are bigger than you, I think when you kind of put together all the new requirements out there for capital liquidity, it's a bit more onerous for them than it is for you. I am just wondering like are you actually seeing them pullback in certain areas that you now feel like you can compete in and has that changed since last year when we first got the current proposals for the SLR?", "Tim Sloan", "Matt, I wish that was the case. The business is very competitive across the board today. We expected that all of our competitors are going to adjust to whatever the new rules are. We have candidly been doing that since 2009 but it's a competitive market out there and hopefully for whatever reason, we can continue to grow.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then just lastly, a number of lumpy either revenue items or the tax gain, anything on the expense side besides a seasonal increase in cost that you would want to point out like litigation costs or anything else lumpy that we should be thinking about?", "Tim Sloan", "No. Not beyond the seasonal items in the first quarter but again I want to emphasize that you should expect some increases in other line items within expenses in the second quarter that I called out but nothing in the quarter that was lumpy from an expense standpoint other than the seasonal compensation related items.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, on that expense outlook, when you piece together the decline in some of the seasonal benefits and increases elsewhere, if we just kind of hold revenue flat quarter-to-quarter, do expenses stay flat or go up or down or what's the net of all those items?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, Matt, we will know for sure in about 90 days and I just don't know what the exact dollar expenses will be but one of the reasons why I called out some of the categories is reducing some of those categories are going to rise relative to their first quarter numbers. But again a lot of our expenses are driven off revenue. If revenues are higher in the second quarter and that's the reason that expenses are up, I think, we will all be very, very happy.", "John Stumpf", "Yes, I don't think any of us look to the future and say let's hold revenues flat. We think we are a growth company.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you, Matt.", "John Stumpf", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about the macro hedge on the mortgage side. The servicing profitability has actually tripled since last year, going from $300 million to about $900 million per quarter. That represents more than half of the mortgage banking income. So I just wanted to talk about and get your feelings on further improvements in that as we move forward and just have few precise questions about maybe some items that could help there as well.", "Tim Sloan", "Well, Marty, you are absolutely correct. Our servicing income is up significantly over the past few years or the past few quarters as you can see. The drivers are primarily the fact that the underlying quality of the portfolio continues to improve. So there is less adjustments that we need to take to the value for things like foreclosure cost to make any changes related to the consent order or servicing settlement and so on and so forth.", "In terms of the hedge, I wouldn't think about it as kind of a macro hedge. It's a very complicated set of hedging activities that we need to do. We have got a large group of people that does it. They are very experienced but as we have talked about in the past, we are not trying to make any sort of macro bets from an interest rate standpoint or in terms of a market standpoint.", "We are just trying to generate a predictable set of earnings from an underlying business that we like a lot. It was very beneficial when we went through the refinancing boom and we believe can continue to provide good earnings. You are absolutely correct that it's a larger portion of earnings than maybe the origination side but my guess is that's going to change from quarter-to-quarter depending upon origination volume.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "When I meant macro-hedge, I meant more originations versus servicing, not the hedging and the servicing portfolio.", "Tim Sloan", "Well, I am sorry. Yes, you are right. But again, I think sometimes folks think that somehow the servicing business is a natural hedge to origination volume and given what we have seen over the last year or so, given the size of the refinance opportunity, we can see that really wasn't the case.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "To some point but not completely?", "Tim Sloan", "Correct.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "When you look at the prepayment speeds, not really accelerating with refinance, not really coming off the floor, you still wrote down the MSRs about $400 million this quarter. I know rates came back in but really cash flow is what matter more than just a rate. So rates are proxy. But if don't get a significant increase in prepayment fees there really shouldn't be further write-downs in the portfolio at this point. So I was just curious what you thought or what was driving that write down this quarter?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, you are absolutely correct that rates are a driver. We have seen a lot of volatility in rates for certain but again rates are the primary driver, also just underlying prepayment fees that we are seeing for other reasons in terms of how quickly folks are selling their homes and moving elsewhere but our best guess is that we could continue to see some benefit from the servicing portfolio.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "And then lastly, the provision for unfunded commitments jumped up this quarter about $250 million. Is that something we should see at the same level? Or is that something you made a little adjustment on this quarter that might fall back as you move forward?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, it's a reflection of the fact that our loan commitments grew which is a good thing but also we just adjusted some of our estimates and I wouldn't anticipate that that would repeat itself on a quarterly basis.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "All right. Thanks.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "Good morning, guys. How are you?", "John Stumpf", "Hi Nancy.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "A question for you that, I think John McDonald asked the question about the release in loan loss reserves and I would sort of ask for an additional detail on that. How much of this release was enabled by the reserves you built after the Wachovia deal? In other words how much or how many of these reserves are related to better credit quality at Wachovia than you had anticipated?", "Tim Sloan", "You know what, I don't have the percentage off the top of my head, Nancy. I think what you saw is that we continued to build reserves throughout 2009 and I am trying to remember what quarter we stopped building reserves. I thought it was through most of 2009 but I would say it's a reflection of clearly improved credit quality in the underlying portfolio that we inherited from Wachovia as well as the Wells portfolio but I don't know what the percentage is just related to that because today it's really all mixed. We don't really think about it that way.", "John Stumpf", "But Nancy, you are right to this extent. The Wachovia portfolio turned out to be better than we had thought and if you just look at how much we have moved from, on the PCI side into the accretable from the non-accretable, and we especially did a lot better on the Pick-a-Pay. We just had a terrific team that attacked that early on but credit turned out, I think partly because of things that we did. It turned out to be quite a lot better.", "Tim Sloan", "But Nancy, again, just to reinforce John's last comment and I should have mentioned it, most of the improvement that we saw in the Wachovia portfolio, was really in what you see in PCI and the detail we provide there as opposed to in the loan loss reserve.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "Okay. Secondly, this is sort of a tangential credit quality question and has to do with Dave Hoyt's decision to retire. Number one, Tim, congratulations but with the admonition that timing is everything in life. Secondly, Dave Hoyt was the best in the industry at two things, number one, not answering a question. He was expert at that. But number two, just foreseeing credit quality trends way in advance and I have had the question from others and I am a little bit concerned that Dave is sort of looking out into the future here and seeing that commercial credit quality is about as good as it's going to get. Could you just comment on that?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, Nancy I worked for Dave for about 20 years and he absolutely was a terrific judge of credit quality. I think if Dave was on the phone, he would also say that there were hundreds if not thousands of people that there were behind him in wholesale banking that helped in that. So there's no question that Dave's retirement is something that we weren't looking forward to. But we have a great team here and I would not read into his retirement as him saying from here on in credit quality is going to significantly deteriorate at Wells Fargo.", "In fact, I think it's more likely that it's going to continue to improve. Now the likelihood in the commercial portfolio that we are going to continue to have quarters of recovery as opposed to loan losses, that's not going to happen forever. But the fact of the matter is that culture really matters and the culture that we have in the wholesale banking group in terms of making good credit decisions is going to continue on, because that's what Dave was very good at instilling in thousands of people within the wholesale banking group.", "John Stumpf", "And I can tell you my perspective and while I have not had that much time with Dave, I have only had 16 years with him. He is retiring. He has a fabulous family including grandchildren. He has a lot of other interests and he just felt it was right for him and while we are sad to see him go, we celebrate with him his next stage and as Tim mentioned, his legacy are the thousands of people that he has led that are in leadership roles right now that continue to propel this business forward.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "Well, please let him know that I am sure I am not the only analyst who is going to miss sparring with him. One other thing. On private equity, just the gains you had, you guys has long had an expertise in technology, private equity investments and is that still or is that sort of the primary source of a lot of the gains this quarter?", "Tim Sloan", "It was a source of some of the gains, Nancy, but it was really across the board. We had, as I mentioned, about the same resolutions, I would say about half were in technology-related, the other half weren't. And we are very pleased with the gains that we had this quarter but as you can appreciate that you can't count on those at the same level every quarter. I wish we could but this is a very buoyant time in the equity markets, both public and private, notwithstanding some of the market volatility over the last couple of days and we have got good management teams. As you said, we have been in the business for a long time. So we continue to be optimistic about the long-term success of those businesses but quarter-to-quarter, it's going to be what's it's going to be.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "All right. Thank you very much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Nancy.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Tim Sloan", "Hi Paul.", "Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets", "Hi. This is actually Jessica Ribner for Paul. How are you?", "John Stumpf", "Well, we have upgraded. How are you, Jessica?", "Tim Sloan", "Good.", "Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets", "You have upgraded. It's true. Then who is going to read the transcripts. You guys have actually shrunk your market share almost in half to about 16% over the last couple quarters or the last few quarters I should say but you are also talking about growing it. Where do you see that going?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, sure. It's a good question. Again if you step back and think about the time at which, in the cycle that our market share was so high, arguably two times, maybe a little bit less than that, it was because the primary source of mortgage origination volume depending upon the quarter could have been two-thirds of volume or three quarters of volume or even more in some quarters was refinance volume.", "So that's reflective of the fact that we are the largest servicer. We had the highest-quality servicing portfolio and generally those customers gave us the first call and we were able to meet their needs by refinancing that mortgage. We had indicated that we thought that as the refinancing volume declined and as the mix changed to more of a purchase money market, our market share would go down.", "So that was absolutely anticipated but we don't think of the business as a market share business. We think about it as how do we solve the needs of our customers. Do we have the right number of people in the right places? As John mentioned, we got the best distribution system in the market and so we are optimistic about being able to grow. Whether that means we will grow market share? I don't know but we are optimistic about growth in the business.", "John Stumpf", "Jessica, the other thing you should think about is that the 16% or whatever that number is 16% or 17%, part of it is in aggregation business where we do correspondent banking business and which we love that business but it's a lower margin business and part of it is a retail business where we actually originate the loan through one of our home mortgage consultants. Some of the correspondent business is going directly to Fannie and Freddie. So that business is actually changing a bit. So when you look even at the time when we had maybe double that share, you have to look at both sides of that and while I focus on all of it, it's also important to make that distinguishment.", "Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, well. Thank you. And then kind of a related question. You guys said earlier on the call that you added about $7.2 billion, it sounds like jumbo mortgages on the balance sheet. Is that correct?", "Tim Sloan", "No. Our loan growth was primarily, on a gross basis for the quarter was about $7 billion point-to-point. The growth in non-conforming mortgages on a gross basis, which would be the jumbo category, was about $5.8 billion.", "Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, and where do you see that trend going?", "Tim Sloan", "Hopefully it will continue to go up. I think that one of the areas that we indicated a couple of years ago at our Investor Day was a real effort on the part of our team in the wealth area as well as in our retail banking area to coordinate more on those opportunities and they have done just a terrific job. So we are hopeful with the improvement in the weather and the spring selling season that we will continue to see that grow over time.", "John Stumpf", "The one's we put on portfolio are very small part of the originations. It's less than 5% or so. So there's opportunity there.", "Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Well, thank you very much.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Stumpf", "Hi Keith.", "Keith Murray - Keith Murray", "It's actually Keith Murray for Keith Murray. So it\u2019s a bit of a downgrade for your guys. Sorry.", "John Stumpf", "We still think that\u2019s an upgrade.", "Keith Murray - Keith Murray", "Thank you very much. Just on all the new rules, you have got Basel III, you have got SLR, you have got LCR. When you think about loan pricing and pricing for commitments, has that all been factored in yet and are you still kind of working through the changes that will have to be made?", "Tim Sloan", "Really good question. I don't believe that the industry, set us aside for a minute, the industry has necessarily adjusted yet because their capital rules have just been finalized. The leverage rules, for example, are relatively new and we haven't seen the final liquidity rules. I am sure there will be some adjustments, just like there's been adjustments to all the other new rules and regulations that we have post-crisis. So I think it's more in the future than in the past.", "Keith Murray - Keith Murray", "Okay, and then are you seeing much impact from non-bank lenders out there? Every private equity firm, non-banks are seeing a lot of them try to do more loans to the middle market firms. So are you seeing much impact at all?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, there's no question that post-crisis, given a lot of the regulatory changes created opportunities for unregulated or differently regulated institutions and that's been the case for as long as I have been in the lending business and been with the bank. I think the important point to make is that generally though those firms frequently are very good are monoline firms and that is they have one product they can provide credit. How we differentiate ourselves is that we have relationships and that we can provide tens of products or more and broaden that relationship. So we don't find ourselves losing a lot of business to non-banks. I also think that generally the competitive environment is a little bit more rational than it would be today. But again, we have a real advantage when we compete against a monoline product provider versus our relationship-focused and cross-sell orientation.", "Keith Murray - Keith Murray", "Thanks, and then just finally, on fee based businesses that you have, if you look out for the rest of this year and through 2015, which of those businesses do you think has the most potential upside for revenue growth.", "John Stumpf", "We really all of our businesses. In fact, we think there's growth opportunity but a couple of them jump out wealth, brokerage, retirement. You saw that we are at 41% and I don't think we can do 41% every quarter or every year but that's a huge growth opportunity for us. The card business. We think we have got some exciting things happening there but that doesn't diminish anything else.", "We have opportunities with what we are doing international because we have more of our U.S. customers doing business there. We have opportunity in our capital markets businesses and even mortgage where you think where people would say, well, geez, you have the number one share. There is huge opportunity there. Half of our customers who call us at our bank who have a mortgage don't do it with us. So there is all kinds of opportunity here.", "Keith Murray - Keith Murray", "Okay. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.", "Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks very much. Hello. Just a couple of follow-up questions. One is, I know that your card fees declined by about the same amount as they did in the first quarter of last year but in terms of your actual charge volumes was there any decline that was more than what is typically seasonal in this first quarter?", "Tim Sloan", "No. Not at all.", "Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "No. So in other words, no disruption from weather or any other exogenous temporary employment or any other exogenous factor?", "Tim Sloan", "No. Not at all.", "Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay, and just turning to the gain on sale trend for a moment. I recognize that the changes weren't big but most of the proxies that we use suggested flat and so I am just wondering if there was anything in mix or otherwise that would have explained the decline?", "Tim Sloan", "No. There wasn't necessarily a big change in mix. That's one of the reasons why we have provided a range beginning in the third quarter of last year. I think there was a concern in the market that as volume went down that gain on sale margins would go down significantly. We think that the range that we have provided plus or minus 1.5% is a reasonable range to operate in but comparing any quarter, 5 to 10 to even 15 basis point level of volatility is not uncommon at all.", "Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "Great, and then lastly, just getting back to Brian's question about the accretion of Basel III capital versus the growth in earnings, recognizing that there should be convergence, it also seems that the quality of the portfolio that you have originated over the past few years has lower embedded risk. So wouldn't that suggest that as the risk component becomes an increasingly important determinant of your Tier 1 under the Basel III, wouldn't that suggest that Basel III capital continues to grow ahead of what the earnings math would otherwise suggest?", "Tim Sloan", "It could, but again, because it's a more complicated calculation right now because you have got the impact of market risk, you have got the impact of operational risk and candidly, the operational risk calculations for the regulators as well as the entire industry continues to be a work in progress and influx. I wouldn't want to jump to a conclusion that just underlying credit quality only would be the sole driver of improvement in RWA.", "Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "Great, and then just last one for me and I hate to come back to this topic because it's already been addressed many times, reserve releases. The nonperforming assets continue to come down but many of the forward-looking credit quality indicators are starting to flatten in terms of their sequential improvement. So all was equal and, of course, your portfolio of loans continues to grow, so all was equal, wouldn't that indicate that the pace of reserve release should start to decline also?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, it could and, to your point, that's what you have seen over the last three quarters. We went from a $900 million release in the third quarter to $600 million last quarter to $500 million this quarter. I don't know what the release is going to be in the second quarter. We do believe we are going to have a release but it's a fair point. I mean, this is not going to go on forever but the fact of the matter is the portfolio continues to improve.", "Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay, all right. Thanks very much.", "Tim Sloan.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS. Please go ahead.", "John Stumpf", "Derek?", "Operator", "Derek, your line maybe on mute. If you are on a speaker phone, please pick up your handset. And there is no response from that line.", "John Stumpf", "All right. Why don't we then conclude. Let me make a couple of comments. First of all, I would like to thank Tim Sloan for the great work he's done as our CFO. As you all know, he's going to take over the Wholesale Bank but Tim, thank you for the great leadership and the work you have done here. You have just been terrific.", "For those of you who don't know John Shrewsbury, many of you do, you will get to see him, if not before but you will surely see him when you come to our investor conference, remember that was May 20 in San Francisco. We look forward to seeing you. It's always an exciting time for us to talk about our business and share with you the enthusiasm and some of the great people that we have. So thank you very much for your interest in Wells Fargo and we will talk to you next quarter and the investor conference earlier than that.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Wells Fargo. We earned $5.7 billion in the quarter by our continued focused on creating long-term shareholder value to meeting our customers' financial needs including growing loans and deposits and deepening our relationships with our customers. ", "Let me highlight our growth during the second quarter compared with a year ago. We generated earnings of $5.7 billion, up 4% from a year ago and earnings per share up $1.01 per share, up 3% from a year ago. We had strong and broad based loan growth and our core loan portfolio is up $51.3 billion or 7%. Our credit performance continued to improve with total net charge-offs down $435 million or 38% from a year ago, and our net charge-off ratio was only 35 basis points annualized on average loans. Our outstanding deposit franchise continues to generate strong growth. With total deposit up $97 billion or 9%. We've grown deposits by an average of $265 million everyday over the past year. We deepened relationships across our company. Retail banking cross-sell was 6.17 products per household. Wholesale banking cross-sell was 7.2 products and wealth, brokerage and retirement cross-sell was 10.44 products. We reduced expenses from a year ago while we continue to invest in our businesses including strengthening our risk management infrastructure.", "We also follow through our commitment to maintain strong capital ratios while returning more capital to shareholders. In the second quarter we increased our common stock dividend by 17% and continued to reduce our share count. We returned our net $3.6 billion to shareholders in the second quarter, up significantly from $1.6 billion a year ago. I am also proud that during the second quarter Wells Fargo was ranked the most respected bank in the world and the 11th most respected company overall according to Barron's Magazine 2014 ranking of the world's most respected companies. This recognition is a result of our dedicated team members remaining focused on our consistent vision and their commitment to meeting our customers' financial needs. ", "While the economic recovery remains uneven, there are many indicators that economic growth is accelerating and we remain optimistic about the opportunities the recovery provide to Wells Fargo and for our customers. The strong improvement employment in June demonstrated the strength in a labor market with unemployment at lowest level since September 2008. The housing market rebound remained on-track with home prices up 8% from a year ago and up 25% from the low in June 2011. Despite these increases home affordability continued to remain attractive due to historically low mortgage rates and rising household incomes. In June, the conference board's measure of consumer confidence reached a six year high and vehicle sales reached an eight year high. The economy is also benefiting from strong energy production with domestic crude oil production running at the highest level in 26 years and our reliance on foreign energy sources has been falling for nearly a decade. ", "I am confident that the economic recovery and our diversified business model will continue to provide opportunities for future growth as we remain focused on helping our customers meet their financial needs. ", "Now John Shrewsberry, our CFO will provide more details on our second quarter results. John? ", "John Shrewsberry ", "Thanks, John. And good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions. Wells Fargo had a very strong quarter as demonstrated by fundamental drivers of long-term growth. We earned $5.7 billion in the second quarter; down a $167 million from the first quarter but keep in mind our results last quarter included a $423 million discrete tax benefit and $0.08 per share impact. Our pre-tax income grew $303 million from the first quarter. Revenue grew from first quarter including both net interest income and noninterest income. Core loans grew 8% annualized and average deposits grew 9% annualized. We grew pre-tax, pre-provision profit for the third consecutive quarter and credit quality continued to improve. Capital remains strong and we returned more capital to shareholders. I will highlight the drivers of this growth throughout the call today.", "As John highlighted and as you can see on Page 3, we had strong year-over-year growth in loans and deposits. Our growth in EPS and net income reflected this benefit along with the reduction in expenses and an improvement in credit quality. Our results were driven by momentum across many of our businesses. One way to demonstrate this business momentum is through noninterest income growth. Mortgage fees while up from first quarter were down $1.1 billion from a year ago due to lower refinancing volume. Excluding mortgage fees, fee income was up 9% from a year ago reflecting broad based growth in retail brokerage, deposit service charges, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage commissions, trust and investment management, merchant processing and market sensitive revenue. That's the benefit of our diversification. We have over 90 businesses focused on meeting our customers' financial needs. We also grew net interest income from a year ago. And as you know growing net interest income measured in dollars has been our focus as deposits and other sources of liquidity have growth more rapidly than loan demand or other attractive investment opportunities.", "Page 4 highlights our revenue diversification. While our balance between net interest income and noninterest income has been consistent, the drivers of noninterest income can vary each quarter. For example, equity investments were 9% of our fee income in the first quarter but declined to 4% in the second quarter. Other businesses such as deposits, investment banking and mortgage contributed more to fee income this quarter resulting in overall fee income growth demonstrating the benefit of diversified business model.", "Let me highlight some of the key drivers of our second quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective starting on Page 5. Our balance sheet is never been stronger, capital liquidity, asset quality, funding mix are all exceedingly strong. We increased average earnings assets by 3% from the first quarter by growing loans, increasing short-term investment in trading assets and purchasing securities. In addition, our credit quality continues to improve. Investment securities increased $8.7 billion from first quarter reflecting $17 billion of purchases primarily U.S. Treasuries and federal agency debt partially offset by run off. We also improved our liquidity position in response to continued heightened regulatory expectations. We issued $7.8 billion of liquidity related long-term debt and increased liquidity related short-term funding by $5.9 billion. Total short-term investments grew to $238.7 billion which helps us meet our regulatory obligations and provides dry powder to grow loan and invest in securities.", "Turning to the income statement on Page 6, revenue grew $441 million with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. The $246 million growth in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher revenue based incentive compensation and deferred compensation expense and an increase in operating losses primarily from litigation accruals related to various legal matters. I'll explain the drivers of our expenses in more detail later on the call. ", "Income tax expense increased from the first quarter which included $423 million discrete tax benefit. As shown on Page 7, we continue to have strong, broad based loan growth in the second quarter. Our 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth even with the continued reduction in our liquidating portfolio of $56.5 billion over the same time period. Our core portfolio which excludes our liquidating portfolio grew by $51.3 billion or 7% from a year ago and was up $15.2 billion or 8% annualized from the first quarter. Period end loans were up $29 billion or 4% from a year ago and up $2.5 billion from the first quarter. This growth was impacted by the transfer of $9.7 billion of government guaranteed student loans to held for sale which removes them from total loans. These student loans have been included within our liquidating portfolio since we stopped originating them in 2010. We transferred this portfolio to held for sale at the end of the second quarter reflecting our intent to sell our entire government guaranteed portfolio. However, we remained committed to the private student lending business. Excluding this transfer, total loans would have increased to $12.2 billion or 6% annualized linked quarter.", "On Page 8 we highlight how broad -based our loan growth continues to be at Wells Fargo. C&I loans were up $19.4 billion or 10% from a year ago as we successfully grew loans across our commercial businesses including asset backed, corporate, government, commercial and asset based. Real-estate 1 to 4 family first mortgage loans grew $7.3 billion or 3% with growth in high quality nonconforming mortgage primarily jumbo loans. Foreign loans grew $6.2 billion or 15% from a year ago reflecting growth in trade finance and the U.K. Commercial Real Estate acquisition we completed in the third quarter of last year. Auto loans were $5.5 billion or 11% reflecting strong origination as we remained the number one auto lender in the country while maintaining our focus on pricing for risk. Commercial real estate loans were $4.4 billion or 4% reflecting new origination and an acquisition in the third quarter of last year. Credit card balances were $2.4 billion or 10% with new accounts up 4%. Our growth rate has been above the industry average reflecting new account growth, product enhancement and increased usage among our existing customers. Deposit growth also remained strong in the second quarter with average deposits growing $91.7 billion or 9% from a year ago and up $24.2 billion from the first quarter, up 9% annualized. Average deposits totaled $1.1 Trillion and we benefited from strong growth in both commercial and consumer balances. Our average deposit cost declined to 10 basis points in the second quarter, down 1 basis point from the first quarter and down 4 basis points from a year ago. Our ability to generate strong deposit growth while reducing deposit cost demonstrated the fundamental strength of our outstanding deposit franchise. We have been able to grow deposits by offering best in class products and excellent customer experience and robust multi channel option. Our primary consumer checking customers were up 4.6% from a year ago. Our ability to grow primary customers is important to our results because these customers have more interaction with us, have higher cross-sell and are more than twice as profitable as non primary customers. ", "As shown on Page 10, tax equivalent net interest income increased $184 million from first quarter benefiting from an additional day in the quarter organic loan growth in higher mortgages held for sale in trading assets. Our NIM declined from the first quarter to 3.15% driven by customer deposit growth which essentially neutral to net interest income but reduced the margin by approximately five basis points. Liquidity related actions we took in the second quarter to meet increase regulatory liquidity expectations reduced the margin by one basis point however higher income from variable sources including higher PCI resolutions and periodic dividends offset this decline. Balance sheet repricing in growth once again did not impact the NIM this quarter as the majority of the repricing from the higher rate environment to the current rate environment is behind us. ", "Noninterest income increased $265 million from the first quarter with growth across our diversified businesses including mortgage banking, investment banking, deposit service charges, card fees, retail brokerage, commercial real estate brokerage and insurance, offsetting a $460 million decline in market sensitive revenue. Market sensitive revenue declined 34% from first quarter while all other noninterest income grew 8%. Trust and investment fees increased $197 million or 6% from first quarter on higher investment banking and retail brokerage asset based fees. Mortgage banking grew $213 million from first quarter, up 14% with growth in both originations and servicing. The second quarter benefited from a seasonally stronger purchase market with 74% of our originations coming from home purchases, up from 66% last quarter. Total originations increased to $47 billion, up 31% are unclosed pipeline increased to $30 billion at the end of the quarter, up 11%. We also continue to see improvement in our net servicing results for servicing revenue up $97 million from the first quarter reflecting higher MSR hedge performance and an increase in net servicing fees reflecting the benefit of lower servicing and foreclosure costs. ", "As shown on Page 12, expenses were up $246 million from the first quarter while our efficiency ratio remained at 57.9% reflecting our revenue growth. The key drivers of our expenses included personnel expenses declined $106 million from the first quarter which included seasonally elevated incentive compensation and benefit cost, salary increased as expected due to annual merit increases and one extra day in the quarter. Personnel expense included $130 million of higher revenue based incentive compensation in the second quarter which is a type of expense increase we like to see because we are growing the top line. Additionally, personnel expenses were impacted by $84 million in higher deferred compensation expense which offset in trading revenue. Outside professional services and advertising expense increased from the first quarter levels which tend to be seasonally lower. And operating losses increased $205 million from the first quarter largely due to litigation accruals for various legal matters. We remained focused on managing expenses and we expect our efficiency ratio will remain within our target range of 55% to 59% for the third quarter. ", "Turning to our business segment starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.4 billion in the second quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 11% from first quarter primarily from higher taxes. Retail banking cross-sell was 6.17 products per household, up from 6.14 a year ago. Our debit and credit card businesses continued to grow benefiting from account growth and higher usage. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago driven primarily -- driven by primarily checking customer growth. Credit card purchase volume was 16% from a year ago with new account growth and more active accounts. Active accounts were up 14% as the Wells Fargo credit card is becoming more top- of-wallet for our customers. Credit card household penetration increased to 39%, up from 35% a year ago. We remained committed to serving our small business customers at an increased primary business checking account customers 5.2% from a year ago. During the second quarter, we launched Wells Fargo Works for Small Business, an initiative that provides guidance and services to small business owners. This new initiative is resulted in strong engagement with small businesses across the country including millions of views of our online video series and increased traffic to wellsfargoworks.com. ", "Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter down 3% from a year ago and up 12% from the first quarter. Loan growth remained strong and broad based across businesses, up 8% from a year ago and up 2% from first quarter. Capital finance increased $2 billion from first quarter driven by higher utilization rates, new customer growth and growth in factoring assets. Commercial banking grew $1.8 billion from the first quarter with widespread growth across geographies and industries. Commercial real estate grew $1.4 billion driven by new loan originations including customer M&A activity. In addition, corporate banking, government and institutional banking, asset backed financed and equipment financed portfolios all grew from the first quarter. Revenue increased 7% from the first quarter reflecting diversified growth across a number of wholesale banking businesses. Investment banking revenue growth was broad based across product categories. Eastdil Secured, our commercial real estate brokerage business increased revenue, strong performance in public and private markets. Asset management fees grew -- from increased market valuation and in flows. Total assets under management increased $35 billion from a year ago. Long-term assets including equity and fixed income strategies were up 12% while money market funds have declined by 4% from a year ago. The shift out of money market funds moderating growth in total asset under management but revenue benefited from the shift to higher fee generating long-term assets. Wholesale banking revenue also benefited from the sale of 40 insurance offices in the quarter. ", "Wealth brokerage and retirement earned $544 million in the second quarter, up 25% from a year ago and up 15% from the first quarter. The strong year-over-year results reflected 9% revenue growth driven by recurring revenue. Net interest income was 11% from a year ago and asset based fees were up 14% benefiting from market performance and continued client demand for plan based advisory solutions. Our brokerage advisory assets have grown to $409 billion, up $78 billion or 24% from a year ago. Loan growth remained strong with average loans of 12% from a year ago driven by growth in high quality nonconforming mortgages in security based lending. We also benefited from the partnership involving WBR and community banking to better meet our customers' saving retirement planning and investment needs and we increased the number of private bankers in our banking stores by 22% from a year ago. ", "Turning to Page 16, credit quality continue to improve with second quarter credit losses down $108 million from first quarter and the net charge-off ratio decline into 35 basis points of average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only 3 basis points of average loans and consumer losses continue to decline to 62 basis points. Nonperforming assets have declined for seven consecutive quarters and were down $686 million from first quarter although the pace of improvement is slowed. We had a $500 million reserve release is same as in first quarter. We continue to expect future reserve releases, absent a significant deterioration in the economy but expect a lower level of future releases as the rate of credit improvement slows and the loan portfolio continues to grow. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach fully phased-in increased to 10.09% in the second quarter. Our share count declined in the quarter reflecting the repurchase of 39.4 million common shares and we executed a $1 billion forward repurchase contract which expected to settle in the third quarter for approximately 19.4 million shares. We expect our share count to continue to decline throughout 2014 as a result of anticipated net share repurchases. We also increased our dividend to $0.35 per share in the second quarter a 17% increase. Our net payout ratio in the second quarter was 66% in line with our recent guidance of 55% to 75%. ", "In summary, our results in the second quarter demonstrated the momentum across our fundamental business drivers including growing loans and deposits, increasing both net interest income and noninterest income while credit improved and capital remained strong. While we've demonstrated our ability to grow during the variety of economic and interest rate environments, we are well positioned to benefit from an improving economy and higher rates. Our diversified business model provides us with many opportunities to better meet our customers' financial needs as economic growth become robust. Our strong balance sheet with our large balance of short-term investments primarily driven by our strong deposit growth provides us the ability to further grow loans and invest in securities. We are optimistic that our outstanding franchise and our focus on serving the real economy will continue to produce strong results. ", "We will now open up the call for questions. Jim?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, good morning. John, was wondering on the legal side of things. Can you give us a sense of what type of legal issues you are building reserves for? And also can you comment whether you are having discussion with the DOJ and mortgage task force, made up of state AGs that other banks are having discussion with?", "John Shrewsberry ", "The best disclosure for our legal activity is found in our Q and K where there is great detail on item that are probable and estimable and frankly even more matters, we can't comment on anything specifically. The items that I referred in the expense section or variety of matters that essentially added up to the number that you saw. ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "On the loan growth, can you comment what you are seeing in terms of utilization of lines by customers, is that getting better and what's driving what appears to be slight kind of acceleration in the loan growth you saw this quarter. ", "John Shrewsberry ", "", "Well, we called out one area where there has been an increase in utilization in the comments that was in capital finance but overall in wholesale banking utilization is relatively flat, it's ticked up just a little bit. So this is -- this loan growth isn't just driven by that. ", "John Stumpf ", "John, the nice thing about the loan growth is broad based. If you look at it's consumer, it's private banking area, commercial and cross so it's really broad based, it is one of the -- I think the strengths in what we have been doing the last number of quarters especially this quarter. ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And then last thing for me John on the net interest income side of things. Do you know at this point is the liquidity building you have been doing, is that done or you are not sure yet on that front? ", "John Shrewsberry ", "We think that where we stand today is probably about where you need to be and if the final rule making around LCR comes in a little bit differently then the actions that we have to take shouldn't materially change things so we are about where you need to be.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And seems that the churn has stopped with your reinvestment rates kind of looking like they match your roll-off rates. So I guess from -- with that perspective in mind, are you looking to grow an interest income dollar kind of in line with loan growth from here or there are other factors we should think about? ", "John Shrewsberry ", "Well, you should be -- should look at the balance sheet at every period and assess what types of inflows we have of additional liquidity and what we have done with it. Some of will be loan growth, there will be more security growth; there will be some that sits in cash while we wait to make decision about securities investments. So the facts and circumstances will lead it on that path but back to your question about roll-off and roll-on, it appears that the NIM hasn't been diminished by a change in pricing scheme with respect to loans or securities for that better because of what you described. ", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", " ", "Okay. And you are still looking to grow net interest income from the current levels? Do you still think you can do that? ", "John Stumpf ", "Absolutely", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks, good morning, everyone. Hi, there. I guess first was just on-- upon -- question on the loan growth. I guess specifically in C&I end of period loan were up little over $9 billion or almost 5% sequentially, the strongest increase to the past year. I was just curious little bit more what's driving that? Are you are seeing signs of increase confidence among borrowers and may be more of a willingness to make investment? ", "John Stumpf ", "Joe, this is John Stumpf. We are seeing that. As I am always talking with customers and our talking with our team, there is as I mentioned in my opening comments, there is more optimism. I think consumer confidence is at six year high. It is not breakout but it's -- we are having more discussion with more customers about buying homes, buying autos, investing in infrastructure if you are a business, buying something so we are real economy company. We are in the real economy and there are certain sectors of economy that are doing very well. We are big energy lender both on renewal side and the hydrocarbon side, plus the real estate has been very good for us, little market such it's very broad based.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that's great, thanks. I guess the other question was just if you could talk a little bit more about what's your experience has been in mortgage with the spring selling season. And how do you feel about both volumes and staffing levels for the rest of the year there?", "John Shrewsberry ", "Sure. Well, we've been pretty clear on the record that we found the spring selling season to be little less than we have originally imagined, although it is nice growth from the first quarter just based on the time of year. And our view on the whole year in terms of mortgage origination is not inconsistent with the MBA and other published metrics. So you can see our pipeline going into the third quarter higher than it was going into the second. So that's probably means good things for the third quarter relative to the second quarter. The margins are holding in there. But we are not seeing -- we are not seeing a breakout returns to pre crisis levels of the enthusiasm around home ownership and so the purchase market is softer than we thought that it would be. ", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "And is that like to drive any other right sizing on the staffing side or do you feel pretty good about where you stand there? ", "John Shrewsberry ", "I think -- we have been very good at being flexible about that work force. And adding as we needed to as production volumes increased and then making changes as production volume decrease. So I think we are keeping that in sync with the production opportunity.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Hey, my first question is a follow up to John's line of questioning. The first is you feel like you in are where you need to be in terms of liquidity. And the majority of the repricing from the high interest environment as you said John to the current interest rate environment is behind you. Can we assume that Wells Fargo's net interest margin is close to the bottom with the wild card being deposit growth being stronger continuing to be stronger? ", "John Stumpf ", "I would say this way Erika. Again, we don't manage to the margin; deposit growth has an impact on the margin. What we say -- what we are saying is we are focused on growing net interest income and we believe we can do that. And loan demands been good and that is good for growing net interest income. Secondly, we have millions of dollars available in that cash flow if you will, to make investments at the right time so we are optimistic about growing net interest income over the long term. The margin will be impacted by -- cost growth has a big influence on that. And again most at neutral to income if not neutral to the margin.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "And the second follow up question just as we think about the next quarter's earnings power, I know that it is in the appendix that you did reclassify about $2 billion from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield and you are expecting the yield on the Pick-a-Pay portfolio or the accretable percentage to be 6.15% from 4.98% this quarter, is that going to have a positive impact on net interest margin as sequential basis as we take into account all the different components of the core balance sheet that we talked about so far in this call.", "John Shrewsberry ", "You should think about that as worth about $65 million per quarter in terms of incremental accreted interest income. It's related to the $1.9 billion re-class from nonaccretable yield to accretable yield and over the life that it will accrete under and based on the balance it's related to. Helpful? ", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", " ", "Got it. And just -- yes, and the third follow up question is another follow up to John's. I know you are not going to answer any questions about litigation in depth but I guess as we think about further accruals in your litigation reserve, can we expect as we think about the next few quarters Wells Fargo continuing to maintain at 55% to 59% efficiency ratio despite potential higher operating losses from legal accrual? ", "John Shrewsberry", "I would say that given everything that we know we anticipate operating between 55% and 59%. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Thanks, good morning. First question just on the mortgage business. I am just wondering John, two things. First of all, just your general sense of the gain on sale environment, obviously it is continue to reset lower but do you think we've gone to more stable kind of base here?", "John Stumpf ", "Yes, I do. I think the margins have been running in that 140 to 160 range and from what we see there is rationality in pricing. And those margins are look reasonable to us. We have no reason to believe it will be markedly different from that in the near future. ", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "And my second mortgage question and the servicing fees line, it had a nice expansion but with the book not growing and rates back down, so I am wondering can you give us some context of what the growth driver has been underneath that servicing fees line? ", "John Shrewsberry ", "Well, so it's -- it has a lot to do with servicing expenses. So fewer on reimburse expenses coming through, fewer foreclosure and default expenses so it is more efficient servicing operation and more of the net fees flowing to the bottom line. ", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. So we will see that all in the Q?", "John Shrewsberry ", "Yes. ", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. Then my third question is just on capital and capital return. Clearly $0.35 dividend, you earned $1.01; so above the 30% threshold that we've known to be the benchmark. So given that we are now past this year's stress test, can you just give us your thoughts around flexibility around and above that 30%? And kind of your post-game on how you have looked at this year's stress test process in that regard.", "John Shrewsberry ", "We think 66% payout ratio comes with the combination of repurchase and dividend is an excellent spot to be in. It is between the goal post that we set up 55% to 75%. Can't be much more precise than that but we hear our shareholders loud and clear that they want more return of capital. We are committed to executing on that so that's about all the rest to say. And we look forward CCAR process. ", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Okay. Then my last tiny one related to that is just -- the buyback was bigger, the share count just dripped lower. How close are we to finally getting that average diluted share count really starting to move downward?", "John Shrewsberry ", "That's a good question. You can see the point-to-point numbers that have changed. The average is what it is just because of the timing in the quarter between when we issued shares to our benefit plans and when shares were repurchased with repurchase was little bit more even throughout that -- throughout the quarter and the issuance was a little bit more front end loaded. So the average didn't change as much as the point-to-point but it will be probably be like that during quarter where there is slightly heavier issuance but yet we expect the net number to trend down the way we've described it. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Hi, what was the amount of gain on the sale of the 40 insurance branches? ", "John Shrewsberry ", "About a $100 million ", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Okay. And conceptually was there anything that offset that? I guess you had the increase in litigation accruals of $200 million. Anything else that would be kind of nonpermanent?", "John Shrewsberry ", "It's tough to describe expenses as permanent and non-permanent. I know you are looking for an offset for that non recurring revenue but the expense story is the efficiency ratio story, if we've got for example this quarter higher incentive compensation related to revenue growth that's going to move things around. We've got our deferred comp hedging that moves things around. So it is hard to give you a neat offset to that.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "How about the run rate in minority expense? There was a decline and that helped a little bit. Is that permanent? ", "John Shrewsberry", "It's hard to say whether that's permanent or not. We will work with Jim Rowe and get you something specific. So we can responsive to that", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", " ", "Okay. And then the increase in investment banking linked quarter was up a lot. Can you give any context to that? ", "John Shrewsberry ", "It's broad based so there is some equity capital market, debt capital markets, loans indication, M&A activity, it was just a busier quarter, I think that our investment banking share might have picked up a little bit but the whole market was busier in the second quarter than it was in first quarter. ", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", " ", "And mortgage originations, as you mentioned they were up linked quarter. And it seemed a little bit better than what you were saying at the Investor Day. So were things a little bit better? And if so, why? I know it's not as much as you originally thought for the spring selling season. But that's a little bit of a bump and I guess you expect a little more of a bump in the third quarter.", "John Shrewsberry ", "Well, the gain was at the low end of the range which is how we thought about and described in Investor Day. In terms of volumes they were -- I think we feel about the same as we did six weeks ago which it is was less than we had originally anticipated. So we feel about the same. We are glad the results are good. They are certainly up seasonally quarter-over-quarter. But we might have imagined a little bit more going in to year.", "John Stumpf ", "Mike, about 74% of our originations are production this quarter was purchase money and that really plays into our hand. We have long-term relationships with realtors and builders. We have a wonderful crew of people who are our team members are out calling so we should expect to do better vis-\u00e0-vis because others who don't have a sales force on the ground. ", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Okay. And then last question. I guess what -- I'd ask two sides of the same question. Are you taking too much risk in an area such as auto lending, where the loans are up 10% year-over-year? You have had some cautionary language from regulators, and it seems like every bank is expanding in auto lending. So are you concerned about that? On the other hand are you taking enough risk? Because based on our models which go back a couple decades, it looks like your net charge-off ratio for the firm is the lowest ever in modern history. So that would say take more risk. So where do you come out on that decision?", "John Stumpf ", "Well, Mike, you hit both side right. I mean it is I think 35 bases -- it is loss - I remember in my 37 years with the company and in the auto area specifically we looked carefully at what's going on with FICO scores and we look at delinquencies and a whole bunch of things there. So no I don't think we are taking inappropriate risks. Is that going for taking the right risks and we are finding the right place? And after all this is a business that we have been in long time and we don't come and show up and leave and secondly it is a short -dated asked that we know a lot about -- ", "John Shrewsberry ", "And you probably recall at Investor Day we had a specific slide on disclosure on the growth in the auto portfolio in particular that showed among other things over a long period of time what's been going on in our portfolio with FICO scores, average loan to value and payment to income ratio of our auto customers. And each of those has improved, not only over the last five years but improved meaningfully from pre crisis levels. So the portfolio actually looks really good. Our relationship with -- and autos and our business proposition there is that we own the relationship with dealers. We banked the dealers directly, we provide them with floor plan financing, and we provide them with real estate financing. We bank them personally and we are a very reliable takeout for indirect auto paper and we get more than our fair share as a result of the paper we want and the portfolio composition reflects that. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, thanks much. A couple questions. One is on the mortgage origination side. And I think you were doing some rollouts on July 1. Just wanted to see how those executed, and now that that's behind you, are there any opportunities to make that side of the business more efficient.", "John Shrewsberry ", "When you say rollout, do you mean changes in headcount? ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Well, there were some technology changes and some systems-related changes, process-related changes that you did effective July 1.", "John Stumpf ", "Well, Betsy, we have been doing a number of those over a period of time, be more efficient and to give our sales force more information upon sale but that's not a big issue. I mean those things happen, that haven't any impact on the business. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just looking forward a little bit less positive on the outlook for volumes for the full year. Is there any opportunity to peel back some of the investment in the production side of the business? Or are you sticking with your current plan at this stage?", "John Shrewsberry ", "We are very flexible about that. And constantly reading what we think we need in terms of capacity. As you know, the work force in that line of business has become flexible work force just because of the ebbs and flows of origination patterns as a refinancing opportunity comes into the money and then goes away. So I think we are very real time in responding and what we think we need. And if we think that we need more because the third quarter opportunity seems bigger then we will staff it up and if we think that we need less then we will dial it back.", " ", "John Stumpf ", "Betsy, you are on important point and I think it has been asked couple of times this morning. In the mortgage's business besides having to be good underwriter, good servicers, and all those things, good at flexibility, wrapping up and wrapping down is a core competency here. And if you are in this business and you have to be good at that. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. One other thing -- ", "John Stumpf ", "No. You never know what the volumes are going to be. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Sure; no. Then one of the things you did mention at Investor Day is that Mel Watt obviously had some suggestions for underwriting and potentially changing some of the elements of the grid and I know that you had indicated that there were several meetings that you were going to be taking -- that were taking place with you and others in DC around those suggestions. Can you give us any sense as to how those dialogues have been going? Any update on how you're thinking about underwriting in the credit box?", "John Stumpf ", "Well, those meetings with our mortgage company continue with Mel Watt and his team and others. I think the goals here is to get more credit corporately to borrowers who want to own homes and who can afford homes. And that's in the interest of borrowers; it is in interest of lenders like us, and interest in investors and the country. So we are trying to harmonize that. Some things in the past created less harmony. You low rates at one side encouraging borrowing and you have put backs from the GSEs on the other side that make lenders less willing to lend money. So we are trying to get everybody on the same page. I think he has been helpful in that and obviously we are participating in that. So and as we get more clarity there we can make loans, confirming loans that serve more customers. That's the goal there. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. As I know you'd spent a lot of time with the FHA, and that at the margin helped open the credit box in certain parts. I mean do you feel like you're at the stage where we're likely to see any changes come this year? Or it's really more of a next-year event with the GSEs?", "John Stumpf ", "Well, I'll tell you predicting what happen in Washington on legislation is -- that's way above my pay scale so but the important point is here is that there are some incremental changes happening and that's helping open the credit box a bit and corporately so we are still doing full underwriting and those sort of things. But I hate to venture a guess on when GSE reform will become law. ", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Right. No, I was asking really more about when your credit box on GSEs would loosen up potentially versus what had happened at the FHA where you have already loosened up a little bit there so -- ", "John Stumpf ", "I understand, okay. Well, we are just -- we're keep working on that and I think there is lot of emphasis on may be sure again corporate customers get loans that they can repay. ", "John Shrewsberry ", "And capturing that first time buyer that lower credit quality customer may be very -- will be very important to that customer when credit becomes available but not likely to change the overarching view of what the size of the mortgage market is in 2014 or 2015. And it is not likely to have a big impact on earnings of mortgage originators. There is not that much going on there. It is very important to them but there aren't enough for those loans at 140 basis points to make a giant different. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "", "Good morning. It seems like from here the efficiency ratio will be increasingly important, just given how low the credit costs are at these levels and you talked about maybe some less reserve release going forward. So just as we think about that efficiency ratio and being closer to the higher end, is there opportunity to migrate down in this environment? And if so, how do we think about the expense opportunity versus growing revenues?", "John Shrewsberry ", "Sure. Well, we are -- I will stand out by saying we are sticking with our 55% to 59% because that's where we think we will be through the cycle. We constantly focus on our efficiency, we spend a lot of time in that many programs designed to root out and to get the bottom of the most efficient use in resources that we can have. And that's important because there are areas where we continue to spend and invest money to have the right people facing customers and investing the right product for customers. And there are also areas like risk management, compliance, technology etcetera where we are making increasing investment to build the better company for the future. So all that's going on at the same time. And it would arrive that this 55% to 59%. You can rest assure that we are doing what we can to keep expense as efficient but I wouldn't count on a big lever there moving down closer to 55% all other things being equal to drive near-term performance.", "John Stumpf ", "So couple examples of things that we are doing. As you know about since the merger five years ago we've reduced the number of square feet that we used to house our people and through our stores and so forth from 100 let say 15 or 17 million square feet to 94-95 million square feet. We are testing and successfully so a new urban store if you will, neighborhood store, we have now three of those in the Washington area, have a very different expense component but still just as productive. So there is a lots of things we are working on. So we can use those dollars and savings to invest in other areas of business that John mentioned. Expense -- there is lot of focus on that here but not -- again I have said in the past we are not slavish to it. If our expenses grow because revenues growing up, that's a good thing. And we will make the investment that we believe will make-- need to make for the long-term success of the company. ", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So if I am hearing you correctly, as we think about the efficiency ratio going forward, there may be some opportunities for it to tick down a little bit, more dependent on revenue.", "John Stumpf ", "I would say yes surely, it is a ratio. So no matter it is denominator, we are working both side of it. ", "John Shrewsberry ", "", "And as we've said publicly in the past to the extent that we had revenue increases as a result of rates moving up. We probably migrate to the lower end of efficiency ratio because those dollars of revenue don't have expense attached to them. ", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", " ", "Okay. Yes, I'm harping on it because the efficiency ratio hasn't really moved the last several quarters. As we start thinking about the back half of the year and going forward the mortgage revenue comps get a lot easier and it feels like we could start seeing some improvement there so --", "John Shrewsberry ", "Have you noticed that were best in class at the ratio where we currently operate? ", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Understood. Fair point. Just separately on the tax rate, last quarter came in low; you called out that gain both at the time and then again today. But today's or the second-quarter tax rate seems a little bit higher than at least what we were looking for. What is the outlook? Should we pencil in the 32% going forward or --? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. You said pencil today's effective rate going forward. ", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. and then just lastly, I had a follow-up on an earlier question. The mortgage servicing revenue that is coming from the MSR gains, that is writing up the MSR because the expenses to service the loans are coming down?", "John Shrewsberry ", "That's right. The future cash flows are higher as a result of future expenses coming down, current and future expenses coming down. ", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And is there still I feels like there is still opportunity to reduce the cost of servicing going forward, which therefore would increase the value of the MSR. It feels like there is still more of that opportunity there.", "John Shrewsberry ", "There maybe. We are probably in that middle innings of perfecting servicing over time. There are still -- and more of elevated level of troubled loans out there compared to what we hope to steady status years from now. And when that happens it will be in the future and the benefit of will be the discounted than future benefit of it but you are right, it is probably opportunities at some point in future. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Please go ahead with your question.", "Keith Murray - ISI Group", "Thanks a lot. Can you spend a minute on cards? So you obviously have increased penetration impressively on the card side. Just a question: From penetration to actual usage, how long does it take? Obviously you guys have shown very solid loan growth on the card side. But how difficult, once they get a card from Wells, to get them to start using it, to move up the pecking order versus other cards?", "John Stumpf ", "This is an area that I think is one of our biggest opportunities in the company. If you look at Wells being as we all talk about in the real economy, we have leadership roles in variety of lending classes, whether autos, in consumer, small business, real estate and we are just passionate about helping our retail customers understand the value of having a Wells Fargo card and not only in their wallet but top of wallet. And there were some areas that we were under serving, especially our affluent and emerging affluent customers and our partnership with American Express is off to a very good start. Obviously, we do a lot of things, it was with VISA, and important in Master Card partners of ours. So we can sell a card to a customer at a fraction of the cost of someone else in the outside. We know these people better, we give them better products, and we have a lot of exciting benefits that we are giving as part of the card offering. And it is not only having the balances there. It's being involved with the customer on the payment side. So when we merge the two companies over five years ago, Wachovia came without a portfolio because he had sold their card business off so we are at about 22% penetration rate. Today we are at 39%. I always tell our people, do you know how many of our consumers have credit cards they all do. In fact, they have more than one card. Now, I don't know that we didn't get to 100% but we are marching smartly up the line and you are right, it is not only about the number of plastic cards we have outstanding, it is one that have been used. So I am thrilled with what we are doing. We have still lot more work to do. Big opportunity for us.", "John Shrewsberry ", "That's right. And it is both in the balances as well as interchange and utilization. ", "John Stumpf ", "And it just works beautifully. ", "Keith Murray - ISI Group", "Okay. Just switching gears to OLA, you had given us your thoughts on that on Investor Day. Obviously you guys issued some long-term debt this quarter. Do you feel like you're getting close to where you're going to wind up needing to be, for OLA? Or any updated thoughts and things you're hearing from Washington on that?", "John Shrewsberry ", "I wouldn't -- there is no real updated intelligence. We still are hearing and are of a mind that the range that will probably published at some point in the future is in the high teen to low 20s in terms of loss absorption cushion. We see ourselves on a risk based approached at the low end of that range and at or within striking distance of that range. So based on everything that we know today, we don't anticipate it having material impact on Wells Fargo.", "Keith Murray - ISI Group", " ", "Okay. And then just finally for me, we have read a lot about the SNC review and regulators focus on leveraged loans, etcetera. Just can you give us any thoughts related to that? And any changes you have seen this year in how the regulators are approaching it versus past years?", "John Shrewsberry ", "Well, they are talking about it lot and there is multiple regulators talking about it little differently so I think there is an effort to harmonize their points of view. But obviously they've got a big focus on what's going on with leverage lending inside of banks and banks mean different thing depending on which regulator and which firms are covering. So I would anticipate more clarity some time later this year or maybe beyond that but it really isn't enough for to understand what's going on and at some level to encourage certain types of behavior and discourage others. The big emphasis is on the most levered and most collateral free leverage lending. We don't anticipate having an extraordinary impact on Wells Fargo based on our business mix.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research ", "", "Hi, I was wondering if I could ask about deposit growth in the rising-rate scenario. And I guess if I oversimplify the two schools of thought or the two ends of the spectrum are deposits have only shrank industry wide in 2 of the past 90 years, and those were pretty marginal declines; so you can kind of bank on industry deposits growing. And then I guess JPMorgan was pretty explicit about the other end, where they feel like some of the need to drain liquidity out of the system as rates rise could drive deposits down as much as 10%. So I know there is a lot of uncertainty. Part of it depends on how the Fed acts. But as you think about liquidity planning and stress testing you do internally, any thoughts on the range of best-case and worst-case deposit growth you think about?", "John Stumpf ", "Let me just give overall view how we think about it. I think one of the things that -- is may be under appreciated about Wells today is the quality of our deposit franchise. And we have $1.1 Trillion of deposit at 10 basis points. About a $1 Trillion of core deposits and many of these -- most of these deposits what I would call transactional mean that people use these deposits either are they are checking accounts or saving accounts, we only have 30 to 40 billion [AR] of CDs, we have a very high quality deposit base. We are also growing primary checking accounts. Think about that. The primary account by between 4.5% and 5%, lower 5% depending whether it's small business or consumer. And in fact these some of the strongest growth number we-- I have ever seen. So because of the quality of our deposit franchise, the quality of omnichannel delivery system. And no one knows of course, it will become fact in history what happens with disintermediation about when rates rise and so forth. I am of the opinion that you are going to see at least for the first couple hundred basis points move up in rate, probably very little movement in disintermediation. You can make the argument that the squeeze down your M1 and M2 and some of the liquidity about the system. We found over time as you suggest early that deposit generally grow. And it might not grow as fast as but I am very confident about how all our deposit franchise will perform in a rising rate environment. ", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research ", "That's very helpful. Maybe on the student loan sale, what's your thought process on the decision to sell as opposed to I guess the alternative of just letting it gradually run down over time? Is it a capital free-up or a regulatory? Or what's the benefit of selling out of it now?", "John Shrewsberry ", "Sure. Well, we had designated -- that the government guaranteed student loan business which is distinct from our private student loan business that we are very committed to over the long term. We had separated after government guaranteed part of the portfolio into liquidating portfolio in 2010 when we stopped originating those loans as that market changed. So they have been part of our run off portfolio for that period of time and amortizing down a little bit. We see the opportunity in the market to move those loans off the book. They are relatively low yielding. They are not strategic. We don't have bigger relationships with most of those customers and that's the decision. So we have transferred them all to held for sale status to signal this intend to sell, we are going about the process in the next quarter or so.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research ", "If I could sneak a last one in on MSR hedging -- or I guess more specifically the line item you give of $475 million, the market-related valuation changes net of hedge results. I feel like -- I always strip that out of core EPS; I always set it at zero and then I always end up being too low. It's almost always a positive number. Is that a number that through the cycle you would expect to be kind of a wash? Or am I just missing that there is a carry component to it because of the way you structure the hedge and things like that? Through the cycle it actually -- over the past 5 years it's averaged $200 million a quarter. And there is a volatile component to it, but through the cycle it should be some positive nonzero number?", "John Shrewsberry ", "It is a carry component. The bundle of instrument that we use to hedge the asset to create the right duration profile as rates move up or down that we think the value is -- changing value is neutralized. That bundle of instruments throws out positive carry. It will depend on the shape or the slope of the yield curve at different points in time. And of course in the past it has been impacted by other expense items that have been flowing through, they are less of them today. So it is a little bit more standout in terms of its net. And then there is also the influence of what happens when rate speed up or down -- prepayment rates speed up or not, and of course we have gone through a period recently where the asset is linked-in. So there is a lot of different things going on there. And it is not currently what through the cycle actually mean in this context because as rates move you are in different places and as the shape of the curve moves you are in different places that are different than a business cycle or credit cycle. But you can look at the performance over some period of time and set whatever average you think is right. But I think zeroing it our is probably conservative. ", "Operator", "Your next question is will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks. Most of my questions have actually been asked and answered. But one quick thing, that the -- you have taken a big step up in capital return. Just talk a little bit about what might influence you to go to the very high end of your range or to the lower end of your range, in subsequent periods.", "John Shrewsberry ", "So we are setting our expectations in our levels internally from one key card process to the next based on how we anticipate that we are going to earn and the negotiation if you will that we are having with regulators which -- it is part of what constructs the balance between dividend and repurchase. And if you think about an annual payout or if we thought about an annual payout based on the annual number, it would be a calculated number in that range. From quarter-to-quarter as I mentioned earlier with respect to what happen to share count, we've got different things going on with share issuance so that the net buyback will be bigger in some quarter than it is in others which is going make us look like we are dancing around inside the range. And that's the reason for moving around inside the range. Now, more importantly if growth opportunities began to emerge in a more meaningful way where we needed to retain more capital to put it work then that would also be a driver, I think Investor Day you probably recall that Paul Ackerman went through an analysis of the amount of capital that we thought was appropriate to set aside for asset growth and that's amount that was -- the amount of earnings necessary are available to distribute. So that's the starting process. ", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Just as a follow-up to that, any thoughts on portfolio acquisition opportunities in the current environment? Anything standing out?", "John Shrewsberry", "I wouldn't say anything standing out. We are at there looking in both consumer and commercial and commercial real estate assets. We've -- I mentioned in the loan growth context that we have done a couple of commercial real estate acquisition. These are all announced but that have happened in the quarter. Pardon me, that is happened in previous quarters. So we are looking at those. We have talked about card programs like the Dillard's program where we will be picking up a portfolio receivable in addition to managing that card program going forward with more opportunity there. So we are looking at lots of things. Some things make more sense than others but that's an interesting way for us to add both assets and new customers to the bank. ", "Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse", "Got you. Very last thing. Just on that up sale, just two quick questions. Do you think you will sell it in one piece, or do you think you'd break it up into pieces? And do you service that portfolio?", "John Shrewsberry ", "With respect to the first half of the question it depends, we would be willing to sell at one piece. It is a big number. So it may happen in component pieces. And on the second half, we do not service those loans.", "Operator", "", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Market. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market", "Yes, thank you very much. On the mortgage production side, the $47 billion that you guys produced, how much did you sell into the MBS market, and how much did you portfolio?", "John Shrewsberry ", "I don't have that number handy. I think the lion share of that was sold. ", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market", "Okay. Do you have handy with you what was jumbo?", "John Shrewsberry ", "About $8 billion, nonconforming mortgages increased $8 billion to about $96 billion. ", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market", "Then my guess is you put portfolioed all those nonconforming jumbos.", "John Shrewsberry ", "That's correct. ", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market", " ", "Go ahead. ", "John Shrewsberry ", "The question is whether that $8 billion is part of the $47 billion because if it then that answers the question at what we sold. So we will confirm that. ", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market", " ", "Okay. That makes sense given the MBS issuance data that has been out. I don't have June; but given May and July I think you probably issued probably somewhere between 33 and 35, so that would coincide with some of that. Have you been portfolioing any conforming loans on your residential portfolio? Or has it just been nonconforming jumbos?", "John Shrewsberry ", "Nonconforming, not portfolio conforming. ", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market", "Yes. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing of the jumbos? Are they 4.25%, 4.5%? Are they mainly 7/1, 10/1s? Are you portfolioing any 30-year?", "John Shrewsberry", "So it's a mix 5/1, 7/1, 10/1 and 30 year and they are priced for their point on the curve.", "Operator", "Your next will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Good morning, John. John, how are you? As a happy Wells Fargo deposit customer, I got a letter in the mail several weeks ago, and I wanted to get your thoughts on it. It was changing the overdraft, no longer going from processing it from a high to low but going now to first received. I thought that already happened. I guess I was wrong. So I guess my question is: Will this have an impact on deposit service charges going forward with the change in the overdraft processing?", "John Stumpf ", "It is not going to be meaningful, no. ", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", "Okay. But has it happened in certain parts of the country? Because I'm here in Baltimore, Maryland; I thought it was the old Wachovia franchise. Has it happened in certain parts of the country? In other words the shift to first received and now we are converting other parts of the country? Or this is throughout the whole franchise?", "John Stumpf ", "Repeat that one. This is really as a process we are able to with debit; we are able to do it on a real time basis. And it was more incorporating that into that hierarchy with checks to get them synchronized and that was the reason for making that change. ", "Chris Mutascio - KBW", " ", "Okay. So again but the end result of that, this isn't any impact to deposit service charges going forward?", "John Stumpf ", "It is not to be meaningful. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "Good morning, guys. A question about the spring survey from the OCC, where they made some fairly pointed comments about deterioration in credit quality, not only in leveraged lending. I think there was sort of a loosening of loan standards; I mean, there were a whole bunch of bullet points that were somewhat alarming from a credit-quality standpoint. Do you guys see that this is at an inflection point in credit quality? And do you feel or are you feeling increased pressure to maybe start building reserves rather than continuing to let them draw down?", "John Shrewsberry ", "So at least two different questions there. The first part on the competitive environment for loan. And it is a more competitive environment. There are lots of people out there. Lots of banks out there with a lot of liquidity competing for loans. And we do see more competitive -- more borrower friendly structures that we have to react to from one asset category to another. Now in some like in mortgage for example, part of it is just getting more clarity on what the rules are and what's going to work and what's saleable to agencies and things like that. And for other things -- for other types of assets, we mentioned auto earlier, there are people out there who for example are extending the terms on auto loans, so links that you might not seen in past. And of course we are all leverage lending is probably the most visible because it's pretty easy to measure the aggressiveness based on leverage multiple for example. So those things are happening. Our front line and relationship managers and others are confronted with having to make decisions about where we want to be in, where we don't want to be. We think we are very good at spotting that. And managing credit risk has been strength at Wells Fargo as you know for a very long time. With respect to reserving, we are looking at our risk allowance for credit losses every quarter and it reflects and its change reflects what's going on in the portfolio. When its bottom up analysis of what's in the portfolio, what it looks like, what's risk rated, how it is performing and what our expectations is for near term credit losses. And as we said here, we anticipate reserve releases declining over some period of time in part to reflect -- from 35 basis points it's hard to argue that whether it can get much better from there or sort of bounded by zero on the one side and would expect to gravitate more towards some whatever normalized means with some higher level of net charge-off. So that's going on the one hand and then there is portfolio growth. As we said, we had a lot of new loans put on and all things being equal at some point, our reserves will have to grow to reflect the increased loan balances which we think is a great thing because we want those loans on the books serving customers, earning interest and creating the environment to cross sell those customers. That's how I see them. ", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "Do you think you will have an ability to telegraph the change that will actually happen when you have to start building reserves? Because my guess is that the industry is going to be -- or Wall Street is going to be somewhat shocked when that starts to happen.", "John Shrewsberry ", "As I look at the industry data so what's going on with reserve releases from other banks, they have been trending and it begun to trend with a few exceptions back up towards zero. So I think people see that coming and it's a reflection of asset growth on one hand which is a good thing and then of course the big reserves that we put on at the -- in the heat of the crisis that in some cases were more than relative what was necessary. So we look at quarter-by-quarter, just to be clear, this is a gap exercise, we built it up based on what's actually in the portfolio and the experience that we are managing. As you have seen in the data right now our allowance for credit loss is pushing 5x what our actual charge-off experience is right now.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Good morning, guys. Thanks. Just a couple follow-ups here. Just to be clear on the line of questioning from Nancy on credit quality, so just looking -- it feels like, to your point, maybe it's hard to get much better than 35 basis points in aggregate and recovery seem to be less robust and maybe it's a very modest uptick in C&I. Like, how should we think about the level? I mean, should we think about it in this very low range for a period of time, and we're still very far from what you've previously deemed as normalized, the 75 to 85 basis points? How should we think about maybe that near-term?", "John Shrewsberry ", "", "I think it's going to be hard for the 35 basis points to move rapidly to any much higher number. And we know what kind of assets we have been putting on the book for the last few years which I think we all believe are very high credit quality particularly on a historical basis. So normalization will happen over some period of time but at least from our perspective we wouldn't expect it to be an abrupt move. Credit is still quite strong.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Got it. Then just a little ticky-tack on the reserving. So not only for the loan growth that's picking up and relief from legacy issues for the industry, there is also this upcoming change in accounting at some point. Any update or thoughts on the CECL coming through, and when one might need to start thinking about that for the industry in general?", "John Shrewsberry ", "Yes. So what we know about that is that it sounds like it is going to happen. It is not final but we are going to be hearing about it from the Fed in the coming quarters. And at least the way I read it there is not going to be much of an opportunity to change anyone's mind. But of course for anybody who is included into this, this is life of low-- essentially life of loan reserving. The expectation, our expectation is that would begin to phase in the 2017 timeframe or later. And so it's not really today's issue and just for the avoidance of doubt, our reserving practices today do not reflect that future contemplated life of reserving -- life of loan loss approach. So it's out there, let's call it 2017 plus and something wrong and have to figure out how to adapt to. ", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Great, that's helpful. Then lastly just following on the balance sheet dynamic questions and the NIM optics and issues around deposits. Can you maybe just re-clarify in terms of deposit velocity in a higher rate environment that Brian had brought up earlier? How much -- I mean, do you if at all consider ring-fencing 5%, 10%, 15% of deposits maybe at risk of reversing in a higher rate environment as some institutions have indicated?", "John Shrewsberry ", "I wouldn't say that we don't describe it in our deposit stress testing internally in quite that way. And we talk about the types of deposit accounts that we have and we assigned what we think are the right level of behaviors to those accounts and through that we assess what we think the right level of liquidity is to carry and that liquidity comes in the form both of cash and cash equivalent which are extraordinary at Wells Fargo today as well as our securities are relatively liquid securities portfolio that we in a pinch would consider to be saleable or financeable. And answering a slightly different question, the sum of those two things is such a significant part of our balance sheet today that it seems like ample coverage for whatever portion of deposits might be -- might unexpected retract or disappear in the event of move up. ", "John Stumpf ", "And I think as I mentioned before I think we are going -- our deposit franchise will out perform competitors because of the nature of the kind of deposits we have and the amount of core deposits (inaudible) amount of retail core and I think there is going to be surprise, I think we will surprise ourselves and how well it's going to do. ", "John Shrewsberry ", "That's right. We have the relationships that we have with our deposit customers is cemented by the tools that we have that we use, that the products that we offer them and allow them to manage their money. So whether it's a consumer or a business customer, we've got the best in class interface that allows them -- and frankly it is hard to move away from -- in terms of moving money, analyzing money, investing money etcetera, the mobile convenience, the online convenience what we have referred to as this omnichannel relationship. It's not easy or convenient to want to change that. So something really has to be compelling about an individual depositor circumstances or we would have to really be tone deaf to what deposit pricing needs to do in order to retain our balances. So we feel really good about that.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", "Thanks, that's helpful. Then if you don't mind, just in terms of -- you've mentioned a couple quarters now how you've had this great continued growth in core deposits. But it's optically impacted the NIM but hasn't really negatively impacted the NII. Would a similar dynamic be envisioned in a higher rate environment if in fact the velocity was greater than one envisioned? In terms of it could go the other way and you could have an optically better net interest margin; but the NII could remain relatively stable despite all that. Or how should we think about that? Or how do you think about that?", "John Stumpf ", "What's happened in the past is typically what happen is that the margin will increase and net interest income increase because assets have reprised faster than liabilities will. So I mean \u2013 hypothetically we will wait to see what happens at that time.", "Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners", " ", "Got it, great, thank you, guys. ", "John Stumpf ", "All right.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our strong results in the third quarter reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and were driven by our continued focus on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs in the real economy.", "Let me highlight our growth during the third quarter compared with a year ago. We generated earnings of $5.7 billion and earnings per share of $1.02, both up 3%. We grew net interest income and non-interest income, resulting in 4% revenue growth; and our efficiency ratio improved to 57.7%.", "Pretax pre-provision profit increased 7%. We had strong broad-based loan growth with our core loan portfolio up almost $51 billion or 7%. Our credit performance continued to be excellent with the net charge-off ratio declining to only 32 basis points on average loans on an annualized basis. We had a $300 million reserve release this quarter, down from $900 million a year ago. In fact in my 32 plus years with the company, I have not seen credit better.", "Our deposit franchise continued to generate strong customer and balance growth with total deposits up $89 billion or 9%. We grew primary consumer checking customers by 4.9% and primary small business and business checking customers by 5.6%. This level of business performance has enabled us to maintain strong capital levels even while returning more capital to our shareholders through a higher dividends and share repurchases. We returned a net $3.6 billion to our shareholders in the third quarter, up 29% from a year ago.", "Before I turn it over to John Shrewsberry, our CFO, I\u2019d like to take a minute or two and share some of my thoughts on the economy and the housing market. While the path to a full economic recovery remains uneven, including the volatility we\u2019ve seen recently and the current low rate environment provides some challenges, I am very optimistic about the future. The U.S. economy added 248,000 jobs last month, the 48 straight monthly employment gain tying the record for the longest consecutive string of job gains ever.", "There are currently more job openings than at any time since early 2001. Household wealth is at an all-time high and after years of paying down debt, the consumer debt burden is at the lowest level in over 30 years. Consumers are now better positioned for increased spending and borrowing.", "The U.S. economy is also benefiting from the increasing domestic oil and gas productions, which is at the highest level in almost 30 years and rising fast, up 14% over the past year. Fiscal conditions have improved at all levels of government, and government payrolls are once again on the rise for the first time this decade.", "Historically, most recoveries in this country have been led by housing. While the residential real estate market has definitely gotten better, which is good for the U.S. economy, it has not fully recovered. I believe there are several factors holding the housing market back from a complete recovery.", "First, household formation is slower than it has been in the past. Second, national student debt balances have increased leading less money available to pay for our mortgage. Third, in some markets, inventory is not available especially in coastal areas. Finally, credit is still not obtainable for all qualified borrowers due in part to the credit overlays that many mortgage lenders, including Wells Fargo use to help reduce repurchase risk.", "Despite these challenges, a recent survey we conducted showed that home ownership is still an aspiration for 95% of respondents. Home prices are up 7% over the past year and I believe the housing market will continue its recovery driven by pent-up demand and affordability that even with the increase in home prices is still far better than the historical average. These trends are all positive for our country, our customers, our shareholders, as well as Wells Fargo and we continue our service to the real economy.", "Now John Shrewsberry, CFO will provide more details on our third quarter results.", "John?", "John Shrewsberry", "Thanks John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplements starting on page two. John and I will then answer your questions. Wells Fargo had another strong quarter earning $5.7 billion and growing EPS to $1.02. Generating this level of consistent earnings while economic growth has been uneven and interest rates have remained low, demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model. We grew both revenue and pre-tax, pre-provision profit from second quarter and have grown pretax pre-provision profit for four consecutive quarters.", "Our results also reflected solid loan and deposit growth that was diversified across our businesses. Our capital levels remained strong even as we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.", "As John highlighted and as you can see on page three, we had strong year-over-year growth across a number of important business drivers. We grew net interest income amidst the persistent low rate environment with strong earning asset growth; and our ability to grow non-interest income by $542 million or 6% from a year ago even as mortgage originations declined by 40%, demonstrates the benefit of our diversified sources of fee income.", "Page four highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. We have over 90 businesses and in any given quarter, some will drive more revenue growth than others. For example, the strength in the markets over the past few years has benefited our market sensitive businesses. Market sensitive revenue was 5% of our total revenue in the third quarter, up from 4% in the second quarter but lower than the 7% contribution in the first quarter.", "Let me highlight some key drivers of our third quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on page five. Our balance sheet has never been stronger; we\u2019ve increased our liquidity position, improved the quality of our assets and hold more capital. Furthermore, while we\u2019re positioned to benefit from rising rates, we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results if rates remain low.", "Investment securities increased $9.9 billion from the second quarter with $25 billion of purchases partially offset by run-off. We issue $16.3 billion of liquidity related long-term debt as well as some additional liquidity related short-term funding during the third quarter. We are now solidly over 100% for the LCR, but keep in mind that the LCR is a minimum requirement. We have a significant amount of cash available to deploy, both to meet our customers\u2019 financial needs and to opportunistically purchase high quality assets.", "Turning to the income statement on page six, revenue grew $147 million during the quarter with growth in net interest income and stable non-interest income. I will highlight the drivers of revenue growth in more detail later, but let me take a moment now to highlight the growth in market sensitive revenue which increased $231 million from second quarter.", "Net gains from debt securities were up $182 million as we sold securities, primarily non-agency MBS as part of our ongoing balance sheet management. Net gains from equity investments were up $263 million from second quarter, reflecting strong results in our venture capital businesses, but were down a $135 million from first quarter.", "We\u2019ve been in these core businesses for decades and results are naturally cyclical and driven by market conditions. Non-controlling interest reduces the impact of the equity gains to our net income and increased $166 million from second quarter. The increase in market sensitive revenue from debt and equity gains was partially offset by $214 million of lower trading gains, the decline in trading reflected $163 million of lower deferred compensation plan investment results which was offset in employee benefits expense and lower customer accommodation trading.", "Our results this quarter also reflected $227 million of lower income tax expense from the second quarter, reflecting tax benefits primarily due to charitable donations of appreciated securities.", "As shown on page seven, we continued to have strong broad-based loan growth in the third quarter, our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core portfolio grew by $50.8 billion or 7% from a year ago and was up $12.2 billion or 6% annualized from the second quarter. Our liquidating portfolio was down $21 billion from a year ago and is now only 8% of our total loans, down from 10% a year ago. Average loan yields have remained relatively stable over the past year and were up one basis point from second quarter.", "On page eight, we highlighted a number of our loan portfolios that had strong year-over-year growth. C&I loans were up $23.8 billion or 13% from a year ago with diversified growth that I\u2019ll highlight on the next page. We\u2019re the largest commercial real-estate lender in the country and we\u2019re benefiting from the growth in new construction. Our commercial real-estate portfolio grew $3.1 billion from a year ago.", "Foreign loans grew $700 million or 2% from a year ago, reflecting growth in trade finance and the UK commercial real-estate acquisition we completed in the third quarter of last year. Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $16.4 billion or 9% from a year ago with growth in high quality non-conforming mortgages, primarily jumbo loans. The credit quality of our core mortgage portfolio was outstanding with only seven basis points of loss in the third quarter.", "We\u2019re the number one auto lender in the country. Auto loans were up $5.5 billion or 11% from last year, reflecting strong originations. Credit card balances were up $2.8 million or 11% from a year ago, benefiting from continued account growth.", "Slide nine demonstrates the diversity of the businesses that contributed to the growth in C&I loans; let me highlight just a few. Asset-backed finance increased $5.3 billion with increased utilization and new originations across all asset classes. Corporate banking grew $4.4 billion, driven by new customer growth and higher utilization rates from existing customers. And commercial banking serving our middle market customers grew $3.8 billion with diversified growth across geographies and industries.", "As you can see on page 10, average deposits totaled $1.1 trillion in the third quarter, up $25.6 billion from second quarter with growth in both commercial and consumer balances. Due to our outstanding deposit franchise, we\u2019ve been able to grow deposits over 5% on a year-over-year basis every quarter since the third quarter of 2011. Our primary consumer checking customers were up 4.9% from a year ago and we grew primary small business and business banking checking customers by 5.6%. Our average deposit costs were 10 basis points in the third quarter, consistent with second quarter and 2 basis points lower than a year ago.", "Our NIM declined 9 basis points from the second quarter, 4 basis points of this decline was from strong customer driven deposit growth because excess deposits remain invested in cash equivalents in the current environment. Deposit growth put pressure on the NIM, but was basically neutral to net interest income. Liquidity-related actions both term deposits and long-term debt also diluted the margin by 4 basis points. The impact of all other balance sheet growth and reprising was again minimal this quarter, reducing the margin by one basis point.", "Despite the decline in the net interest margin, we continue to grow net interest income on a tax equivalent basis, up $147 million from the second quarter as a result of the growth in earning assets, higher PCI accretion and one additional day in the quarter. Our balance sheet is asset-sensitive, so we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from higher rates, but we\u2019re not relying on rates to increase in order to generate growth. As we have demonstrated in this historically low rate environment, we believe we can grow net interest income overtime even if rates remain low.", "While total non-interest income was unchanged from the second quarter, we had growth across a number of business drivers including deposit service charges, retail brokerage, trust and investment management, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage and the market-sensitive revenue that I highlighted earlier.", "This growth was offset by lower investment banking fees, which declined 24% from second quarter consistent with the decline in the market people [ph]. Insurance was down $65 million reflecting the impact from the sale of 40 offices last quarter and also seasonality in the crop insurance business.", "Other non-interest income was down $95 million from second quarter, which had included the gain from the sale of the insurance offices. Mortgage banking revenue declined $90 million from second quarter. Mortgage origination gains were up $266 million from last quarter primarily due to gain on sale margins increasing to 182 basis points and higher mortgage repurchase reserve release.", "The majority of our originations were tied to purchase activity, 70% originations in the third quarter, up from 59% a year ago. We currently expect originations to be down in the fourth quarter reflecting normal seasonality in the purchase market. Servicing income declined $356 million from second quarter; approximately one-half of this decline was from higher unreimbursed direct servicing products, which reduced gross servicing fee. The rest of the decline was driven by lower net mortgage servicing rights results reflecting lower carry and hedging gains. Our gain on sale margin is expected to remain within the range we\u2019ve seen over the past four quarters.", "As shown on page 13, expenses were up $54 million from second quarter, while our efficiency ratio improved to 57.7%. We\u2019ve consistently worked to improving our efficiency which has enabled us to maintain a high level of customer service, while we\u2019ve continue to appropriately invest in our businesses.", "We\u2019ve been significantly increasing our investments in our already strong risk management practices. Our quarterly expenses related to risk and compliance have increased by approximately $100 million over the past year and we\u2019ve added over 1,500 team members in this area.", "Additionally, operating losses in the third quarter were $417 million, primarily reflecting litigation accruals. We expect our efficiency ratio will remain within our target range of 55% to 59% in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to our business segments starting on page 14, community banking earned $3.5 billion in the third quarter, up 4% from a year ago and up 1% from second quarter. By consistently providing outstanding customer service with the convenience of the most extensive store network in the country, an award winning mobile and online banking, we\u2019ve had strong net household growth.", "In fact, August was our strongest month for net retail bank household growth in over three years. These additional households will help drive our future growth as we focus on offering customers the products and services they need to help them succeed financially.", "Our results continued to benefit from growth in our debit and credit card business. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago driven by primary checking customer growth and increased usage from existing customers. Credit card purchase volume grew 16% from a year ago. We\u2019ve continued to increase our credit card penetration rate growing from 36% a year ago to 39.7% and our new customers are spending more and transacting at a greater frequency.", "By consistently focus on meeting the financial needs of our small business customers, Wells Fargo has been America\u2019s number one lender to small businesses for 12 consecutive years. We do business with 1 in 10 small businesses and grew primary business checking customers by 5.6% from a year ago.", "Wholesale banking earned $1.9 billion in the third quarter, down 3% from a year ago and 2% from second quarter. While earnings were down, there were number of underlying trends that demonstrated business momentum. Loan growth remained strong, up $28.8 billion or 10% from a year ago with growth across many businesses as I highlighted earlier.", "Credit quality remained outstanding with seven consecutive quarters of net recoveries. Deposit growth was also strong with average core deposits of $43.1 billion or 18% from a year ago with diversified growth across wholesale businesses. Wholesale banking cross-sell increased to 7.2 products per relationship, up from 7.0 a year ago. And treasury management grew revenue by 9% from a year ago, reflecting new product sales and re-pricing.", "Wealth, brokerage and retirement earned $550 million in the third quarter, up 22% from a year ago and 1% from second quarter. Year-over-year results were driven by strong revenue growth up 7% with increases in both net interest income and non-interest income. Asset-based fees increased 18% from a year ago, reflecting increased market valuation and net flows. WBR results continue to benefit from strong loan growth, up 13% from a year ago driven by growth in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans and security-based lending. This was WBR\u2019s fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth.", "Turning to page 17, credit quality continued to improve with charge-offs at historic lows. Our new charge-off ratio declined to just 32 basis points with average loans; consumer losses were 62 basis points and commercial loans had a net recovery of two basis points. The improvement in our asset quality reflected the benefit of the improving economy and our continued focus on originating high quality loans. For example, approximately 57% of the consumer first mortgage portfolio was originated after 2008 when new underwriting standards were implemented.", "Non-performing assets have declined for eight consecutive quarters and were down $406 million from second quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $607 million while foreclosed assets increased $201 million driven by higher government ensured or guaranteed properties, primarily in judicial states.", "The reserve release was $300 million in the third quarter, down $200 million from the second quarter and down $600 million from a year ago. We continue to expect future reserve releases absent a significant deterioration in the economy but expect a lower level of future releases as the rate of credit improvement slows and the loan portfolio continues to grow.", "Our capital level has remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach fully phased in at 10.46% in the third quarter. While the amount of RWA we determined under the standardized and advanced approaches has been converging, our ratio this quarter was determined under the advanced approach because RWA under the advanced approach was higher.", "As shown on slide 19, our strong capital levels have allowed us to return more capital to our shareholders. We returned $3.6 billion to shareholders in the third quarter and our net payout ratio is 66% in the third quarter within our target range of 55% to 75%. Our common shares outstanding declined by 34.9 million shares in the quarter, the largest decline in over six years. We purchased 48.7 million common shares and entered into a $1 billion forward repurchase contract that\u2019s expected to settle in the fourth quarter for approximately 19.8 million shares. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 58.7 million shares from a year ago and expect further reductions in the fourth quarter.", "In summary, our results in the third quarter reflect the benefit of our diversified business model which has enabled us to produce strong and consistent results over a variety of economic and interest rate environments. Our results were driven by strong loan and deposit growth, and we grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profits. We increased our capital levels and returned more capital to shareholders. We continued to execute against all of the targets we established at Investor Day operating within our stated ranges for ROA, ROE, efficiency ratio and capital return.", "Our balance sheet has never been stronger reflecting higher capital liquidity levels and improved asset quality. While we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from increased economic activity and higher rates, as we\u2019ve demonstrated by our consistent financial performance in a variety of environments, we\u2019re not depending on the economy improving or rate rising to generate strong results. I\u2019m optimistic about our future opportunities as we continue to focus on serving customers and growing relationships.", "I will now open up the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes, good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning.", "John Shrewsberry", "Good morning.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "John, my first question is on the net interest income and net interest margin. We hear you loud and clear in terms of the message with regards to the NII trajectory. As we think about the net interest margin going forward given the stability of your loan yield over the past three quarters and your funding cost also stable over the past three quarters. Is really there is the incremental hit on the margin in this rate environment really going to come from deposit flow given that you did issued $16 billion in debt in the quarter for liquidity purposes already?", "John Stumpf", "So that\u2019s probably true and it also has a lot to do with what we choose to do with the access deposits or frankly access funding as it sits on our balance sheet. We\u2019re making choices between leaving that liquidity in cash equivalents setting at the Fed or deploying it in the HQLA or loans for that matter if there enough demand for it or other assets with yields. And we\u2019re making those determinations based on how we feel about entry points in the market and what we think it does to our capital sensitivity in the event of a backup subsequently and it\u2019s those types of choices that are going to drive us to increase the all-in yield on the west side of the balance sheet, whether the funding is coming from deposits or from term funding.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And my second question is given Governor Tarullo\u2019s speech early in the September, there are clearly two ruling issues where the industry that may not be as relevant to Wells. Higher CET 1 buffers relative to your short-term funding base and also the interpretation of NSSR by over rules by Basel. Do you see advantage given where you are on both the business mix and capital spectrum to perhaps take advantage of players that need to have more stringent buffers mainly in terms of continuing to grow market share in wholesale banking?", "John Stumpf", "It\u2019s possible. On both of the measures we think we end up at the low-end of the risk-adjusted spectrum in terms of the bad outcomes that occur. And that might give us an opportunity to do a little bit more for our customers if they needed and if the risk-adjusted returns are appropriate.", "I think that the -- we\u2019re all waiting to see what happens to the returns in those businesses based on the actions taken by people who are constrained by both of those -- who are more constrained by both of those new ratios. What it means for pricing, what it means for our customer behavior et cetera. But we\u2019re happy with the approach that we\u2019ve taken and we\u2019re here to serve the customers that we have. And, but you are right, we\u2019re probably at the more advantaged end of the spectrum with respect to both of those measures.", "John Shrewsberry", "", "Yes. Erika I said, to add to that, nothing that\u2019s happening to-date and nothing that we see in the horizon will allow will get in our way or impede our way to help customers and to serve them. And I think that puts us in a very good position.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, I\u2019ll step-off. Thank you for taking my questions.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Hi, good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Hi.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "John I appreciate your color on reminding us about that minority interest back out on some of the trading related activities. But just wondering if you can help us understand from those portfolios that still generate a healthy amount of fee income, what\u2019s kind of left in it still there if you think across net gains from trading activities debt securities and net gains from equity investment sort of question that comes up frequently with the investment community?", "John Stumpf", "Sure. Well, there are variety of different businesses that contribute to those results. So the big drivers would be our -- the venture activity that we have, the Norwest Venture Partners, it would be the activity of investment banking where we\u2019ve got customer combination trading. It\u2019s the impact of the hedging that we do for our deferred comp program and then there is, at least in this quarter and probably in future quarters some amount of balance sheet management on the debt portfolio. And they all contribute.", "So it\u2019s a diversified set of investments, different drivers in each case, some of them are more sensitive to where we are in the rate cycles, some of them are more sensitive to where we are in the equity valuation cycle. But they\u2019ve contributed more or less you\u2019ll call it 4%, 5% to 7% or 8% over a number of quarters. And there isn\u2019t one thing that I would hang on, I\u2019d think of them as being core to our business results in different ways, but over the long-term.", "John Shrewsberry", "Ken? And John mentioned that within those business decades, actually a lot of decades, 50 years, so this with respect to venture and equity partners, so these are long term businesses for us.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "", "Yes. And I think that\u2019s the point which is that you don\u2019t see any growth coming as far as the ability to continue to realize either gains or benefits from those activities and there is some countercyclical pieces within it as well?", "John Stumpf", "They are part of what\u2019s a broader set of diversified non-interest income whatever it is. So whether they\u2019re contributing 4% or 7% as it has been in recent history and how they work in sync with all of the other things that are going on in terms of customer facing fee generating activity that is the diversified model.", "And as I mentioned, some of them are more interest rate sensitive and were in a low rate environment, so there is higher unrealized gains. Some of them are levered to equity markets and exit strategies for portfolio investments. But I would think of them as part of the broader mix of diversified non-interest income sources.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "", "Understood. And my next question is just on the expense side, understanding that you\u2019re going to still be living in this some 55%, 59% range, we did see kind of flattish fee side, a little bit NII growth but then a little bit of higher expenses as well. And I\u2019m just wondering as you think about that level of expenses and continue to manage forward in what\u2019s still looking to be a pretty tough rate environment and these ongoing challenges from NIM pressures, any adjustments that you\u2019re thinking about or contemplating as far as just kind of the need to continue to manage that expense base even tighter than you\u2019ve already been and where would opportunities be so?", "John Stumpf", "", "We\u2019re always trying to be as efficient as we can to make sure that we have the resources available to deliver what customers need. And of course as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019re at a time when the focus in the investment, in the risk management area is very high. So we\u2019re working constantly to try and be as efficient as we can and in areas where it won\u2019t impact customers and where it doesn\u2019t hinder us in terms of our risk management activity.", "Some examples, which we\u2019ve talked about a little bit before are really in other areas, for example the space that we consume, the way we think about our purchasing, the technology that we use et cetera. We can always be a little bit more efficient. And it\u2019s a constant job here to try and make the most of that.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "But you guys haven\u2019t felt that incremental compliance burden increasing to a level where you feel the need to pull the continuous improvement cord?", "John Stumpf", "I think we are pulling the continuous improvement cord and in part, because we\u2019re spending more in compliance and risk management, like we\u2019re spending more in our -- in the customer experience and our customer facing activity. But in order to afford both of those things, we have to be really vigilant around the business as usual expenses; and that\u2019s continuous improvement.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Understood, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, good morning. John, question on the mortgage revenues; on the servicing side, the growth servicing revenues are down about 200 million, you mentioned the unreimbursed servicing costs. Is that for your one-timers that the pop-up and those, it seems like those were coming down from a while and then they\u2019ve kind of reversed this quarter, that just bounced around or any color you can give on that?", "John Stumpf", "It had come down; it bounced back up. Our sense is that trajectory is going to be reduced over the longer ark of the mortgage servicing cycle; it\u2019s going to be hard to forecast it quarter-to-quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t expect it as low as it\u2019s been for the last couple of quarters, this maybe a more average quarter. And over some period of time as the level of non-performing loans, foreclosed assets et cetera begins to abate then you\u2019d expect that to raced itself down, but this is probably a relatively normal level.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And in terms of capital on the advanced approach, you mentioned the RWA kind of ratio to total assets seems like it got a little better on better credit quality and data refinements. Any more color on that? Is that something that also just kind of bounces around quarter-to-quarter or we still have some model improvements you can do from here?", "John Stumpf", "There is always more that we can do with improved and more focus on data and modeling. But you could come to a point where just because of the nature of our assets, loans and securities that attract the risk weights that they do that were constrained on the standardized side. So, and we mentioned that they are converging, they are very close together right now in terms of the RWA calculation. But the takeaway is that our capital level did increase a little bit in the quarter under the advanced approach. And in spite of that, we\u2019re still earning north of 13% as an ROA, which we\u2019re very proud of.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "And that stuff that just rolled off in terms of the better credit-quality like older assets that roll off, is that why it\u2019s getting better?", "John Stumpf", "It\u2019s a combination of roll off and hard work around data and modeling and continuous refinement.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "And with that ratio at 10.46 is this the kind of level that you want to run at on Tier 1 common?", "John Stumpf", "Tough to say. As we said in Investor Day, this is probably in excess of the buffer that we might have imagined when we originally vectored in toward our regulatory capital levels. And it\u2019s really a function of CCAR and some of the assumptions that are made in the CCAR process as it is applied. So as we go from CCAR to CCAR and we present our starting capital point, we present our expected capital generation and our capital actions and what they yield in terms of capital levels, we\u2019re trying to manage that as appropriately as we can to got the right amount of return back to shareholders, which we believe that we\u2019ve done at a 66% payout ratio. But it\u2019s an art form because of all of the inputs and the other actors in the process.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up to Erika\u2019s question on the liquidity building, it sounds like you\u2019re now above the minimums of your calculations, but you might decide to build some buffer going forward, so we might expect a little bit more on that front from you?", "John Stumpf", "So I think we\u2019re in a period where big banks are trying to figure out what the right buffer is as a result of our own internal stress testing and the expectations on G-SIBs in particular. So we\u2019re in the phase. We feel great about where we are right now. Nobody has mentioned [deal lack] yet, but there is some work to do to figure out where we\u2019re going on that front and how that -- what the interplay is between liquidity we\u2019ve already built and what future requirements are going to be. So I think that heavy lifting is probably behind us for the time being. But I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re stopped.", "John Shrewsberry", "And John, one of the strengths of the company of course is our continued ability to grow high quality, low cost core deposits, which is critical in all of this.", "John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "John Stumpf", "Thanks John.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Hey guys.", "John Stumpf", "Hey Matt.", "John Shrewsberry", "Hey Matt.", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Just wanted to open some of the rate related questions earlier, this was not a Wells specific issue, but you are the first of kind of the original banks to come out. If the tenure does stay, right now it\u2019s sitting at 2 to 2.2, my screen shows. Is this meaningful as we think about I guess, both the NIM and then could there be some opportunities on refis if we stay down here for a little bit?", "John Shrewsberry", "I don\u2019t know if that gets us back in the money refi scenario, but probably still some distance away from that. I think that it is meaningful than it\u2019s more about the expectation that how long rates stay low because that will influence the decision to redeploy cash equivalents into assets with duration. And if you imagine that term rates are going to back up in the foreseeable future, just from a capital preservation perspective, you\u2019re probably less likely to redeploy out of cash and into higher earning assets. And so that\u2019s the calculus and the judgment that we make here relatively regularly and it feels frankly like the market is now discounting the idea that there is any sort of meaningful move up in rates in the 2015 timeframe.", "So if we\u2019re going to be lower for longer, I think it means a lot for banks like ours and it could mean you have to be that much more vigilant on expenses. I think it means you have to think about how your assets are deployed and how much cash you think you really need to carry. And we\u2019ll be conducting that balance between the risk to capital if rates back up and the risk to earnings if rates stay low or underinvested.", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then I guess a somewhat related theme spread pressure in the commercial lending business. We saw your yields down about 10 bps quarter-to-quarter. And I guess there is two phenomenon that\u2019s going on. One, the new loans that you\u2019re adding at lower spreads just generally speaking for the industry but then maybe some loans that you did a few years ago are coming up for renewal and there is some de-pricing there. Maybe just talk about like which of those two is a bigger driver at this point, how should we think about other dynamics in that book?", "John Stumpf", "I don\u2019t know which of those two drove the 10 basis-point drop in this quarter or who was a greater contributor to that drop in this quarter. It is a competitive environment out there. We\u2019re happy to be able to have a full toolkit when we square off with our commercial customers because we\u2019re in a position to earn more of their business and to generate more of a return on the risk capital that\u2019s associated with the loan that we\u2019re going to make. We contrast ourselves with some other firms that we compete with who are getting paid primarily from the loan yield itself enough from the broader relationship. So we like our competitive stance in that range. We have backed away from the table in some situations, not so much on price, but where we see credit or terms getting a little bit frothy, because that\u2019s another lever that people pull in order to compete for these types of assets.", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Any signs of stabilization in that spread or just still in (inaudible)?", "John Stumpf", "I think at some level, it\u2019s got to be stabilized by the marginal player who is only getting a return from the asset itself, because there are levels below which they can\u2019t go, because they\u2019re not going to generate a sufficient return on capital. And they have no other cards to play in terms of generating relationship returns by providing product or service. And some of the smaller banks who participate in those markets would be examples of that.", "Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "John Stumpf", "Hello Joe.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning John and John.", "John Shrewsberry", "Hey, Joe.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "I guess looking at your new C&I slide on page nine, how much of your growth do you think is coming from market share gains as opposed to increased demand? And along those lines, last quarter you talked about seeing increased confidence among business owners. Is that still the case generally?", "John Stumpf", "Well, speaking for market share gains, it depends on which column in that slide you\u2019re talking about. We have leading market share and our increasing share in some of those businesses; and some of them, they might include examples of businesses where we\u2019ve chosen to slow down a little bit, if the competition\u2019s got racy. So it\u2019s a combination of things, of both market share growth and of the size of the market increasing.", "So, Joe, if you look at more than just commercial customers broadly, there has actually been fairly good activity, now there has been volatility lately in the market, but if you look auto sales and we participate in that business of course, August was the biggest sales month, maybe in I don\u2019t know how many years. Consumers, our credit card activities are increasing. We\u2019re doing -- we had growth in our mortgage portfolio. So, it\u2019s very broad-based.", "And when I\u2019m out calling customers, corporate customers, middle-market customers, there seems to be more -- at least more discussion about activity. And the marketplace is not totally ubiquitous; there is places that are stronger, and energy for example and those places are really doing well; [Agus] having a pretty good year; technology. It depends on what part the requirement is. But core I see and I hear more optimism than I heard a year ago for example.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. I guess lastly just can you share with us any thoughts on Apple Pay and how readily you see it being adopted and what sort of impact it may have on the broader payments business?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, as you know, we are participating in that. And there are I think 7 million to 8 million [terminals] merchants out of the marketplace and only a few hundred thousand have the NFC chip in them and that you need that the near field communication chip. So, this will take, there will be an adoption but we\u2019re pleased and excited on behalf of our customers to participate in that. And it will evolve over time.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Hey couple of questions. One was on the two that you did mention, there obviously is something that you\u2019re in the review of. I think the expectation is that in the U.S. at least we\u2019ll have to have senior through common 20% to 25% of risk weighted assets. And if you\u2019re on the high-end of that range, can you give us a sense of what you might do to minimize any impact?", "John Stumpf", "There is still a lot to know. We\u2019re seeing similar headline numbers, maybe a little bit lower, 19.5 to 23.5. And this is all research that\u2019s been published based on information that\u2019s in the market that hasn\u2019t beneficially sanctioned. So who knows? And over what period of time it has to get phased in is unknown. What counts, what doesn\u2019t count among your existing capital structure is unknown. What -- which entities that you issue out of and whether there are going to be caps on those types of things. So there is a handful of questions that are unknown.", "Our sense is that we\u2019re going to end up at the lower end of the range. We calculate that we probably have about 18% today that qualifies and for the end up having the issue we\u2019ll probably be issuing a form of senior unsecured mostly Holdco debt. And it will happen over some period of time. And it will end up being an earnings drag because we\u2019ll issue that debt and pay our corporate spread and we\u2019ll take that cash and we\u2019ll reinvest it in some more yielding either HQLA or equivalent. And it will become a new part of the cost structure and capital structure of bank.", "So, my short answer is there is still a lot to know, but we\u2019ll deal with it when it comes and it doesn\u2019t seem instrumental.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Right. And there is no rush to get it done quickly, right, I mean I think it\u2019s -- you have until 01/01/19?", "John Stumpf", "Don\u2019t know yet, but I\u2019ve heard it similarly that it will be a longish raise in period.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Then two other quick questions, one is on the auto business. You highlighted that you are nation\u2019s largest bank lender of auto and wanted to understand how you\u2019re thinking about that given the risk retention rules that are out there, clearly it\u2019s just a proposal so it\u2019s not fully baked yet but this outline that you have to at sometime in the future hold 5% of any securitizations that you do in auto. Does that matter to you?", "John Stumpf", "It doesn\u2019t matter to us in our current business model because we don\u2019t securitize our auto loans; we own 100% of the risk on every one of them. And frankly in the auto loan securitization business for those who do use securitization that\u2019s the general business model which is that people own the bottom of the capital structure and retain their own risk which is different than mortgage, but that\u2019s how auto finance companies generally works. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to have a real impact on Wells Fargo.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Right. And obviously from the perspective of the competitive dynamic if there were a committed play?", "John Stumpf", "Well, to the extent that it makes harder for other people to compete and that could be there for Wells Fargo.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And then lastly just on mortgage. John you mentioned at the beginning a lot of the headwinds that are sitting in front of us in mortgage, one of the questions we get often is what about the credit box? And is there an opportunity here as home prices improve and as consumer balance sheets improve that there is some losing of standards on the credit box; maybe you could speak to that?", "John Stumpf", "Well I would say, I don\u2019t know that\u2019s valued so much. I think the bigger part of the credit box right now to open up would be a better understanding of repurchase risk. And we\u2019re doing a lot of work with folks and the government about that issue. I think that influenced it more than value of homes. Although values are important, but because your credit overlays today are not related to values, they\u2019re related to in many cases repurchase risks.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Right. And apparently the FHFA is working on crystallizing that more clearly for people I assume it\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, exactly. There has to be, I think it\u2019s helpful to America to American homeowners, perspective homeowners to the agencies and to originators that there is a understanding of when risk transfers. Now, if the originator does a poor job and doesn\u2019t underwrite properly, surly they should be held accountable. But if a default happens later and due to a technical issue unrelated to the payment ability of the customer that could have been known then risk should transfer. And whenever that period of time is, I think that would be helpful. And there are a number of Americans who want to buy home, can afford to buy home, who simply can get credit.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "So do you think you, if you had certain amount of clarity like two plus three years risk transfers assuming we did a good job as an underwriter, would that have a material impact on how you are putting on your credit overlays?", "John Stumpf", "Well, it would surely change. It would really the change the way we look at overlays. And I\u2019m not saying it is, could have changes to market, but those every home that gets sold that satisfies a customers need not only fulfills a dream, but a dollar spent on a home multiply through the economy like no other thing that we do, I mean a loan to a small business, we love it, do a lot, but a loan to homeowner is magical in that respect. So every time we can serve another customer, good things happen.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Hi, can you hear me?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, hi Mike. Good morning.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Hey, John, do you still dream about checking account? And the reason I asked -- or do you dream about them as much, because with the ten year where it is, I mean do you still go all gung ho, get as much deposits as you can get to the long-term value or do you somehow need to balance that with the need for shorter term profitability?", "John Stumpf", "In fact Mike I\u2019m going to bed earlier these days, so I can even dream longer about them. I still just love checking, and here is why. But it\u2019s a good question, it\u2019s a serious question.", "First of all, when an account comes like we grew net primary checking accounts 4.9% on the consumer side and 5.6% on the business side, they don\u2019t come alone, they come with a relationship. And the increases you are seeing and debit card activity and credit card, we almost have 40% of our customers now carry our credit card that was 22% in 2009, and they do other things with us. And secondly, you know how expensive it is to bill liquidity for the LCR and other things; deposits are hugely important in that. So, now the love affair has not ended and we won\u2019t be in this environment forever. But if we can serve customers for a long time that feels like even we\u2019d love that.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Well you mentioned that you are trying to mitigate the impact somewhat with expenses and you are actually increasing your number of branches but I guess you are reducing the square feet. Can you give us some sense of what sort of square foot reduction you are looking for in your bank branches say over 5 or even 10 years?", "John Stumpf", "I\u2019ll give you -- let me give you kind of a high level and then I\u2019ll try to answer your question specifically. When we -- if you go back five, six years, we had about 116 million or 117 million square feet and that was not only for our stores but for all of our people; today that\u2019s in the 93 million, 94 million square foot range. We still think we have quite ways to go. We have 6,200 banking stores and we have another couple of thousand other advisor and mortgage stores but let\u2019s just talk about the banking stores for a second.", "We try to refresh 500, 600 of those every year plus we are -- we\u2019re at pretty steady state right now. We\u2019re in that 6,200; we will replace two with the new one and relocate it. When we do refresh them, we will reduce in many case square footage or increase the density in the stores. I think you and I\u2019ve actually had discussions about which is now a three stores in the Washington area where these are, I wouldn\u2019t say stores of the future in terms of replace all of our 6,200 stores but they fit into the model where they are 1,000 to 1,200 square feet; during the day time it\u2019s a full functioning store, night time the walls folding, it\u2019s ATM best field 7X24; and so all of that matters in the mix. And the reason we are doing that is that we have found stores are still critically important to the overall distribution community and convenience we provide customers.", "So we will continue to march in this way; it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to replace every store, sometimes we are even adding space because it\u2019s kind of a hub and spoke. So, it\u2019s really a collage of store designs and activities that all fit into this. But you\u2019re right with the idea of reducing overhead, reducing space we\u2019re providing the convenience customers want.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "So over the last five years you reduced square feet by about one-fifth, over the next five years how much do you think you can reduce it by?", "John Shrewsberry", "I don\u2019t know that we have absolute goal, but it will continue to go down. There are lots of opportunities and that\u2019s going to be critical.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "And just one separate question, you had a comment in the American Bank I think it was and you alluded to it today that it\u2019s tougher for some individuals to get mortgage loans from Wells Fargo because of the risk of repurchase. And so is this simply, would you describe it as an unintended consequence of some of the regulatory actions over the past few years?", "John Shrewsberry", "I would say it\u2019s unintended consequence of activity, I don\u2019t know but so much on the regulation side, but it sure is. It can give us a cause to pause and other originators, we\u2019re not unique in this. What you have repurchase request that go back 8 and 10 years and in many cases are things unrelated to the credit quality or the credit payment ability of the borrower at the time of the borrowing. We\u2019ve put open ways on. Now we start to reduce a little of those if we start to understand more about repurchase, but it\u2019s just, it is an unintended consequence. I don\u2019t if it\u2019s so much regulation as it is the activities of the GSEs.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "So is this a permanent dampening for the mortgage market?", "John Shrewsberry", "No, I actually think that we\u2019re going to -- I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019re going to figure this out. We\u2019re working with actually too many groups who are saying to us, this isn\u2019t working for us. And we\u2019re working with other originators, we\u2019re working with the Mortgage Bankers\u2019 Association, we\u2019re working with the head of the FHFA, we\u2019re working with the GSEs, we\u2019re working with government agencies the Fed and others because we need to figure this out.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Alright. Thanks a lot.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities", "Thanks. Good morning. You guys mentioned in response to an earlier question that we\u2019re not going to be in this environment forever. Following up on that thought, I was hoping you could share your deposit growth outlook just from a high level with QE now coming to an end. Would you expect to see a slowdown and overall industry deposit growth and the corresponding excess liquidity building? And if so, does that mean that some of the excess liquidity driven NIM compression that we\u2019ve been seeing should abate?", "John Shrewsberry", "Let me take a shot at that. Clearly money supply and what\u2019s happening there has influence. But I can tell you our household growth; I think John mentioned in his numbers, August is the strongest we\u2019ve seen in years. And because of where our store distribution and the geography of it, we happen to be in higher growth states. We happen to get a disproportionate growth of millennials and in emerging communities.", "So I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen at the top of the house with M1 or M2 I\u2019d would like that, but I\u2019m confident about the way we run our retail franchise and the work we\u2019re doing at wealth brokerage retirement. And frankly on the corporate side in winning new customers and growing not only existing accounts, but growing new accounts. And frankly that\u2019s one of the reason stores are important. Our strongest growth is in areas where we have the best distribution of a store network not that it\u2019s the only part of the distribution, but it\u2019s a critical part for acquisition.", "John Stumpf", "One thing that I would add to that is that our deposits are disproportionately core deposits, operational deposits, relationship types of deposits and less so institutional deposits from people who are probably more inclined to immediately shipped out as Fed does whatever they\u2019re going to do to drain reserves in the system and to tighten monitory policy if that ever happen.", "And as a result, we feel like we\u2019ve got a stickier deposit base. And all things being equal, if we were, it was a question of loosing deposits versus retaining them, we obviously have the ability to price our deposits to compete with whatever the alternative investment opportunity or savings opportunity is for our customers because we\u2019re sitting here with a full service capability and lots of levers in the relationships that we have.", "So unlike some firms that probably have a higher percentage of institutional deposits that are seeking the last basis point of yield, I don\u2019t think, I think we compare favorably in terms of deposits stickiness.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities", "Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. I had a second question on the rate environment, assuming that we do start to see the Fed funds rate increase next year. How are you thinking about the potential for an environment where the Feds taking retire at the short end of the curve, but demand for treasuries remain strong at the long end since then we end up with the flatter curve. How are you guys positioned to perform in that kind of environment?", "John Stumpf", "That would actually be not that outcome at all because we would have less capital pressure on loan rates backing up on our bond portfolio and we\u2019d be benefiting as loans and other LIBOR linked assets re-price on at the short-end. So, at least with respect to those two drivers of accounting outcomes, those would be favorable.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities", "Excellent. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.", "Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Good morning, guys.", "John Stumpf", "Hey, Scott.", "Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "I was just hoping you could spend just a moment or two talking about the operating losses, just given the trajectory, they were up kind of substantially in the second quarter and then up another bit again; I mean I can imagine given some of the conversations we\u2019ve had on regulatory issues, so what might be driving that. But can you spend a second maybe discussing when or how or even why those might crest and then hopefully begin to ebb back down?", "John Stumpf", "Well, we\u2019ve mentioned that this month\u2019s elevated -- this quarter\u2019s elevated level reflects primarily litigation accruals and as a result, there is not much more specific color we can offer except to point you to our crystal clear disclosure in our Qs and K that describe everything that\u2019s probable and estimable and then sum. And it\u2019s like anything else; it\u2019s hard to know whether you\u2019re cresting or not until you\u2019re on the other side of it. So we feel this is a somewhat higher level than it\u2019s been recently and we think it\u2019s well disclosed.", "Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Okay. All right, sounds good. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks", "Thank you. I wanted to talk about two different lines of questioning more long-term in nature. One is that as you\u2019re pulling your short-term assets higher by about $25 billion each quarter and you mentioned that in the terms of liquidity but is also adding about 2% to your asset sensitivity every quarter. So it just seems like you\u2019re looking at the level of opportunities that you have in deciding to forego the yields of today and a hope for better yields tomorrow increasing asset sensitivity. So John, I just want to get your feel for how you\u2019re kind of managing that decision you mentioned several times.", "", "John Stumpf", "Well, it\u2019s a complex decision; it involves our asset and liability and a lot of discussion among management from time to time. And the items that you just mentioned tend to be a little bit backward looking because you don\u2019t know what a quarter\u2019s loan growth is until it\u2019s happened. Floating rate loan growth contributes to asset sensitivity.", "The governing factors probably what our capital sensitivity is to a back up in rates if we deploy into duration instruments and out of cash equivalents. And getting that right is important, so that we don\u2019t find ourselves with higher rates that we\u2019ve all always been waiting for and a higher level of economic activity which would probably mean more non-interest income generation and more loan growth, a lot of exciting activity and at the same time be damaging our capital to the point that we couldn\u2019t take full advantage of it. And so that is one of those marginal drivers that probably caused us to be a little bit more in cash, a little bit more asset sensitive than -- versus being more fully invested today.", "", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks", "But at least looking back, funding sources of long term debt and sticky deposits growth with growth in short term liquid assets naturally I guess I just want to make sure we\u2019re both agreeing that that makes you more asset sensitive each quarter.", "", "John Shrewsberry", "That makes us more asset-sensitive. That\u2019s right.", "", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks", "And then just real quickly, other line of thinking was John, how have you increased the growth in households and businesses? I mean moving that number up a 4 percentage point on the consumer side and 2, 4 percentage points on the business side long-term is a big driver. How do you see the source of those and is that sustainable at these higher levels?", "John Stumpf", "Well, it\u2019s hard to know whether it\u2019s sustainable because again that\u2019s forward-looking. The reason that it\u2019s happening is a result of the quality of our people, the quality of our products, the execution of our business model and just consistent application of the value proposition that we\u2019re bringing. And it\u2019s paying dividends like we thought that it would, hope that it would. If work goes in the future as a function of variety of inputs that are hard to know, but we like our competitive standing and so to the extent that we\u2019re growing faster than our large and regional bank competition, we\u2019re not surprised by and that\u2019s what we expect.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks", "And would you see that in the traditional markets or more in you\u2019ve got the Wachovia markets and the franchise not pulled together. So you\u2019re really getting traction and being able to attract new customers now you got all that processed?", "John Shrewsberry", "I think they are all traditional markets now.", "John Stumpf", "Yes, exactly. We don\u2019t think\u2026", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks", "Understand, I don\u2019t know if incrementally you\u2019re getting some new households in those newer let\u2019s say market?", "John Stumpf", "We\u2019re getting it in all of our markets.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks", "Alright, thanks.", "John Shrewsberry", "They\u2019re all good to us.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks", "I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "Good morning, guys. How are you?", "John Stumpf", "", "Hi Nancy.", "John Shrewsberry", "Good morning.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "This is sort of an overarching question John and John that goes to a lot of the stuff we\u2019re hearing not only on your call, but on the JP Morgan Chase call about these sort of continuing calls for increased capital all these other new requirements that are being put on the industry to which there is seemingly no end. And there is -- I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read this in the press as well, this beginning characterization of the banking industry as the new electric utility. Are the regulators trying to enforce so much conformity on the industry that they are going to do away with the dynamism and the willingness of the banking industry? John could you just give us, either John, just give us some perspective on that and where you think that indeed is happening?", "John Stumpf", "Well, there is no question that they can stay. The regulatory, the global regulatory community keeps apparently keeps adding on to both capital and liquidity requirements that are going to have the combined effect of changing business models, increasing operating costs or financing costs and then applying that to an increased denominator of equity in the ROE calculation. To an industry that broadly speaking other than Wells Fargo and perhaps some regional banks has not been over achieving in returns over the last couple of years.", "So, if you roll the tape forward, I assume that that gets mathematically worse before it gets betters unless a higher rate environment, a higher growth environment a real optimization on the part of the most impact banks in terms of changing their business model allows them to perform at a higher level. So, I think it is, it\u2019s a consequence of what you\u2019re describing, it is happening and we can\u2019t talk or anybody else is going to deal with it. But we\u2019ve, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re proud to have to continue to generate a top of the peer group type of returns in spite of the amount of capital that we\u2019re carrying and the ample liquidity that we\u2019re carrying too.", "John Shrewsberry", "Nancy it\u2019s an interesting question and there is no question that there has been increases, some of them are settled and different issues be combining constraints and different ways. Of our business, 97% of our revenues come from the U.S. We love our international business, but we\u2019re dominant -- our dominant part of our business is here that makes it a bit easier for us and the challenge and I think the opportunity for leadership is to make sure that we do both we meet or exceed the requirements on the capital liquidity and those side and also we continue to invest in things that attract team members to us, attract customers to us, be dynamic in the marketplace differentiating. And we\u2019re so embedded in the real economy that the things we\u2019re doing continue to allow us to grow that business. So, we can never predict the future, but that\u2019s a challenge for us as leaders to do both.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "John, do you see yourself, John Stumpf, do you see yourself as having to change your plans for growth either businesses that you would like to be in? Do you see that you might have to divest any of your present businesses? Should this sort of regulatory minds that continue and intensify?", "John Stumpf", "At this point in time the answer is no, because again virtually everything we do here starts with a customer. And we look at relationship value and pricing and different businesses have different returns and so forth. And we\u2019re always thinking about adjusting like few -- last quarter we sold smaller insurance offices, doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t like interest business, we just -- but there is always things that are going on. But there is nothing in anything I see today that would say I can\u2019t be in this business or we can\u2019t be in that business; it relates to customers.", "", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC", "Okay, all right. Thank you.", "", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Please go ahead.", "", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point", "Good morning.", "", "John Stumpf", "Good morning. ", "", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point", "I noticed that you had quite a bit of increasing construction loans quarter-over-quarter and they\u2019re basically staying flat for several years. Is there something in particular that\u2019s causing the development and expansion of construction loans or is that something that you\u2019re looking at like an initiative going forward?", "", "John Stumpf", "We\u2019re the largest commercial real estate lender in the country. And as I\u2019ve said in some place recently, you fly around; go in any city looks like a crane convention going on. I mean there is a lot of commercial activity going on and we serve that community and that sector of the economy. There is also housing is better than it has been in the past. So I think it reflects more the natural activity happening in the marketplace as opposed to us changing our strategy somehow.", "", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point", "Alright. And then in regards to student loan business, are you still planning on selling the thought portfolio by year end or can you talk about the overall investor appetite for these loans? And then separately on the private side, I know this is a peak lending quarter for student loans but could you provide any color around the demand trend from students given the overall level of student out there?", "John Stumpf", "Well, with respect to the first part of your question, we still do intend to sell those loans, can\u2019t really comment on the specific to sales moving forward, progressing as expected. And what I can tell you is like any other fixed income asset category in this highly liquid environment there is plenty of interest. But in terms of whether it happens in the fourth quarter or later, I don\u2019t want to be too specific.", "We remain very committed to private student lending and of course our student lending team now will be even more focused on our private business once we\u2019ve sold the self loans. And with respect to whether demand after accounting for seasonality as you mentioned has changed or not changed. We are in a point in time when a very high number of people are already student borrowers and but it\u2019s still one of the three or four most important things that are customers do, they buy a home, they buy a car, they finance their education and they save for retirement and we expect that to continue.", "Kevin Barker - Compass Point", "Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.", "John Stumpf", "Okay. I think we\u2019re done with the call now. I want to first of all thank all of you for jointing us and thank our 265,000 team members across our company for an outstanding quarter. If you look at the drivers of long-term growth, loans, deposits, the capital, the liquidity we have, the household growth, it sure makes us optimistic about the future. We operate within our ROA, ROE and efficiency ratio targets that we had provided a couple of years ago. And we\u2019re really proud that we return more capital to you our owners. So we\u2019re well positioned for the future and we\u2019ll see you in 90 days. Thank you very much everyone.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

We generated record earnings, produced strong deposit and loan growth, grew the number of customers we serve, improved credit quality, enhanced our strong risk management practices, strengthened our capital and liquidity levels and rewarded our shareholders by increasing our dividend and buying back more shares.", "Our achievements during 2014 demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model and our continued focus on the real economy. Let me share just some of our accomplishments during the past year.", "We generated earnings of $23 billion and earnings per share of $4.10, both up 5% from the prior year. We grew both revenue and pretax, pre-provision profit. We had strong broad-based loan growth. Our core loan portfolio increased by $60 billion or 8%.", "Our deposit franchise continue to generate strong consumer and balanced growth with total deposit up $89 billion or 8% and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.2%.", "Our credit performance continue to be very strong with net charge-off down $1.6 billion and our net charge-off ratio declining to just 35 basis points for the year.", "Our capital levels increased even as we returned more capital to shareholders. We returned $12.5 billion to our stockholders through dividends and net share repurchases, up 74% from a year ago.", "While we serve our customers throughout the world, 97% of our revenue comes from the United States and there had been many signs of strength in the U.S. economy. GDP growth accelerated during 2014 and may be even stronger in 2015.", "Last year was the strongest year of job growth in 15 years and December was the 50th consecutive month of job creation, unprecedented in U.S. history.", "Consumer confidence is at its highest level since the peak of the last economic expansion. Home ownership remains an aspiration for most Americans and recent development such as the announced reduction in FHA premiums, GSE clarification on repurchase rules and changes in GSE lending guidelines should provide some benefit to the housing market where affordability remains attractive.", "While lower oil prices have created volatility in the financial markets, America as a whole is a net consumer of energy and American households will benefit from the decline in energy prices, which is positive for the U.S. economy.", "I believe the improvement in the economy, the strength of our balance sheet, the diversity of our businesses and the continued commitment of our team members to meet our customer's financial needs will provide Wells Fargo with many opportunities in the year ahead.", "John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer will now provide more details on our fourth quarter results. John?", "John Shrewsberry", "Thanks John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplements starting on Page two. John and I will then answer your questions.", "Wells Fargo had another strong quarter, earning $5.7 billion and $1.02 in EPS in the fourth quarter. Our results included continued strong loan and deposit growth that was diversified across our businesses and credit quality continued to reflect the benefit of our ongoing risk discipline.", "Our capital levels remained strong even as we returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.", "Slide three highlights our strong full year results that John discussed at the beginning of the call, including increased revenue and pretax, pre-provision profit, strong loan and deposit growth, higher earnings and increasing our net payout ratio to 57%.", "Page four highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income in the fourth quarter. The benefit of our diversified business model is that we have over 90 businesses that performed differently based on interest rates in the economic environment.", "While the balance between spread and fee income has remained consistent over time, the drivers of fee income have varied. For example over the past five years, mortgage banking as a share of total fee income has been its highest 28%, but because of the decline in mortgage refinancing activity, mortgage banking fees have declined as expected and represented 15% of fee income in the fourth quarter.", "However other businesses have benefitted from current market conditions, our trust in investment fees have steadily increased over the past five years and we're 36% of fee income in the fourth quarter.", "These examples demonstrate the benefit of our diversification and how our business mix enables us to focus on meeting our customer's financial needs, while retaining our risk discipline.", "Let me highlight some key drivers of our fourth quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective starting on Page five. I'll discuss the drivers of our strong loan and deposit growth later in the call.", "Short-term investments in fed funds sold declined $3.5 billion from the third quarter due to the deployment of liquidity into loans and investment securities. This was the first time since the fourth quarter of 2011 that we've had a linked quarter decline.", "Investment securities increased $24 billion from the third quarter, due to $35 billion of purchases partially offset by run-off and maturities. The majority of our purchases were U.S. treasury and federal agency securities.", "Turning to the income statement on Page six, revenue grew $230 million during the quarter with growth in net interest income and stable non-interest income.", "Expenses increased in the quarter reflecting higher personnel cost, continued investments in our businesses and risk related initiatives and some typically higher fourth quarter expenses. Our results in the quarter also reflected lower income tax expense, which was down $123 million.", "As shown on Page seven, we continue to have strong broad-based loan growth in the fourth quarter, our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The core loan portfolio grew by $60.4 billion, or 8% from a year ago, and was up $26 billion or 13% annualized from the third quarter.", "Loan growth in the fourth quarter included $6.5 billion from financing related to the sale of our government guaranteed student loans as well as the Dillard\u2019s credit card portfolio acquisition.", "Our liquidating portfolio decreased $20.1 billion from a year ago.

Auto loans were up $4.9 billion or 10% from last year. While we continued to benefit from the strong auto market, new originations were down from a year ago, reflecting our continued risk and pricing discipline in a competitive market.", "Credit card balances were up $4.2 million or 16% from a year ago, benefiting from a combination of organic account and loan growth as well as the benefit of the Dillard's portfolio acquisition.", "Slide Nine demonstrates the diversity of businesses that contributed to the growth in C&I loans. Let me highlight just a few. Asset-backed finance increased $16.7 billion, which included $6.5 billion from financing related to a government guaranteed student loan sale.", "Corporate banking grew $5.8 billion, driven by new customer growth and higher utilization rates from existing customers. And capital finance grew $3.8 billion reflecting new customer growth.", "As you can see on Page 10, we had over $1.1 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $22.7 billion or 8% annualized from the third quarter. Our average deposit cost declined one basis point to nine basis points in the fourth quarter.", "Our strong growth in checking customers continued in the fourth quarter with primary consumer checking customers growing 5.2% from a year ago and primary small business and business banking checking customers increasing 5.4%.", "Our success reflected the advantages Wells Fargo offers including broad based and industry-leading distribution channels, enhanced product offerings that make it easier for customers to do more business with us and improved customer retention.", "We continue to grow net interest income on a tax equivalent basis, up $255 million from the third quarter, reflecting strong growth in average earning assets up $43.5 billion or 3%.", "The net interest margin, declined two basis point from the third quarter due to strong deposit growth, which resulted in higher average balances of cash and short term investments and from actions we took in the third quarter, which resulted in higher average balances and liquidity-related funding.", "The impact of all other balance sheet growth and reprising benefit in the margin by three basis point due to a larger investment portfolio and stronger loan originations, increased interest income from variable sources benefited the margin by one basis point.", "Our balance sheet remains asset sensitive, so we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from higher rates, but as we\u2019ve demonstrated by growing net interest income throughout the year, we're not relying on rates to increase to generate growth. Of course the first quarter will be impacted by two fewer days in the quarter. ", "Total non-interest income was stable from third quarter as higher trust and investment fees, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage commissions and a $217 million gain on the sale of government guaranteed student loans was offset by a $396 million decline in market sensitive revenue, driven by lower equity gains and lower mortgage banking revenue and deposit service charges.", "The decline in deposit service charges in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower overdraft related fess resulting from changes we implemented in early October designed to provide customers with more real-time information to manage their deposit accounts and avoid overdrafts.", "Mortgage banking revenue declined $118 million from the third quarter. As expected, mortgage origination income was down from the last quarter reflecting reduced volume from the seasonally lower purchase market.", "The decline in mortgage rates during the quarter resulted in refinancing volume increasing to 40% of originations up from 30% last quarter.", "While it's still early, the continued declining rates could benefit origination volumes from the first quarter and we currently expect volumes to be relatively consistent with fourth quarter levels, despite the fact that the first quarter usually reflects its lower purchase market.", "Our gain on sale margin was consistent with last quarter and is expected to remain within the range we\u2019ve seen over the past four quarters.", "Servicing income increased modestly from third quarter reflecting lower unreimbursed direct servicing cost, partially offset by lower net head results.", "Our total trust and investment fees were up $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter which was a record high and increased to $151 million from third quarter driven by higher investment banking activity.", "Our expenses continue to reflect our investments in our businesses including risk related initiatives. ", "As shown on Page 13, expenses were up $399 million from third quarter. There were a number of factors driving this increase.", "Personal expenses increase $272 million reflecting higher deferred comp expense, which is offsetting revenue, higher revenue based incentive compensation and higher healthcare costs.", "A number of our expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. Equipment expense was up $124 million, primarily due to annual software license renewals.", "Outside professional services increased $116 million, which included higher project related spending on business investments as well as risk related initiatives. Advertising expenses were also elevated up $42 million from third quarter.", "While these typically higher expenses should be lower next quarter we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense.", "Our expenses will also reflect our continued investments in our infrastructure -- our risk infrastructure, including hiring new team members and ongoing project spending.", "Our efficiency ratio is 58.1% for full year 2014 and we expect the efficiency ratio for full year 2015 to remain within our target range of 55% to 59%even if the upper end of our target range we're operating more efficiently than many of our peers.", "Turning to our business segments starting on Page 14, community banking earned $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 7% from a year ago and down 1% from the third quarter.", "I've already highlighted the strong growth in primary checking customers. We've also been successfully adding retail bank households.", "Through November our year-to-date household growth rate was the highest since 2010. Meeting the financial needs of these new households will help drive growth across our diversified product line.", "Our debit and credit card businesses are examples of where we've had success and yet still have opportunities for continued growth.", "Debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago driven by primary checking customer growth and increased usage from our existing customers. Our credit card penetration rate increased to 42%, up from 37% a year ago.", "Credit card purchase volume grew 17% from a year ago reflecting account growth and increased usage among our existing customers.", "Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the fourth quarter, down 7% from a year ago and up 3% from the third quarter. Loan growth continued to be strong with average loans up $32.2 billion or 11% from a year ago with growth across many businesses as I highlighted earlier.", "Credit quality remained outstanding with eight consecutive quarters of net recoveries. Deposit growth was also strong with average core deposits up $33.9 billion or 13% from a year ago.", "Results also benefited from strong investments banking fees, up 10% from a year ago, driven by higher loan syndication fees, high yield debt origination fees and equity underwriting.", "Treasury management revenue increased 11% from a year ago, benefiting from record product sales in 2014 and re-pricing. Wealth, brokerage and retirement earned $514 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from a year ago and down at 7% from the third quarter.", "Revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. The growth in fee income was driven by a 12% increase in asset-based fees as we continue to execute on our strategic initiative of focusing on plan-based relationships resulting in higher recurring revenue.", "Our brokerage advisory assets grew to $423 billion, up $48 million dollars or 13% from a year ago, primarily due to positive net flows. Loan growth for WBR remained strong, up 13% from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth.", "This growth was primarily driven by an increase in high quality, non-confirming mortgage loans.", "Turning to Page 17, credit quality in the fourth quarter remained strong with a net charge-off ratio of 34 basis points of average loans. The $67 million increase in net charge-offs from the third quarter was primarily driven by lower recoveries down $54 million, which we would expect at this stage with the credit cycle.", "Nonperforming assets have declined for nine consecutive quarters and were down $739 million from the third quarter. Nonaccrual loans declined $517 million and foreclosed assets declined to $222 million.", "The reserve release was $250 million in the fourth quarter, down $50 million from third quarter and down $350 million from a year ago.", "Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach full phased on at 10.44% in the fourth quarter. Our ratio declined slightly from the third quarter, reflecting an increase in the risk weighted assets, primarily from strong loan growth in the quarter.", "We stated that our long term target is 10%, which includes a buffer over required minimums. Since we've achieved our targeted level, our capital ratios may fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting changes in asset levels or composition or changes in OCI impacted by market volatility. These potential changes are why we maintain a buffer.", "As shown on Slide 19, we returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter. Our common shares outstanding declined by 45 million shares in the fourth quarter, reflecting 62 million shares purchased during the quarter.", "In addition we entered into a $750 million forward repurchase contracts that's expected to settle in the first quarter for approximately 14 million shares. As a reminder, our share issuance is usually higher in the first half of the year, given the timing of certain employee benefit plan issuances.", "So in summary, our results in 2014 and for the fourth quarter reflected the benefit of our diversified business model, with strong growth in loans and deposits. Our loan portfolio is well diversified and charge-offs were near historic lows. We increased the amount of our capital and liquidity and returned $12.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.", "Our net payout ratio was 57% for the year within our targeted range of 55% to 75%. We believe we're well positioned to benefit from an improving economy and increased customer base. Our diverse product line and our continued risk discipline.", "Our diversified business model has performed well across a variety of economic and interest rate environments and I am optimistic that it will continue to produce opportunities for our customers, our team members and our shareholders in the year ahead.", "We'll now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Morford of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joe Morford", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "John Stumpf", "Hey morning.", "Joe Morford", "I just wondered if you could speak to how we should think about weighing the positive and negative effects of the sharp drop in energy prices on the bank, while it should help out the consumer businesses, is it enough to offset any potential credit issues or probably slow down in loan growth and investment banking activity?", "John Stumpf", "Well as I mentioned in my comments Joe, since the United States is a net consumer, net importer of oil, we think it's a positive for the U.S. economy. Clearly that's on average because there is going to be some states that are impacted. Some customers who are going to be impacted and some businesses that's going to be impacted, but we serve 70 million customers.", "Virtually all of them know how to fill the gas tank and go to a gas pump and that's a real benefit. So we think net, net it's an opportunity. Surely there are offsets like we said, but even within the oil and gas business and John mentioned we are participant there. It's about 2% of our loans.", "There is still a lot of opportunity for consolidation there and we'll participate in that with our customers. We're looking at our portfolio. We analyze that. We've been through that over the past, but net, net, we think it's a positive.", "Joe Morford", "Okay. Great, I guess somewhat related to that with the teams recently, the expectation is now that higher rates are getting pushed out. We could be lower for longer, which theoretically could weigh on margins.", "Do you expect to be able to offset that with better growth in the business amidst the stronger economies you talk about or do you see any need to take a harder look at expenses and what other levers might you have to pull there?", "John Shrewsberry", "We're always taking a hard look at expenses. So there is nothing incremental that we would plan on doing there, but continuing to be as vigilant as we have.", "We've been operating at a pretty strong level in a zero interest rate environment for a very long time and while because of the way our balance sheet is positioned, it would probably be -- there is upside when short term rates move and if that happen later, then that upside might be realized later.", "We're continuing to position ourselves to compete and to perform in this interest rate environment and so loan growth, deposit growth, redeploying excess liquidity into earning assets, as I said being vigilant on expense, all of those things contribute to the performance that we've had and that we're anticipating continuing to have until that time that rates begin to move.", "Joe Morford", "Okay. Thanks so much for the thoughts.", "John Stumpf", "Thanks Joe.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "John McDonald", "Hi. Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Hi John.", "John McDonald", "I was wondering John on just a question on credit and provision asset quality clearly remains excellent and I wasn\u2019t sure if you mentioned future reserve releases John, but with such strong loan growth and credit metrics now looking stable, should we expect the reserve releases to taper off and might you need to start adding to reserves at some point if loan growth continues at this kind of pace?", "John Shrewsberry", "I think the short answer is yes. if we have robust loan growth going forward all things being equal even, that would contribute to the need for some amount of incremental provisioning. So it's going to be a function of the amount of loan growth, the mix of loan growth, the quality of the portfolio overall and general economic conditions.", "One thing I would add to Joe's first question also is there is no specific provisioning action in the fourth quarter for what's going on in the energy world. There is nothing anticipated, nothing necessary at the moment, but there is nothing in that quarter either.", "John McDonald", "Okay. Did you make a comment about reserve releases John and if you achieved kind of -- in the past couple of quarters, you said reserve releases could continue. I was wondering if that changed a little bit now with credit bottoming in if I missed out.", "John Shrewsberry", "With the size of the portfolio, the size of the allowance and the amount of the fourth quarter's release, the $250 million, it's close to call. We've said in the recent past to expect them to taper.", "Now for the reasons that you mentioned and I described, there could be future releases -- there could be future net provisioning. So we're at that point in the cycle I think.", "John McDonald", "Okay. Got it and then in terms of just the net interest income, the puts and takes, did you say how big the Dillard\u2019s portfolio was or could you tell us?", "John Shrewsberry", "We can't because of the nature of the contract we have with our customers. You can see the amount of loan growth in the credit card portfolio from quarter to quarter and that's a combination of the organic growth in the Dillard\u2019s portfolio.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And then any clarity you can offer on what opened up in terms of opportunity to deploy the liquidity this quarter, anything driving that in particular?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, some clarity around our liquidity framework, clarity around -- further clarity around LCR, further clarity on what kind of cash versus other HQLA we would need to have. I think that emboldened us a little bit in terms of finding an entry point, but as we've said, these are difficult times for finding attractive entry points into fixed income markets when we're thinking about making that switch.", "John Stumpf", "And John also we had as you know continued very strong deposit growth.", "John McDonald", "Got it. Okay. Great. And just one last quick thing on TLAC John, rules on finalized, we do have a proposal, how do you feel on that and would you have to do some gradual preparing for that as we go forward?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure, well just depending on where the ultimate rule comes out versus the range that's been published, at the low end of the range we've got less to do and at the high end of the range we would have more to do.", "There is still a lot to know and there is some wood to chop in the regulatory realm to get to the final rule where on the record is pointing out that we really don't -- the industry doesn\u2019t understand the need for the magnitude of the total buffer that's been to our loss absorbing capacity that's been talked about here.", "We certainly find that it lands a little bit harder on people who seem to have less risky business models. Those of us who are deposit funded with a little bit more straightforward deposit taking and lending type of activity.", "We would like some clarity on why that makes sense, but however it lands, within the range that's been published, the approach for Wells Fargo is going to be to add more termed at the holding company level and that will have a -- that will have a P&L consequence that we have to navigate through and it will be substantially more manageable at the lower end of the range and somewhat more expensive at the higher end of the range.", "John McDonald", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Erika Najarian", "Yes. Good morning. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning.", "Erika Najarian", "I appreciate the color that you have given us so far on what you expect from mortgage originations in the first quarter, but as we think about the full year and think about your comments earlier, high consumer confidence, accelerating GDP in the context of potentially lower long rate for longer.", "Is it possible that from an industry level, the origination growth for this year could surpass the current MBA forecast of 6%.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. The numbers last time that I've seen from them is $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion. Yes, it could be higher based on those things. As I mentioned in my comments with what was done recently in FHA and some of the things that the GSEs are doing and if rates stay low or are favorable, surely we could see more activity and you could see actually more activity on both the refinance side and the purchased-money side.", "We'll just have to see how that goes, but -- and I don't think there has been any reduction or any update on those numbers from the MBA, but it could the higher end of that range.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. And on the flip side to that, you mentioned that you did get more clarity on also your HQLA with regards to being more aggressive on liquidity deployment, but John, you've mentioned several times that absolute level of rates have dictated your cash deployment or liquidity deployment strategy.", "As we look at into 2015, was the clarity around the rules enough to make you a little bit more aggressive about deploying your liquidity into earning assets or is it going to continue to be largely rate dependent?", "John Shrewsberry", "Oh, it's a good question. It's substantially rate dependent at this point and loan growth dependent as well because that's the first call in all of our available liquidity is making loans to customers.", "But if we believe that we're in a lower for longer, long term rate scenario separate that from policy rates for a moment, but just thinking about the tenure and mortgage rates etcetera, at the margin that probably emboldens us a little bit additionally to convert what's cash today into duration over the course of the year.", "And actually we still have tens of billions available. So there's just a lot of liquidity on the sheet.", "Erika Najarian", "Understood and just a quick follow-up, we appreciate the color that you gave in terms of the impact of energy, as there have been a lot of questions from investors in terms of what it would take for banks to adjust its qualitative reserve to reflect lower energy prices?", "I was just wondering if that's how Wells Fargo does it or do you really look at the reserve at least in terms of your energy and commercial exposure on a name by name, loan by loan basis?", "John Shrewsberry", "So in the case of commercial and corporate loans, it's absolutely that some of the parts have a name by name basis and the risk rating on each loan. We have hundreds of customers in the energy business. They are in the E&P or upstream part of the market.", "There are midstream companies. There are services companies. We have the largest team in this area, very long tenure. Have been through several cycles and we're working with -- we're building customer by customer and working through each situation to figure out what this job means to them based on their leverage, based on their hedging profile, based on their assets, based on their management capability and that will lead to risk rating changes on a loan by loan basis or a name by name basis as time unfold and it's that activity that would lead to changes in our reserving posture for the portfolio.", "John Stumpf", "And we don't want to minimize this, but this is nature of that business. If you go back just six years, we've had $30 a barrel oil and we've had $140 a barrel oil. We've seen gas for example, natural gas go from $6, $7 Mcf to $2 and some change today and that's just part of that business.", "John Shrewsberry", "On the E&P side of that portfolio, those tend to be reserve based loans, asset based loans with a very interactive approach between the bank and the borrower in terms of determining the value of the collateral and then re-margining the loan down to reflect changes in the value of the collateral and of course that's at our discretion. We have our own engineers and we're very engaged in that process.", "So all of that -- all of that ties into what the future reserving needs requirements are for that portfolio and as I said, nothing obviously has revealed itself yet and there is nothing in the fourth quarter specifically for that.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure.", "Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Ken Usdin", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "John Stumpf", "Hi Ken.", "Ken Usdin", "A couple of questions on the fee side, John you had mentioned some of the tweaks you made in October on the service charges side, so I am wondering if you can help us understand what types of changes those were?", "And then how you're looking at your product set with regards to either payday advance and whatever pending rules we could still get at some point next year on overdrafts and if that would continue to have an impact on your deposit fees?", "John Shrewsberry", "So what happened in October wasn\u2019t a change in the product or what we charged for and rather we un-ruled some incremental technology that allows our customers to have more real time information to manage their own baking affairs and they've been using that information and successfully reducing the amount of over-drafting method and which had an impact on our revenue.", "We think it's very customer friendly and it's good for all of us. That's distinct from any pricing approach or a product approach that we'll have. With respect to -- go ahead.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. No go ahead.", "John Shrewsberry", "You asked about short term or payday type lending, I think it's clear that during 2014 we discontinued a product that we used to offer that was a direct deposit advance product that allowed people to borrow on a short term unsecured basis with their next direct deposit pay check as security for a source of repayment for the loan and there was some regulatory urging around that.", "I think most of the discussion around those types of products is now frankly outside the banking system because it's private financed companies who are providing that and that's how it seems to be doing that with from a regulatory perspective.", "I would also tell you that the discontinued product is out of the run rate at this point. So the impact has been fully realized.", "Ken Usdin", "And then overdrafts?", "John Shrewsberry", "Hard to say much more about it other its -- we're not in the process of re-pricing or rethinking the product capability. The results that you'll see in our numbers are a reflection of the activity and behavior of our customers as they manage their own baking affairs.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. Another question I had was just on the kind of market related revenues. They've been trending a little bit lower if I combine trading activities, securities gains, equity investment gains and that's even with the student loan gain in that 354 number.", "Should we generically expect that you'll still be able to generate this type of market related revenue or is it more likely that we can trend down over time?", "John Shrewsberry", "So there is lot of moving parts there and I would look at a multi quarter average to think about how to model it. On the trading side, their customer accommodation, customer facing trading revenue that we make, which is a pretty modest part of Wells Fargo revenue profile, but will probably ebb and flow along the lines of what you're seeing in the industry just at a more modest level.", "That also -- the trading line also includes the impact of our deferred comp hedging programs. So it's a little noisy given the magnitude of that versus the magnitude of our trading businesses, but those will be with based on industry factors and the deferred comp programs will be more revenue and more expense in an up market and less revenue and less expense in a down market generally speaking.", "On the other elements, we've got gains from equity securities, gains from debt securities and in the equity space, you've seen some of the businesses that we've been involved in that frankly are -- that continue to be -- are sources of revenue that we would anticipate seeing if market conditions stay the same as they are today.", "So I wouldn\u2019t model that down too heavily. And on the debt side, given the levels of rates that we're at and in some markets the levels of spreads that we're at, there are some debt securities, which it makes sense for us to sell and monetize from time to time just because their market value substantially exceeds what we can imagine as their intrinsic or certainly their carrying value.", "So there will be pops in there from time to time as well. And it's some of those things that gets to that collection that you described.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. And last one, maybe you can just talk a little about the momentum in the trust business and what type of outlook you see just through asset gathering and after a really strong year and in that part of the business. Do you see -- how is the pipeline for asset growth looking?", "John Shrewsberry", "We're very happy and pleased with the progress we've made in that area. One of the biggest opportunities we have is relationship between David Carroll's Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement Group and Carrie Tolstedt's Community Banking Group.", "We have as many assets away from customers who call us their bank as we do under management right now. So the relationship and the working date of their to bring those assets home if you will, has been a big opportunity for us and -- but I still view this.", "Of all the opportunities we have in the company, with all of our businesses probably that is our biggest opportunity to jump a curve or to even do -- to show some incremental growth above what you would see in other more mature businesses.", "So a lot of opportunity there; pleased with where we are, lot more to do.", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks guys. Appreciate it.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.", "Paul Miller", "Yes, thank you very much and there has been a lot of news thrown out today, but on your -- if you mentioned this in the prepared marks I apologize, but your C&I loans jumped up. Is that where the Ginnie Mae financing came through on your balance sheet?", "John Shrewsberry", "No, that's not that Paul.", "Paul Miller", "So that's just pure\u2026", "John Shrewsberry", "The biggest thing to call out is the student loan financing that we did. If you saw the portfolio of student loans and we provided some financing to the company who bought those loans and so if one items stands out in the quarter as outsized, it would be that, but those are all commercial loans.", "Paul Miller", "Yes and is there any particular industry that are doing well? Is it just across the Board and across geographic that this line item picked up? Because this is one of the line items we've been waiting to see pick up in general amongst the bigger ranks.", "John Shrewsberry", "Very broad based.", "John Stumpf", "Very broad.", "Paul Miller", "And you're not saying because the questions that I get is that everybody is concerned about the energy credits, but you're just not seeing and I know you made some opening comments about that, but you're just not seeing anything on the negative side on energy credits at this point.", "John Shrewsberry", "Well this drop in crude is very recent and the companies are taking the appropriate evasive actions to preserve cash, to de-lever, to reduce their expense base etcetera, but it hasn\u2019t worked its way into loan quality.", "Now loan demand certainly will be down in that area I assume, but in the fourth quarter you can see what the change in growth is out there and net outstandings was which more than makes up for whatever reduced demand there is in the energy space.", "Paul Miller", "Okay guys. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.", "Bill Carcache", "Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your credit card growth strategy. I think most would agree that credit card assets yields have held up quite well in this slow rate environment relative to other asset classes.", "Would you consider competing more aggressively on rates in an effort to growth your share of outstanding balances particularly since the high return business where you arguably have room to give up a bit on pricing, while still generating returns that are attractive relative to other lower return over yielding asset classes?", "John Stumpf", "Well let me say it this way. First of all we love the card business, especially for our community bank customers and we've grown from the low to mid 20s penetration to now to 42% of our customers carry our credit card.", "And we like that business a whole lot not only from the balances we get, but to be relevant to our customers as far as handling their payments, providing them services that are even around payments and so forth for them.", "We want to provide great value. Pricing sure is part of that. You've seen recently where we've partnered with American Express. We do a ton of business with Visa on the higher end, higher value cards.", "So this is really a strategy about getting more cards top of wallet with our customers and pricing, rewards, the whole value of proposition is part of that. I wouldn\u2019t say it's just any one thing around price per se, but it around value.", "Bill Carcache", "Great. Thank you. A separate question if I may on municipal deposits, can you talk about how significant municipal deposits are to Wells? Are you deemphasizing them given their relative unfriendly LCR treatment and to what extent do you see future revenue opportunity for holding them?", "John Stumpf", "We have a -- we have a very big municipal business and deposits are certainly part of that. It's a service that we provide to the tax exempt issuing community and by municipal, it's all forms of state and local and country government and other non-profit types of customers.", "The unfriendly LCR treatment came from the fact that municipal deposits tend to be collateralized by us so that their municipal depositor is safer in the event of a problem with their bank and that wasn\u2019t being taken into account in the original approach to LCR.", "We think we've gotten that favorable outcome there, so that they're now LCR friendly. Still very competitive. We still like those deposits. We still very much enjoy those relationships because there is a lot of banking service that we provide to those types of clients, but they don't have the LCR problem that they might have seemed to have in pre-clarification that came out in the third or fourth quarter.", "Bill Carcache", "Okay. So it was my understanding that for the purposes of the LCR calculation in the numerator, the high quality liquid assets would not be able to include the collateral associated with the deposits and then had to outflow in the denominator on day one. Is that not the case anymore?", "John Stumpf", "I don't think that you have it right. I think that it works fine. Incidentally there were two issues that people were trying to address in tweaks to LCR relating to munis.", "The other one was whether high quality muni bonds would be considered HQLA on the asset side and I don't think that there has been a resolution there and there are a number of our customer -- our clients who issue high quality muni bonds to take exception of that and we will see where that goes.", "But on the deposit side, I think we've cracked the code.", "Bill Carcache", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mike Mayo", "Good morning. I had a question about the efficiency ratio. First what were the drivers in higher revenue driven compensation and deferred comp, especially with lower originations and software trading results?", "And then the following question to that is are you still at the upper end of your efficiency target, what can you do to get at least back towards the middle end?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well so the drivers of the revenue oriented portion of increased compensation included a handful of businesses. I would say investment banking was one of them where we were $150 million up in the quarter and so some portion of the elevated expense is attributable to that, but it comes from a few others as well.", "And again to those businesses that performed better in the fourth quarter, so it could be with 90 different businesses, it can be a little here, a little there. That was part of it.", "So we find ourselves in the high 58% or now 59% and with a lot of emphasis on trying to be as efficient as we can and how we spend our money every day. There are no guarantees that we're moving toward the middle of the lower end of the range in this interest rate environment and as we go through a full year.", "While we're tackling the things that we need to tackle, we spend a lot of money on risk management, compliance related initiatives other things that have a regulatory origin and some of that is semi permanent, might be around for several quarters and some of it is going to around the run rate for a while.", "If rates begin to move up that probably moves us down in the range, but it's frankly a 59%, which is the high end of our range where we can tolerate that. We've been performing very well.", "John Stumpf", "Mike, you're hitting one of the important issues for us as. As John mentioned, we take this seriously. We're looking for all those opportunities to eliminate expenses where customers don't find value and it's an ongoing continuous process for us, reducing square footage.", "It's one of those looking hard at the kind of money we spend that is not revenue producing if you will, but also making sure that we take a look at the long term. So we continue to invest in things like late last year Apple Pay and other things that we do to provide convenience for our customers.", "So it's always a don't waste, but also we take a long term view, but this continues to be a big focus for us.", "Mike Mayo", "Well correct me if I am wrong. You have a 55% to 59% efficiency target range and what I am hearing now is, well if the rate environment we might be at 59% whereas I wasn\u2019t sure if I heard that same message before or saying well unless rates go up, we won't get to the middle part of the range and you were a little bit lower before.", "So am I hearing the message wrong or is it simply that you've done what you could for so long with the low rate environment and you can't do a whole lot more or what is it that leads you to say, well, 59% okay.", "John Shrewsberry", "Well I think when we had the range, we knew that we would surely we would love to be at 55%, but we also recognized that that's how we gave a range. These were -- think of as guardrails and we're spending more in cyber today. We're spending more on all things risk.", "On the other hand, we've not yet pulled out all of our expenses around loss mitigation. We continue to make investments in distribution. So I guess a range is a range and I can't guarantee with the lower end, but if we were at the high end that's also acceptable.", "In our mind, if we're making the right investments, in the right things and eliminating expenses where we think they can be eliminated. So that's how we feel about it.", "Mike Mayo", "And then last follow-up the cyber expenses or the all things risk expenses, have these ticked up some, or is this kind of what you had expected?", "John Shrewsberry", "They've ticked up in the terms of we continue to make more investments there and we're starting to get the annualization of expenses we made last year. And we'll get more efficient in that over time, but we're spending -- we're spending the money we think we need to spend.", "And sometimes that's hiring consultants and then over time you can convert whatever they're doing to team members, which tends to be more efficient, you're not as efficient in every process, the minute you adopted it or employ it, but more money has been spent there.", "Mike Mayo", "All there. Thank you.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "If I could follow-up on the net interest margin was down just two basis points, which I think was very good in this kind of environment. As I look at some of the underlying detail on the yields of the securities and some of the loan yields.", "I guess I don't totally understand how they've been so stable and wondering if there is anything you can add on maybe first the securities, you've been growing it and the yields have been remarkably resilient.", "John Shrewsberry", "It's just math. What we've been growing hasn\u2019t been that extraordinary in terms of its incremental contribution to the way that it average because the denominators is big as it is.", "If we continue to deploy as I know you know, if we continue deploying in this environment, ultimately it will start to skew down the way it averaged return and also we've been tending to invest in treasury and agency securities and just from a credit quality point of view, that's going to bring down returns, setting aside the historical book yields versus current book yields and the shape of the current when the investments were made.", "If we've got corporates and munis and some other things in the starting portfolio, if we're just adding U.S. treasuries, it's going to bring things down, but it just hasn\u2019t revealed itself yet because the numbers haven\u2019t been big enough yet.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Okay. And then on the loan yields, I guess they've been surprisingly resilient as well. Do you feel like -- I know it's a blend of eight or ten categories the way you disclose it, but do you feel like generally speaking loan yields have stabilized and I am looking at the C&I that was actually up a couple bips, but really up and down the portfolio.", "It feels like there has been pretty good stability the last three or four quarters.", "John Shrewsberry", "I think that's right. We're in fiercely competitive markets. Not every bit of composition is in the last phase. It's point of spread on a loan. Sometimes it's in the structure of a loan and of course there are places we'll back away from when that happens, but it is competitive, but it hasn\u2019t all shown up in price.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Okay. And then I mean I just -- I guess putting it all together as you think about the next margin percent going forward, probably largely dependent on loan growth, but how do you think it shapes out?", "Obviously the rates where they are doesn\u2019t help but is it just as modest pressure of is there more material pressure to come?", "John Shrewsberry", "It depends on the pace of continued deposit inflows and how that gets redeployed. If deposits remain steady where they are, then the loan growth and the redeployment from cash into investment securities is going to be very supportive of the Inco.", "If we get keep getting high single-digit or even low double-digit deposit growth and it doesn\u2019t make and loan growth isn\u2019t happening at the same pace where redeploying into investment securities doesn\u2019t make sense at the same pace, then the math is going to put pressure on that calculation.", "And as you know, that's not a calculation we're managing to. It's an outcome of the other things that we're doing, but the driver there is the growth in deposit and how you responsibly deploy that into either loans or securities in the same timeframe that the deposits are coming in.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Okay. All right makes sense. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi. Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Hi Betsy.", "John Shrewsberry", "Hi Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hey, I had a question on investment spend and thoughts around mobile wallet with Apple Pay obviously you did a lot of work there, is there an opportunity to take those investments and potentially expand them into mobile wallet, real time banking other tokenization strategies?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well we're doing a lot of work in all those things, but the so called paperless store and doing real time cash letters and helping customers with real-time information not understanding which channel they're involved.", "And so I would say all the above is important. What we've found, which is interesting is that our most loyal customers today are ones who use the channels most often and the most types of channels.", "So even for those customers who are very advanced technology and use of technology, ease of technology who might be dominant in that channel, still visit stores on a infrequent but regular basis. They go to ATMs. So there is lots of things.", "And we're making -- some of the investments we're making is to set up an appointment with the banker using your technology. We're testing things about being able to authenticate customers knowing they are in the stores, working on things that would authenticate an ATM machine, maybe using your mobile on.", "So there is mobile devices, so there is just lots of things going on there. And we're actually leaning a lot of those things from retailers and other service providers outside of our industry. So pretty exciting stuff.", "Betsy Graseck", "And do you feel this is like table stakes and will just maintain share or do you think that you're doing things that could potentially drive share up, drive down that expense ratio?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well I think about less or an expense ratio, but these are more than table -- while they're table stakes in some cases, if you don't have a mobile offering, you're probably not going to serve most millennials today.", "But we think of it more than table stakes. We think it's a big reason why we're growing net new primary tech new account where we're 5% a year.", "The positive growth we've had clearly is a result of -- partially a result of our distribution model and the Omni channel view we have of these various channels, not separate businesses, but combined into really centric around the customer needs and convenience. And our growth is I think reflective of our commitment to that.", "Betsy Graseck", "And I guess I am just wondering too on a Dillard\u2019s because I would expect that retailers also want best-in-class mobile apps etcetera, is this part of what we should expect you'll be delivering to Dillard\u2019s and other private liable portfolios that you're in?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well I don't want to speak about a particular situation, but I'll just give you this. 16 years ago, we didn't have an online offering. Today over 80% of the customers are actively online, some 28 million or 24 million customers actively online on the consumer side.", "Five years ago we didn't have a mobile offering. Today we have over 14 million customers on that. I mean mobile is the fastest growing, fastest adopted channel we've had in our history of our company.", "And the things that customers can now do mobally and the things that they\u2019ll be able to do in the next year or two as we continue to introduce new capabilities is really exciting. So watch for this. It's really important.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. Thanks.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning.", "John Pancari", "On the -- kick the energy horse here again, so my apologies, but first of all can you just help quantify your total leverage loan book what the size is? And then of that leverage loan book, how much of it is energy?", "John Stumpf", "Sure, so we don't have a leverage loan book. We have loan portfolios in various lines of business. We have an energy loan portfolio, which would include both oil and gas and as I mentioned, it's about 2% of our loans overall and it includes E&P companies. It includes mid stream, pipeline companies and it includes services companies. It also includes some investment grade integrated oil names.", "But some of that is about 2% of our total loan portfolio. Some of those companies will have higher leverage. Some of those companies will have lower leverage, but we don't draw the portfolio line along the level of leverage.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And then separately related to that, do you have the amount of bond exposure that you may have held in your trading portfolios for any deals that you've done in the energy sector? Do you have that quantified?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, it's a good question. So I'll quantify for you our total securities exposure including what's in trading and also what's in AFS because we have some -- we have some corporate investments in energy names as well.", "And the sum total of both of those is less than a $1.5 billion at Wells Fargo and it's much smaller portion in trading which of course gives mark-to-market through the P&L every day and somewhat larger percentage of that is sitting in AFS, which we mark every day, but the value change goes through OCI.", "John Pancari", "Okay. All right. And then separately on the loan growth I agree good pick up that we saw in C&I for the quarter, and as we look out into 2015, is it fair to assume that you should see some acceleration in the loan growth that you're looking at for 2015 versus what you achieved in 2014.", "I think you're in the 4% to 5% range for 2014. Is it fair to assume that, that accelerates from there next year or for the full year 2015?", "John Shrewsberry", "I think knowing what we know about the economy today, we feel better about the next four quarters than couple of the last four quarters. So if the most recent quarter is the continuation of a two quarter trend, then yes, we'll probably have higher loan growth or higher amounts originated.", "Now if the denominator keeps growing as we grow the size of the portfolio and at some point the rate gets impacted by that. But yes, it feels like a good year for loan growth.", "John Stumpf", "You know John, we think if you're going to grow revenues over the long run, you have to be growing households, cross-sell deposits and loans and we share a plan for all of those.", "John Pancari", "Okay. All right. And my last question. I know there are some questions around the excess liquidity reinvestment and what you've been buying, I know you indicate you're buying treasuries and agencies.", "Do you have what durations and what yields that you purchased in the quarter? Just to get an idea of what the ultimate impact could be on the margin?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, we don't lay out quite that way. You'll see in our tables what we're talking about, but its treasuries and agencies you know the timeframe and I can tell you we're in the intermediate part of the curve. So that will probably get you there.", "John Pancari", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Good morning, Eric. Oh Regina, he dropped.", "Operator", "Eric, your line is open.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Hi, can you hear me?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, hi Eric.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Oh! Hi. That was an odd, because I was not on mute and I have the telephone at least once before. Just to follow-up on the OpEx for a moment, I understand the discussion of the ratio, but just in terms of absolute level, based on what I am hearing in terms of your loan growth expectation, it sounds like we should be anticipating an absolute level of expense that is higher than what we saw in 2014. Is that correct?", "John Stumpf", "It's really tough to say, which is why we're talking percentages and think about things in terms of a range and you can see the items that we're calling out as feeling seasonal in Q4 and there is a handful of them and there an amount to a few $100 million.", "And then of course in Q1, we typically have escalated personnel in benefits expense as well.", "In terms of the OpEx of the investments that we're making in risk management etcetera, they will be elevated for some period of time, but because of all of the other drivers to the total expense number.", "It's possible that we operate and there is a reasonable expectation that we operate at a lower level than we have in the last couple of quarters because we're always pushing down on things where we can.", "So that's why we give you the range. We think we're going to be in the range in 2015 like we have been in 2014. One other item I had mentioned for those other new two that we do have this deferred comp element that shows up in expense even though it's a P&L neutral item and that creates in some cases a couple $100 million worth of noise in any given quarter, which is material given the differences that we're talking about here.", "John Shrewsberry", "But Eric even though we're at the high end of the range now, one should not assume that it's not top of mind around here, it is. It is. It range top of mind and it's always looking for opportunities to be more efficient, but also continue to invest in the future because we do have a long term view.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Right. Of course. And the financing that you provided on the student loan sale, what is the expected duration of that?", "John Shrewsberry", "So that financing probably comes down over the course of next couple of years on a relatively steep curve as the portfolio gets permanently financed into student loan ABS and so my expectation I think the reasonable expectation is that it's average life would be maybe a little bit more than a year as it comes down.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Got it. And just quickly one last thing, the tax benefit that you mentioned in the period from the change in federal tax law, is that a permanent benefit and what should we expect for your kind of go forward GAAP tax rate?", "John Shrewsberry", "So what happened in the fourth quarter is both the impact of the extender legislation that came in at the end of the year as well as the resolution of some discrete matters that we've been working on with the various taxing authorities for some period of time.", "I would look at recent prior years for what the reason of what a good expectation is for a tax rate going forward.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Okay. So largely unchanged, it sounds like.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, I think that's right.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "All right. Thanks very much.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Please go ahead.", "Chris Mutascio", "Good morning, guys; Happy New Year to you.", "John Stumpf", "Happy New Year to you, Chris.", "Chris Mutascio", "I have a quick question for John Shrewsberry, you noted that your investment securities portfolio was increasing quite materially over last year; I think it's up about $50 billion. Can you tell me what portion of that is Ginnie Mae, MBS? How much is that Ginnie Mae portfolio.", "If you have exposure has it grown in '14?", "John Shrewsberry", "It's negligible.", "Chris Mutascio", "Okay. Because I am assuming the refinance activity there with a 50 basis point cut, plus rates being down, I didn't know what the impact would be perhaps on the margin, but your Ginnie Mae exposure is negligible.", "John Shrewsberry", "Negligible.", "Chris Mutascio", "All right. Thank you very much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Bush", "Good morning, guys.", "John Stumpf", "Happy New Year, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush", "Happy New Year. Two questions for you. John you mentioned the changes at in the GSEs and at the FHA with regard to allowable mortgages etcetera. There seems to have been a remarkable turnaround in Washington since the days the financial crises when everybody was cracking down on mortgages and we're in a reverse posture now.", "As a result of this, do you see any changes that you might make at the mortgage company in terms of businesses that you exited, the wholesale business etcetera that you might want to go back and revisit?", "John Stumpf", "No, well first of all, I think those are positive changes that have been made and I think they've been largely made because it got too restrictive and customers who deserved a loan, who wanted to buy a home could afford it, could not get credit.", "And I am not -- I don't want to overstate the amount of those folks, but there was that element and I think we've come to a much better place with regulators, with the industry and with customers.", "But no, we don't have an intention of going back into joint ventures or the wholesale business. We like the business mix we have now.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. Second question is this. There was -- I believe a heard on the Street column a few days ago in the Wall Street Journal about the impact of the energy price drop on various banks and John I think they mentioned that the figure of 17% of revenues comes to mind with regard to your capital markets businesses related to energy.", "Could you just clarify that where you stand in capital markets with relation to the energy business and is there going to be a big impact in revenues there?", "John Stumpf", "So in that article they referred to I think geologic information for 2014 that suggested that we had about $280 million worth of underwriting revenue from energy related activity. So that would be debt and equity underwriting and probably loan syndication fees as well.", "So that's the order of magnitude. The 17% would refer to that as a percentage of the investment banking revenue -- U.S. investment banking revenue for full year of 2014.", "So if in terms of at risk or where it goes from here, that's a starting point for last year. And it bounced around between I don't know, $150 million and maybe $300 million over the course of the last several years.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. And just one more question John Stumpf for you, you've been very positive on the direction of the American economy for the last couple of quarters and I think you remain that way. Well I don't know if you saw your predecessor Mr. Kovacevich on CNBC a couple of mornings ago and he was not so positive on the strength of the American economy.", "I am sure you still talk to Dick from time to time and sort of what is behind the differing views?", "John Stumpf", "What was his name again?", "Nancy Bush", "That K guy.", "John Stumpf", "Oh! The K guy. Well I obviously respect Dick's view and there are different views in the economy, but that being said when I -- and there is volatility clearly. Today, look at retail sales and if I feel differently, so you can feel differently on a day to day basis.", "But when I look at the businesses that we're in and as I am talking with customers which I am every day and talking with our business leaders and frankly looking at the numbers, 50 consecutive months of employment growth. Unemployment in the five, six range. GDP 5% and will probably have a few quarters this year that start with 3%.", "So I am optimistic. I don't think -- again I don't think this is a breakout, but I think we're on the front foot and consumer's confidence is at a all time high since the downturn. So the way I read the tea leaves, I'm optimistic.", "John Shrewsberry", "I think Dick also suggest that we could have gotten here sooner. We could be at higher levels\u2026", "John Stumpf", "And actually I agree with that.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.", "Marty Mosby", "Hello and well, glad to have wrap it up for you. If you look at the capital deployment ratios, if you look at your total payout this quarter of 72%, which is I think close to your stated target you talked about around 75%.", "So the increased capital deployment from here, are you going to need to see some earnings momentum or do you think you could push pass at 75% payout ratio?", "John Shrewsberry", "So our target is 55% to 75% and you saw that it bounced around during the course of the four quarters of 2014 for a few reasons. One of them is that we do more share issuance in connection with our benefit plans in the first half of the year and so it drives down the net payout ratio.", "The first call on our capital is to be available to support more loan growth on behalf of our customers. So the capital deployment horse is out in front of the net payout cart and that's important to remember because we're not hoping that we have enough to support the business growth after we think about distribution.", "We're making sure we have enough to support the business growth and then we're factoring in distribution behind that. So we anticipate continuing to operate in the range quarter by quarter, 55% to 75% and the fourth quarter was a high take on that in the 70s.", "Marty Mosby", "And that was really kind of looking back towards the E part of that, which is as earnings grow, that gives you more chance, what kind of catalyst do you see until -- while we're waiting on interest rates to create some incremental earnings momentum kind of reigniting that, that we've seen kind of slow down over the last couple of quarters?", "John Stumpf", "Sure, well its loan growth for sure. It's redeployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding earning assets. It will be what the impact is on expenses that we've been talking a lot a little bit, if we do as expected there.", "And then it's the various sources of fee revenue, which have which reflect quarter to quarter, up year-over-year, but there is a lot of momentum in places like card, places like investment banking, trust and investment fees overall.", "We just talked about the slightly more bullish case for mortgage this year. All of those are catalysts for growth.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks.", "John Stumpf", "Yes. Thank you.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you. And thanks everybody who joined us today and again Happy New Year to everybody and thanks for your interest in Wells Fargo.

Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We earned $5.8 billion in the first quarter, which reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and our continued focus on the real economy. By building relationships with our existing customers and successfully generating new relationships during the past year, we were able to grow loans and deposits and increase our revenue. Our capital levels remained strong and we continued to focus on rewarding our shareholders by increasing our dividend and reducing our shares outstanding.", "Let me highlight our growth during the quarter compared with a year ago. We generated $21.3 billion of revenue, up 3% from a year ago with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. We had broad-based loan growth with our core loan portfolio increasing by $54.2 billion or 7%. Our deposit franchise continued to generate strong customer and balanced growth with total deposits reaching a record $1.2 trillion, up $102.1 billion or 9%, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.7%. Our credit performance continued to be very strong with net charge-offs down $117 million and our net charge-off ratio declined to 33 basis points.", "Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation and returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority. Our net payout ratio was 61% in the first quarter. We\u2019re extremely pleased that our 2015 capital plan allows us to increase our quarterly dividend by 7% to $0.375 per common share for the second quarter of this year, of course subject to board approval. Our ability to increase our dividend every year since 2011 demonstrates the benefits of our diversified business model and conservative risk management, as well as our disciplined capital management process.", "We have over 90 different businesses that are benefiting from the continued strength in the U.S. economy. While the first quarter economic headlines again demonstrated that the economic recovery has been uneven, I believe the underlying economic expansion that is approaching its sixth anniversary remains largely on track. Interest rates remain low, homes are affordable, consumer and small business confidence remains high, and the labor market is approaching full employment after a record 54 consecutive monthly payroll gains. I\u2019m optimistic that the improving U.S. economy will continue to provide Wells Fargo with many opportunities to better serve our customers, our communities, and reward our shareholders.", "John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our first quarter results. John?", "John Shrewsberry", "Thanks John, and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions.", "Wells Fargo had another strong quarter, earning $5.8 billion and $1.04 in EPS in the first quarter and returning net $3.3 billion of capital to shareholders. Our results were driven by average loan and deposit growth and lower expenses while we maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions. Our results also benefited from a net $359 million discrete tax benefit in the first quarter primarily from a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the resolution of prior period matters with U.S. federal and state taxing authorities. As a reminder, we also had a $423 million discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of last year. We take a prudent approach in accounting for our tax liability, which can result in discrete tax benefits depending on the resolution of prior period matters with taxing authorities.", "Page 3 highlights our results compared with a year ago, including increased revenue and pre-tax pre-provision profit, strong loan and deposit growth, and lower share count reflecting net share repurchases.", "Page 4 highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income in the first quarter. The benefit of the diversity of our 90-plus businesses was demonstrated by our ability to grow both net interest income and non-interest income in the first quarter compared with a year ago, which was a key driver of our performance. As I\u2019ve highlighted in the past, the drivers of our fee generation vary based on interest rates and economic conditions. For example, market-sensitive revenue, which includes trading and gains from debt and equity investments, declined 22% from a year ago, dropping from 14% to fee income to 11%. However, other businesses had strong growth and we generated higher trust and investment, card and mortgage banking fee income. With this broad-based growth, we were able to grow fee income 3% from a year ago.", "Let me highlight some key drivers of our first quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on Page 5. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We generated core loan and deposit growth and have increased liquidity and capital to record levels. Let me take a minute to describe how we\u2019re managing in the current rate environment.", "We\u2019ve been able to perform well across a variety of rate cycles over time because of the diversification of the business model. We\u2019re often asked about how we manage our interest rate risk, in particular the timing of making investments in a lower rate environment. As you might imagine, we evaluate our interest rate risk position continuously and frequently weigh options to alter the overall sensitivity of the balance sheet. We consider factors such as the expected growth in loans and deposits performance under a wide range of rate scenarios and the trade-offs between the protection from lower rates afforded by adding duration, and the consequences of those actions in higher rate scenarios. Based upon these analyses, we then make decisions about the kind of instruments we use. We can purchase securities outright or extend the duration of variable rate loans with interest rate swaps and the magnitude and profile of the duration we add. All in all, we try to balance a number of considerations and maintain flexibility as conditions evolve.", "Turning to the income statement on Page 6, revenue declined from fourth quarter as net interest income was lower, reflecting two fewer days in the first quarter and lower income from variable sources; however, non-interest income grew from the fourth quarter even though the fourth quarter included a $217 million gain on the sale of government-guaranteed student loans. The growth in fee income reflected momentum across our businesses, which I\u2019ll highlight throughout the call.", "As shown on Page 7, we continued to have strong broad-based loan growth in the first quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core loan portfolio grew by $54.2 billion or 7% from a year ago, and was up $914 million from the fourth quarter. Linked quarter commercial loan growth was driven by real estate, construction and lease financing. Consumer loans grew slightly as growth in non-conforming mortgage, auto, security-based lending, and student loans was largely offset by payoffs in the junior lien portfolio and seasonality in credit cards.", "On Page 8, we highlight our loan portfolios that had strong year-over-year growth. C&I loans were up $31.9 billion or 13% from a year ago, with broad-based growth across most of our wholesale businesses. Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $13 billion or 7% from a year ago, reflecting continued growth in high-quality non-conforming mortgages, primarily jumbo loans. The credit quality of our core mortgage portfolio remains strong with only 7 basis points of credit losses in the first quarter.", "Credit card balances were up $4 billion or 15% from a year ago, benefiting from strong new account growth and the Dillards portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter. Auto loans were up $3.7 billion or 7% from last year. While we continued to benefit from the strong auto market, new originations were down 10% from a year ago, reflecting our continued risk and pricing discipline in a competitive market.", "As you can see on Page 9, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the first quarter, up $97.5 billion from a year ago and up $25 billion from fourth quarter. Our average deposit cost was 9 basis points, consistent with the fourth quarter and down 2 basis points from a year ago. We successfully grew primary consumer checking customers by 5.7% from a year ago and primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5.5%. Our ability to consistently grow primary checking customers is important because these customers have more interactions with us, have higher cross-sell, and are more than twice as profitable as non-primary checking customers.", "We grew net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis by $396 million or 4% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in average earning assets, up $170 billion or 12%. Net interest income declined $190 million from fourth quarter due to two fewer days in the first quarter and lower variable income. The net interest margin declined 9 basis points from the fourth quarter due to strong customer-driven deposit growth. This reduced the margin by 5 basis points but had minimal impact to net interest income. Lower interest income from variable sources due to reduced loan fees and PCI loan recoveries decreased the margin by 3 basis points. Liquidity-related activity, which was not LCR-related but taken to demonstrate market access and the liquidity of our securities portfolio, reduced the margin by 1 basis point. All other balance sheet and repricing did not impact the margin in the first quarter.", "Our balance sheet remained asset-sensitive and we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from higher rates. We believe we can grow net interest income in 2015 compared with 2014 even if rates remain low, as we demonstrated last year.", "Total non-interest income increased $29 million from fourth quarter and grew $282 million from a year ago, up 3%. Trading gains increased $229 million from fourth quarter, primarily from higher customer accommodation trading, reflecting better markets in high grade/high yield and RNBS, as well as seasonality. Mortgage banking revenue increased $32 million from fourth quarter on higher origination volume, up $5 billion or 11%. Fifty-five percent of originations were for refinancing, up from 40% in the fourth quarter as rates declined. We ended the quarter with a $44 billion application pipeline, the highest pipeline since the second quarter of 2013, and we expect funding volumes to increase in the second quarter given the size of the pipeline and the seasonal home buying that typically occurs during the second quarter spring buying season.", "Our gain on sale ratio increased to 2.06% in the first quarter as pricing margins expanded, reflecting strong refinance volume and lenders priced to balance volumes and capacity. We currently expect the second quarter gain on sale ratio to be at the higher end of the range we\u2019ve seen over the past five quarters, 140 basis points to 206 basis points.", "Servicing income declined $162 million from the fourth quarter as MSR results declined $127 million, reflecting higher prepayment expectations associated with reductions in FHA mortgage insurance premiums. This valuation adjustment directly reduced our servicing results in the quarter.", "As shown on Page 12, expenses were down $140 million from the fourth quarter. Our first quarter expenses included $452 million of seasonally higher employee benefits expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401k matching, as well as $236 million for annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. These seasonally higher expenses were offset by lower salaries, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter, lower revenue-based incentive compensation and reduced outside professional services, equipment, travel and entertainment, and advertising expenses. While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense, reflecting high day count and annual merit increases, and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter, such as outside professional services and advertising expenses, are also expected to increase.", "Our efficiency ratio improved to 58.8% in the first quarter, and we expect the efficiency ratio for the full year 2015 to remain within our targeted range of 55 to 59%.", "Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.7 billion in the first quarter, down 5% from a year ago and up 7% from the fourth quarter. As I highlighted earlier, we had continued strong growth in primary consumer checking customers, up 5.7% from a year ago. Our broad-based and industry-leading distribution channels are one reason for this growth. While our customers actively use all of our channels, including more than 75% of our deposit customers visiting a banking store at least once within the last six months, mobile banking is growing the fastest. We had 14.9 million active mobile customers, up 19% from a year ago. Our customers are increasingly using this channel with mobile banking sessions up 38% in 2014, while customer usage of our stores has remained stable.", "We also continue to successfully grow retail bank households. February was our highest monthly net gain of retail bank households in four years. These new households provide us with growth opportunities as we focus on meeting their financial needs through our diversified product line. An example of how we\u2019re capturing this opportunity is in our debit and credit card businesses, with card fees up 11% from a year ago. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% and credit card purchase volume increased 16% from a year ago. Our credit card business continued to have strong new account growth and active account growth.", "Wholesale banking earned $1.8 billion in the first quarter, up 3% from a year ago and down 9% from fourth quarter. Loan growth continued to be strong with average loans up $35.7 billion or 12% from a year ago, with broad-based growth across many businesses. We\u2019re excited about our announcement last week regarding the purchase of $9 billion of commercial real estate mortgage loans from GE Capital. This is a portfolio of performing loans primarily in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada, which are active lending markets for us. We also agreed to provide $4 billion of financing to Blackstone Mortgage Trust for their purchase of a commercial mortgage portfolio. We expect these transactions to close in the second and third quarters of this year. This is an excellent example of how the combination of our balance sheet strength, the expertise of our team members and our relationship focus positions us to capture opportunities for growth, both organically and through acquisition.", "While we remain disciplined in deposit pricing, we continue to benefit from strong deposit growth with average core deposits up $44.4 billion or 17% from a year ago. Wholesale banking also had broad-based fee growth, up 11% from a year ago with many of our diversified businesses growing at double digits. Investment banking fees grew 44% from a year ago, and we increased our market share to 4.9%. This growth reflected continued improvement in our equity capital markets and investment-grade originations. Treasury management revenue grew 11%, reflecting new product sales and repricing.", "Wealth brokerage and retirement earned a record $561 million in first quarter, up 18% from a year ago and up 9% from fourth quarter. WBR\u2019s pre-tax margin was 24% in the first quarter, close to their long-term target of 25%. These strong results reflected 8% revenue growth from a year ago driven by 12% growth in net interest income and 8% growth in asset-based fees. The partnership between WBR and community banking has been successful, generating over $1 billion a month in closed referred investment assets. During the past year, 58% of referred assets were from new investment clients of Wells Fargo.", "We\u2019re also benefiting from increasing our license to private bankers in our banking stores by 15% from a year ago. This partnership has also contributed to the growth in brokerage advisory assets, which were $435 billion, up 12% from a year ago.", "WBR\u2019s strong loan growth continued, up 14% from a year ago, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans and security-based lending.", "Turning to Page 16, credit quality in the first quarter remained strong with our net charge-off ratio declining to 33 basis points of average loans. Non-performing assets have declined for 10 consecutive quarters and were down $618 million from fourth quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $338 million and foreclosed assets declined $280 million. The reserve release was $100 million in the first quarter, down $150 million from fourth quarter and down $400 million from a year ago.", "Let me update you on our energy portfolio. We had $18.5 billion of oil and gas loans at the end of the first quarter, or 2% of total loans outstanding. The size of this portfolio was relatively stable from fourth quarter, up only $65 million. Approximately 55% of our portfolio was in the exploration and production, or upstream sector. We\u2019ve been an industry leader in the energy sector for over 40 years, and we take a disciplined approach to not only underwriting but also managing these loans and relationships. Our teams constantly monitor and evaluate this portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis.", "In the first quarter, we performed an even greater review of each loan in this portfolio, and in March we began the spring redetermination process for our reserve-based loans. We realized minimal credit losses related to energy loans in the first quarter and our allowance at the end of the first quarter contemplated the inherent credit losses associated with our oil and gas exposure.", "Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III, using the advanced approach fully phased in at 10.53% in the first quarter. Last month, the Federal Reserve and the OCC announced that we may begin using the advanced approach\u2019s capital framework starting in the second quarter. This approval did not include stipulations requiring us to increase our current advanced approach RWA.", "We returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and net share repurchases. Our common shares outstanding declined by 7 million shares in the first quarter, reflecting 48 million shares purchased during the quarter partially offset by 41 million shares issued, primarily through employee benefit plans which are seasonally high in the first quarter. In addition, we entered into a $750 million forward repurchase contract that settled earlier this month for 14 million shares. We expect to reduce our common shares outstanding through share repurchases throughout the remainder of the year. As John noted earlier on the call, our 2015 capital plan included a proposed increase to our second quarter dividend to $0.375 per common share, subject to board approval.", "In summary, the first quarter demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model, as shown by the results we highlight on Slide 19. Through our consistent focus on serving our customers in the real economy, we have realized growth across many of our businesses that will help drive future momentum. We\u2019ve grown primary consumer checking and small business and business banking checking customers. We\u2019ve added new credit card accounts, increased debit card purchase volume, and achieved strong retail bank household growth. Mortgage originations have grown, commercial card volume has increased, and we\u2019ve grown investment banking market share. Treasury management fees have grown at a double-digit rate. We\u2019ve increased assets under management, and we have higher retail brokerage managed account assets. I\u2019m optimistic that our diversified business model will continue to generate opportunities for growth and will enable us to continue to invest in our businesses.", "We will now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions]", "Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Erika Najarian", "Yes, good morning. Thank you so much for giving us a detailed rundown in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about your liquidity strategy. I also appreciate the $28.4 billion in deposit growth came from consumer and escrow, but taking a step back, of the $1.2 trillion in period-end deposits, how much would you classify as non-operational corporate? I guess we\u2019re just wondering is adopting a similar strategy as your other large bank peers on non-operating deposits, will that be able to alleviate some of the liquidity pressure on the NIM without much give-up on the LCR?", "John Shrewsberry", "It\u2019s a good question, and I\u2019d say the answer is we\u2019re not impacted in the same way as some of the other banks who have gone to the measures that they have announced to discourage those types of deposits. We\u2019re not constrained by the leverage ratio at this point. We\u2019re not meaningfully impacted by institutional non-operational deposits in our GSIB score, and so we\u2019re serving institutional customers and in some cases taking their deposits if it makes sense in the context of the bigger relationship, but we\u2019re not in the same position as the couple of banks who have had to go out of their way to drive down either leverage--change their leverage outcome or drive down their GSIB score.", "So we will--we\u2019re thinking about those relationships in a way where we can do the most good for Wells Fargo shareholders, so if other people are charging more or are consolidating business activity to be willing to take those deposits, there\u2019s an opportunity for us to improve our business with those same types of customers, but it\u2019s not quite as urgent because we don\u2019t have those problems.", "Erika Najarian", "I guess a better way to think about it is a lot of this excess deposit growth is going to be positive for your LCR and NSFR, given that it looks like it\u2019s mostly retail, so low outflow, high ASF factor type of deposits.", "John Stumpf", "That\u2019s correct. And Erika, the other thing that I know you\u2019re aware of, we love the entire relationships, so surely on the retail side but it\u2019s even true on the wholesale side. When we become the primary account holder, or think of it as a financial partner with a customer and deposits lead with that, good things happen. So that\u2019s all part of serving customers broadly and deeply.", "Erika Najarian", "Just as a follow-up, then I\u2019ll step back, you\u2019ve been very consistent in terms of falling in that 55 to 59% efficiency ratio range, and you\u2019re consistent in terms of your forward guidance. Again, given some of the other large bank guidance in efficiency out there, will it take rates for Wells Fargo to move further down to the 55% portion of that range?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, that would be one way to do it. An increase in rates, which would have an increase in revenue without a lot of associated expense, would do that. There are other ways to move a little bit lower in the range, depending on the mix of where revenue comes from and the initiatives that we have to manage expenses. But we\u2019re comfortable in the range, we\u2019re at the higher end of the range today, which is still an industry-leading level, and these other folks who are enacting their efficiency plans are coming towards us so we\u2019re going to keep doing what we\u2019re doing.", "John Stumpf", "But we\u2019re not standing still. We watch every expense around here as we repurpose dollars we save into things that we have to invest in.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Bill Carcache", "Thank you, good morning. Can you put into context for us whether the investment opportunities that you discussed that you see before you at the moment are--do you see them as growing, or are they getting harder to identify as you look ahead at, say, the next 12 months versus the last 12 months? Then relating to these investment opportunities, how should we be thinking about the trajectory of your payout ratio longer term? As you generate more capital going forward, is it fair just to view your payout ratio as being inversely related to your investment opportunities? I guess I\u2019m asking from the perspective of kind of general overall view that higher payout ratios are better, but I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s really how we should be thinking about it for Wells Fargo, given that your capital position is already largely optimized and you\u2019re not sitting on a lot of excess capital at the moment, so whether or not we should be thinking about that.", "John Shrewsberry", "So by investment opportunities, are you referring to our deployment of liquidity, or are you referring to, like the GE Capital case, where we\u2019re buying a portfolio of loans with customers?", "Bill Carcache", "I think the GE Capital case, any other RWA growth for attractive return generation.", "John Shrewsberry", "So serving our customers and deploying our capital in that way is the first call on our capital. We\u2019re trying to grow earning assets with customers with cross-sell benefit and create new and bigger relationships with customers that we have. So certainly a certain amount of that factored into our capital plan, so that we are imagining doing that while returning capital to shareholders at a high level; but if the landscape were to shift so that the opportunity became more meaningful for us to originate more assets and in some cases acquire more assets that are good for us, then I think we\u2019d be looking long and hard at that.", "John Stumpf", "As far as the return on capital to shareholders, I think our record speaks for itself, and I know John mentioned it in his comments that we very much appreciate investment our shareholders have made in us and that we\u2019re stewards of their capital, and returning as much of that as is prudent is what we plan on doing and want to do. There is no reason for us just to keep adding capital. On the other hand, first call is to grow the business, as John mentioned, and we will return as much, as I mentioned, as we prudently can, as you just saw recently with our increase in our dividend, or at least the ability to increase the dividend.", "John Shrewsberry", "And the trick, of course, is to only take advantage of investment opportunities that are capable of generating the kind of return on equity that we\u2019ve been generating, and to keep distributions up to keep our capital level at the point - you use the term optimized - so that we\u2019re not carrying excess capital that\u2019s harder to produce that return on. That\u2019s the balance.", "Bill Carcache", "That\u2019s very helpful. My last question is on the dynamic that we\u2019re seeing with loan growth outpacing deposit growth across the banking system as a whole, but for the larger banks, including Wells Fargo, I guess we\u2019re still seeing deposit growth outpacing loan growth. I was hoping that you could just talk about what you think may be driving that, and do you see anything on the horizon that you think could change that; in other words, just lead to loan growth outpacing deposit growth at the large banks as well.", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, I think every large bank has a slightly different business mix, and so whatever accounts for their loan growth is going to be unique to them. In our case, because we\u2019ve done such a good job at attracting retail households and attracting wholesale relationships that are bringing meaningful liquidity in, deposit growth has been outpacing loan growth for some time, and it would take a big move in loan growth - which could include utilization of existing credit facilities or incremental funded loans - in order to catch up with that. It would have to be in a higher economic growth environment, I think, for loan growth to get into the 9% range, which is where deposits have been.", "Now, if we\u2019re buying portfolios of loans like we are in the next couple of quarters, that will certainly have an impact on that, but that\u2019s not probably something that you would project into the future at that same pace. So I don\u2019t see that turning around in the near term.", "John Stumpf", "In fact, these are some of the strongest deposit growth years I\u2019ve seen in my 30-some years with the company, and I think it\u2019s partly because of the way we work together as a company, our distribution, the convenience we provide for customers, our focus on this. So it\u2019s been very strong, and all signs are that we\u2019ll continue to have a very strong deposit growth profile.", "John Shrewsberry", "And at 9 basis points, it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re overpaying.", "John Stumpf", "No, exactly.", "Bill Carcache", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "John McDonald", "Hi, good morning. John, we wanted to just go back to the efficiency ratio. Is it reasonable to expect as long as rates stay low and credit is as good as it is right now, you\u2019re likely to stay at the upper end of your targeted range? I think John Shrewsberry, you said last call you\u2019d be okay staying at the higher end of the--you know, in this kind of environment. Is there any expenses that are kind of still cyclically elevated? Maybe just give a little more color there.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, we\u2019re continuing to--we\u2019re always looking for ways to be, as John said, as efficiency as we can and to make the most of every dollar we spend. At the same time, now is the time when there are big demands in information security and compliance and risk management, and so if we\u2019re finding dollars on the efficiency side of the ledger, we\u2019re reinvesting them either in products and services for our customers or in becoming best-in-class across all risk management aspects. So that\u2019s probably going to keep us here at the higher end of the range, unless we have a breakout in some revenue category or we have an increase in rates, which is fine. At 58, 59%, it\u2019s still an attractive level to be performing at, and we\u2019re improving our company every day.", "John McDonald", "Okay, and on TLAC, John, is there some thoughts that you could share in terms of preparing for TLAC? The rules, obviously, aren\u2019t finished yet, but are you taking steps to prepare for your assessment of the most likely proposal that you\u2019d see on that front?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure, so we\u2019ve got a variety of analyses of most likely or best case/worst case, and they look a lot like what\u2019s out there in the public domain. We\u2019re going to end up issuing more term debt during the phase-in period, and we\u2019ll probably start in the relatively near term to leg into it so that we don\u2019t end up with an enormous overhang that has to be issued in a short amount of time. There\u2019s still a lot to know--oh, go ahead?", "John McDonald", "Oh no, sorry, I was going to say is it preferred as well? If you could just kind of weigh in on preferreds relative to where you think you might need to be.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yeah, well there\u2019s a little bit of preferred left to leg into our capital plan, but not much. And of course, there might be more if there\u2019s RWA growth and the whole capital stack expands pro rata. I think we\u2019re at 149 basis points of preferred today, and our target is 150, so we\u2019re pretty close there. But if we grow RWA, then there\u2019s an opportunity for more of that.", "The big job to do is going to be on the senior unsecured side, and so we need to know what the total quantum is as a result of where we end up in the 16 to 20 range as a base. We need to know what\u2019s included and excluded, and there\u2019s still things on that list that are being resolved both in the international and domestic standard. And then, we need to know the exact phase-in period, which we think we know.", "So when you look at those calculations with what we have maturing or otherwise running off, and then as I mentioned growth in RWA, that will lead us to what our annual issuance has to be to get there on time when the rule is final.", "John McDonald", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Ken Usdin", "Hi, good morning. John, I was wondering if you could provide any color to help us understand on the new loan purchases, is there any way to put in context either the yield of the portfolio relative to the existing yield of the Wells Fargo book, and do you bring over expenses with it or is it largely just interest income coming over, as has happened in your prior acquisitions of loan books?", "John Shrewsberry", "So the yield on the portfolio looks a lot like our commercial real estate portfolio today, because the loans look a lot like our commercial real estate loan portfolio today, and it\u2019s not coming over with material expense. I think we probably will have to add some small number of incremental people, but as you know, we\u2019re the largest commercial real estate lender in the U.S. today and we\u2019ve got a big, seasoned team all over the country that\u2019s close to borrowers and close to properties. That\u2019s the core team that will be managing the portfolio. If we\u2019re adding people, it\u2019s in the tens or maybe dozens of incremental professionals in order to help with asset management, but not a big number in the context of the size of the portfolio.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. Then as a follow-up, with regard to potential other portfolios that GE had talked about, given your positioning in terms of helping them through the structure, as you mentioned, do you guys get a different look or have you already taken a look at other parts of the book and this is just the first tranche of what could be more, or what\u2019s your general perception of the opportunity set that could come forth for Wells Fargo?", "John Stumpf", "They're a great customer, and we\u2019re trying to continue to help them and work together like we did here. They mentioned in their announcement that there is more to do, and we\u2019ll go through in any way that we can be helpful to them in ways that our good for our shareholders as well. So there is opportunity there - I can\u2019t really be specific about it because there are competitive processes at work, and this is their balance sheet, after all. But we will definitely be working closely together to see if there are other ways that we can help them.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. One follow-up on your credit comments. Understanding that energy is baked into this quarter and that you still net release reserves, can you just kind of give us the pushes and pulls within the credit buckets in terms of how much more improvement do you continue to see on the rest of the book, ex-the energy side, or have we really just kind of gotten to the end of the natural improvement?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, there is still meaningful improvement in first mortgage in particular. You\u2019ve seen charge-offs - they continue to come down, NPLs are down. The portfolio is performing very, very well, so as a result, there was room to take stock of what we think the issues are with the energy portfolio and end up with a net reserve release - a modest one, but a net reserve release. So it\u2019s quarter by quarter, we\u2019ll look at it at the end of the second quarter and see what the numbers tell us, but things do continue to improve.", "John Stumpf", "But Ken, I think we should also add that while there is still more improvement to be had on residential, on the other hand our commercial side has been close to or even in a recovery position. That won\u2019t last forever, so there is always pushes and pulls here, but overall credit is really, really doing well here. That\u2019s an industry phenomenon, but especially here at Wells.", "Ken Usdin", "Understood. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Please go ahead.", "Scott Siefers", "Morning guys. Just a couple of quick questions. So John, the tax rate has kind of bumped around, and this quarter obviously you had the discrete issue that you called out. What\u2019s the appropriate FTE tax rate to use going forward?", "John Shrewsberry", "The best way to think about the remainder of the year tax rate is to take the $359 million discrete tax benefit out of the first quarter and then recalculate the tax rate, which would get you to the mid-32s.", "Scott Siefers", "Yes, exactly. Okay, thank you. Then the other one - when you had been talking about the mobile growth, you had noted also that branch use has not been declining. From your perspective, who is coming in and what kind of stuff are they doing, and as you look at overall branch traffic and use and the need for branches, is it a good thing that people are still coming in, in that it makes for an easier, more direct cross-sell, or is it more of a negative in that you have to make mobile investments but you can\u2019t really leverage via fewer branches necessarily, or as much branch reduction as you might hope. How do you think about that dynamic?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, here\u2019s how we think about that. We start out with a customer, and customers tell us branches are important. We hear that every day, and while our other channels are growing - in fact, if you think about the 12,000 consumer interactions we have a minute in this company, 80% or so are what I would call digitally supported, either let\u2019s say online or mobile, and mobile being our fastest growing. But our stores, our 6,200 stores are still busy. Seventy-five percent of our customers come into a store once every six months, even millennials or our most advanced on the digital side visit our stores, visit ATMs. But 85% of our growth sales happen there, providing solutions, so it doesn\u2019t mean we have to build 5,000 or 6,000 square foot stores.", "As you probably know and we\u2019ve talked in the past, we\u2019ve tried some different concepts where we have 1,000 square foot stores that at night become an ATM vestibule and in the daytime the walls fold in and it becomes a full functioning, digitally-enabled store. We\u2019re doing that kind of thing, but our most loyal customer today is not necessarily the one who has the most products, it\u2019s the customer who does the most things with us, uses the most channels most often. So there is a--and we\u2019re increasingly becoming an information provider. We\u2019re in the information business as much as on the retail we\u2019re in the financial services business, so this is really about connecting all the channels, not about trying to drive customers into what\u2019s cheaper for us. That\u2019s not how we think about that. We think about what\u2019s best for them, and branches still remain an enormously important part in that.", "Scott Siefers", "Okay, that\u2019s good color. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joe Morford", "Good morning, guys. I guess first, compared to the fourth quarter the commercial loan growth was a little slower outside of real estate construction. Was some of that seasonal, or were there other factors in play there? And just in general, how do you feel about the current levels of demand on the commercial side?", "John Shrewsberry", "So the big Q4 to Q1 change is that we closed the sale of the student loan portfolio in Q4, which created a big C&I loan that happened toward the end of the quarter, so the step-up there was from a pretty elevated place. That has an impact in the calculation. I think in the first quarter, we feel good. Pipelines look pretty good. We\u2019ve talked to the leadership of the business and people are active, so from one quarter to the next, tough to tell. The year-over-year trend in C&I loans is really, really healthy, and then that step-up calculation is a little disadvantageous just to the math, but business is good.", "Joe Morford", "Okay. The other question was just curious what your early read is on the spring selling season this year, and are you starting to see any signs of a return of the first-time home buyer?", "John Stumpf", "Well Joe, since we\u2019re a big retail originator, that\u2019s obviously a big opportunity for us. Your question would suggest that the first-time home buyer had been a bit absent in this recovery compared to what it\u2019s been in previous recoveries, but I think some of the work that the industry did along with the GSCs in understanding put-back risk and transfer of risk makes credit a little bit more available. There is a little bit more activity going on, wage increases and increases in employment, that have been helpful. Affordability is really--you know, it\u2019s a good time to buy a home, so you never know. We\u2019re hopeful - we\u2019re going into the quarter with the highest pipeline - $44 billion - that we\u2019ve had in a couple years, so we\u2019re well positioned and we\u2019ll have to see what the numbers show, but we\u2019re running on faith here.", "Joe Morford", "Sounds good. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mike Mayo", "Hi, can you hear me?", "John Stumpf", "Yeah, hi Mike. Good morning.", "Mike Mayo", "Hey. Can you talk a little bit more in the housing backlog? How does it look by region, and what are the areas of strength?", "John Shrewsberry", "It\u2019s hard to say. It would be--the mortgage business that we\u2019re looking at right now, we\u2019re talking about national statistics. I guess obviously when we\u2019re talking about affordability and particularly for first-time home buyers or people who are most likely to benefit from the easing of the credit box that John just referred to, they probably would have the hardest time in the hottest markets, which - no surprise - are coastal markets and big cities, sitting here in San Francisco and many of you in New York. So things are more affordable in the middle of the country. That wouldn\u2019t come as any surprise. Most of what we\u2019re referring to is the national pipeline and statistics, and as far as I can tell, the production is pretty balanced from our various mortgage offices.", "John Stumpf", "Mike, just a couple things that you probably already know, as John mentioned, there are certain markets where the biggest challenge for housing is lack of inventory. Still, the entire Bay Area is a bid market where you bid for houses, you--I mean, my daughter and son-in-law bought a house recently. You have to write a letter and tell them how nice you are and how many children you have. A nice letter plus a lot of money will get you in the bidding process. That\u2019s not true, of course, everywhere, but I was in Miami recently and that market, it\u2019s stunning how that market is really doing so well. You would have looked back six years ago and you couldn\u2019t imagine what\u2019s going on today.", "So it just depends, and it\u2019s a bit about what\u2019s happening in those local economies. In the Bay Area, of course, what\u2019s happening in migration technology and so forth has really created a lot of activity here. So it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, but all in all, we\u2019re optimistic about the second quarter here.", "Mike Mayo", "Right, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Paul Miller", "Yes, thank you very much. You talk very positively about your mobile banking, your online banking, which I think everybody is having that same trend, but I know you\u2019ve opened a couple express branches, or whatever you want to call them, in the Washington DC area. How are they working out? Are you planning to expand those types of branches?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, we have--the first one there was NoMa - north of Massachusetts, and we had a second. Now we\u2019re doing a couple others in other markets, but I don\u2019t want to suggest for a minute that you\u2019ll see 6,200 NoMa\u2019s with 1,000 square feet across the franchise. I think it\u2019s a bit of everything, meaning that there is some hub and spoke where you have a larger established branch or store that\u2019s been there for many years, and then you have others around that maybe wouldn\u2019t be as large. You have some like the case in north of Massachusetts where you couldn\u2019t get 5,000 square feet, and 1,000 square feet is optimal for that market.", "So this is really about looking at our distribution, and what we call actually health of your distribution - are you in the right location with the right hours, the right people, the right footprint, and does the store or the branch work in concert with all the other channels of distribution so customers can start transactions one place, finish another place. Is there ubiquity, is there one version of the truth around information, and how customers serve themselves or want service from us.", "So it\u2019s a whole bunch of things that really matter in this, and I think the proof in the pudding is our ability to grow primary checking accounts. I\u2019ve never seen growth of 5.7%, and like John mentioned, it\u2019s not that we overpay on deposits - 9 basis points. I mean, this is the magic of how this thing all works together.", "Paul Miller", "And also over by NoMa, you also opened up one in a Safeway--I think it was a Safeway out there. I know a lot of people are moving away from supermarket banking. I don\u2019t think you are a big player in that area, but is that working out also?", "John Stumpf", "Yeah, at one time--this goes back a number of years. In 1998 when the former Norwest, the side of the family I came from, and Wells merged, Wells was hugely indexed - over-indexed to grocery stores. We\u2019ve been adjusting that since that time, but again we think of it density within a market, and sometimes to fill out that density it\u2019s a freestanding ATM machine, sometimes it\u2019s in-store, sometimes it\u2019s a NoMa 1,000 square foot, so it all fits into what we call the S-curve.", "Maybe I\u2019ll just digress for a second. If a community has, let\u2019s say, 500 banking locations, that\u2019s optimal for a community, and you have 20% of those - 100, and that\u2019s the optimal amount, you\u2019ll actually get more than 20% of the business. You\u2019ll get 25% of the business because certain competitors will have 10% of the stores and they\u2019ll get 8% of the business. So there is a magic to the density and where the density is and how it works together, and that\u2019s just part of our learnings after many, many years. So sometimes grocery stores fit into that, sometimes they don\u2019t. It surely would not be a lead-only strategy, but as an augment, it\u2019s very powerful.", "Paul Miller", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Bush", "Good morning, guys. How are you?", "John Stumpf", "Nancy, hi.", "Nancy Bush", "I have a question for you, John S - Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Yeah, there\u2019s two John S\u2019s around here!", "Nancy Bush", "John S. doesn\u2019t go anymore. There have been several articles recently, one a couple of days ago, I think maybe in the Wall Street Journal or somewhere, about the changing risk profile at Wells Fargo. They look at increased percentage of revenues coming from investment banking and assign a risk premium to that. Could you just address the whole issue, and just frame out for us how big you want investment banking and/or capital markets activities to be there?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, it\u2019s a good question. We think of customers--and Nancy, I\u2019ll get to the specific question, but the way we think about business here is around relationships, relationships with team members. My 11 direct reports have 28 years with the company. We think of relationships with our customers, our communities, our shareholders. Buffett\u2019s been an owner of ours for 25 years. We love long-term things, so as it gets to investment banking activities, we think of that as another solution, another product, another service. Most of the revenue that comes from that business is from existing customers who have been doing business for a long, long time. When you are the number one middle market bank, when you have leadership positions in energy and ag and commercial real estate, and you do business with 80-plus or 90% of the Fortune 500, you\u2019re going to get opportunities to serve customers deeply and broadly. If that means that through our skills and our people and our value proposition that customers, corporate customers want us to help them with valuation, issuing debt, issuing equity - wonderful. If we\u2019re not good enough to get that and they go someplace else, we just have to work harder.", "So I don\u2019t really look at lead tables. I guess I read where--in fact, I read for the first time when I read the Journal that we were number seven or eight or nine - I can\u2019t remember the number it was. I could have cared less, absolutely cared less. I only care that we do the right thing for customers, and if that means that we\u2019re moving up - terrific. If that means that others are growing faster because they\u2019re taking risks or doing things that don\u2019t make sense to us, God bless them. So that\u2019s how we think about it, not as a standalone business, as one more way to help customers succeed.", "Nancy Bush", "So I guess that\u2019s sort of it may or may not grow.", "John Stumpf", "Exactly. Just based on our skills and the market availability.", "John Shrewsberry", "Nancy, a couple of data points I\u2019d give you, just to help you dimension it. If you look at Wells Fargo compared to the peer group on the risks that we run, that we report in our 10-Qs and 10-K, we\u2019ve got a more modest set of trading businesses with a very low risk profile, at least as measured by VAR, which is the popular public version of that. Our investment banking fees, while we\u2019re thrilled and happy to have them, amount to a couple billion dollars a year, something like that, on a $90 billion revenue base. I think this quarter we were in the $420 million, $430 million range for trading revenue, which is appropriate for the needs that we have, for customer accommodation, and for managing our own risks. But still, in the scheme of a $1.7 trillion balance sheet, the equity that we carry, and $90 billion worth of revenue, it\u2019s just another one of or a couple of the 90-plus businesses that we refer to, and it\u2019s not imagined to grow in an outsized way from where it is today.", "We\u2019re always trying to do more, serve customers better. We have great people, but if we--imagine we doubled the size of the business over some period of time while the firm grew at it steady organic rate. We\u2019d still be in a relatively modest percentage of the overall firm.", "John Stumpf", "And Nancy, the risk really would be if you ever saw where the market is shrinking, let\u2019s say in investment banking or capital markets, and we\u2019re outsized growing because we\u2019re taking on risks with customer relationships that we had not known, that\u2019s where you see the imbalance. That\u2019s, again, just not who we are.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. Second question for John No. 2, in mortgage banking, if you could just repeat what you said about gain on sale. I was writing as fast as I could, but I missed the number. And where do you expect it to be in the second quarter?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, so the first quarter was at about 2%, a little more - 2.06%, which is the high end of the five-quarter range, and the second quarter is operating in that neighborhood, so we feel like we\u2019re going to be at the high end of the range in the second quarter as well.", "John Stumpf", "There\u2019s a lot more discipline this time around, Nancy, with gain on sale margins, as you well know because you\u2019ve seen this industry over a long time, so--and that\u2019s a healthy thing.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Morning. Just a follow-up on the mortgage competitive landscape here. It\u2019s interesting - we saw JP Morgan out earlier today with a big increase in correspondent originations versus a year ago. I think maybe you\u2019ve been a little more consistent in that business, so it\u2019s just some ebbs and flows. If you could just remind us on the correspondent and maybe talk about the mix that you\u2019re going after right now.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yeah, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a mix of going after as much as a mix of what\u2019s coming in. We\u2019ve been very consistent, as you said. What happens when rates pop down and refis spike up is that our own servicing portfolio results in a lot more applications because the easiest thing for somebody to do when they want to take advantage of a rate rally is call Wells Fargo, because we probably already have their mortgage. So that\u2019s going to have a bigger influence on a strategy that we might have around correspondent, and I think you can see in the supplement that retail was $28 billion and correspondent $20 billion of this quarter\u2019s activity. That\u2019s not an inconsistent blend versus the last several quarters.", "There are more correspondents these days, as you know, that go direct to the agencies because the agencies have opened the window to them, and that\u2019s also a lower margin business for us, so all things being equal, we\u2019re happy to be a retail lender but we do serve a big correspondent constituency.", "John Stumpf", "And Matt, if you go back in time, we actually had a larger share of the correspondent because there was a number of competitors who backed away, walked away from that market, who come and go from time to time. So that will ebb and flow as participants either stay in or get out, or whatever.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Then to circle back on expenses, I guess I\u2019m focused on, call it the people cost - the salaries, commissions, incentive comp, employee benefits. If you sum those three lines, it's up, I think, 6, 7% versus a year ago. I know there\u2019s the trading nuance that we need to adjust for, but is there some impact of the mortgage pipeline impact on those numbers as you staff up in anticipation of higher volume? I\u2019m trying to reconcile why that growth might be so much versus revenue in some of the categories in fees.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, I wouldn\u2019t look towards mortgage. I would look towards risk management and investments that we\u2019re making along those lines. The beauty about mortgage in the first quarter was that this refi pipeline helps use the capacity that we would have needed in the fourth quarter and we anticipate needing in the second quarter, so it was a greater level of utilization. For better or for worse, the changes in year-over-year are a variety of other things, including business mix, by the way, in terms of how commissions get paid and other revenue-related incentives. But it would be that plus investments made in compliance and risk management, cyber and information security, things like that. Those are--we have the best people and those are not inexpensive.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Any way to size that, either on an absolute basis or versus, say, a year ago, just that overall bucket of, call it non-revenue related cost?", "John Shrewsberry", "I don\u2019t have an accurate number. I think we\u2019ve talked about $100 million a quarter, a couple quarters ago as having been an observable increase in that category, and it\u2019s not any lower than that today. Maybe we\u2019ll see if next time around we can put a finer point on that.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Okay. All right, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Again, that is star, one for any questions. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Thanks very much. John, just to follow up on your energy-related comments, and I appreciate the detail you provided, but can you just clarify - was there in fact any increase in general or specific reserves for that portfolio or any downward migration in internal risk ratings, or anything of that nature?", "John Shrewsberry", "There was a little bit of downward migration, not enough to meaningfully drive the reserve. There was a little bit of an increase in NPAs, but negligible, and we realized minimal losses in the quarter in the energy portfolio.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Okay.", "John Shrewsberry", "But the change in reserve reflects all of the actual migration, the actual observation of performance in the energy portfolio.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Understood. One of the other institutions indicated that based on the forward price curve, they would expect some of the pressure on the E&P sector [indiscernible].", "John Shrewsberry", "I\u2019d have to say yes. I mean, we\u2019re in the middle of our spring redetermination process for the borrowing base loans, so we\u2019ll have a better feeling afterwards. We have noticed a lot of capital raising going on in the space. We talked last quarter about the risk to our investment banking income around energy-related firms, because we\u2019re large in that space, and we had a great first quarter in energy investment banking because lots of equity was raised, lots of firms went to the debt market to turn themselves out. So that\u2019s a very positive sign - there\u2019s people taking steps and changing their balance sheets and improving their risk profile, so that and the combination of where the forward curve demonstrates that energy prices might be going is helpful. But again, that\u2019s reflected in our early view of our allowance and it will be better informed once we finish our borrowing base redeterminations.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "And typically when is that?", "John Shrewsberry", "During this quarter.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.", "Marty Mosby", "Thank you. I want to drill into the mortgage banking a little bit more, in that when we managed ours and we had this recognition of origination at close and not interest rate locked, whenever prepayments kicked in, servicing income was compressed as you had to write down the servicing for the expected prepayments, but origination income wasn\u2019t at its full run with refi. So in my mind, I was just trying to look at this first quarter as kind of the launching pad going into much stronger, and not to quantify that, but just a stronger return of revenues on mortgage from that timing effect.", "John Shrewsberry", "Actually, I think that\u2019s a pretty astute observation, because we would be valuing the MSR on prepayment expectations, which reflect that lower interest rate, and we haven\u2019t taken the gain on the pipeline and what\u2019s locked and slated to close in the second quarter.", "Marty Mosby", "Two follow-ups to that thought process. Seventy-one basis points on the servicing portfolio has to be close to an all-time low. Are we getting to the point that even with prepayments, we wouldn\u2019t need much more revaluation given you\u2019ve already incorporated a lot of the expected prepayments into the current valuation?", "John Shrewsberry", "It\u2019s a good observation, but it\u2019s tough to say. We look at that calculation regularly, but in connection with our preparation of our financial statements on a quarterly basis, and take everything into account that\u2019s available then, and that\u2019s when we strike the value.", "Marty Mosby", "Then lastly when you convert your unclosed pipeline of $44 billion into what would be a normal pull-through into originations in the next quarter, I get to something like $75 billion to $80 billion. Does that seem about right in the sense that that\u2019s the kind of run rate you\u2019re getting into at this point?", "John Shrewsberry", "Tough to know. We don\u2019t know what hasn\u2019t happened yet, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to--the applications that will be received and pulled through in the quarter, so too early to speculate.", "Marty Mosby", "The good thing is that half of it is already done in the unclosed pipeline, so you at least know that part.", "John Shrewsberry", "That\u2019s right.", "Marty Mosby", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "Thanks for taking my questions. A quick question on the margin. I wanted to get some color on the 13 basis point decline in commercial loan yields. I know you indicated that was partly impacted by fees. Did lower loan fees account for all of that, or how much of it was downward pressure on yields from pricing pressure?", "John Shrewsberry", "It\u2019s more PCI loan recoveries and lower loan fees than competitive pricing pressure. Those things that we call the variable components of interest income are harder to predict, and when a loan gets resolved that\u2019s been sitting in workout, sometime it comes through the margin line, and then if a loan prepays or there is loan fee hung up in its carrying value, then that sometimes comes through interest income as well. It\u2019s those types of items that are tough to plan for, tough to budget, and in this particular quarter were lower than in prior quarters.", "John Pancari", "Okay, and then how does that play into your margin outlook? Is it fair to assume still mid-single digit basis point compression per quarter as we move through \u201915?", "John Shrewsberry", "It\u2019s too tough to call, because it depends on what happens with deposit growth, it depends on what happens with loan growth, and then other investments that we make in the securities portfolio. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive it. It\u2019s led by what happens to deposit growth, and of course if there were a move in interest rates, that would have an impact as well. We\u2019re not trying to forecast it in this instance.", "John Pancari", "Okay, all right.", "John Stumpf", "Yeah, our real focus is on generating growth in net interest income, and the margin is more the result, not the reason.", "John Pancari", "Right, okay. Then on that front, John, if you could just talk a little bit about loan growth expectations. I know you gave some good color on what you\u2019re seeing on C&I, but CRE, you saw still declines in your total CRE book. I want to get some thoughts around a sustained inflection in that portfolio organically, and then is it also fair to assume that the loan growth overall should remain in the mid-single digit range at this point?", "John Shrewsberry", "Tough to call, because it depends on the mix. We\u2019ve got a variety of commercial and consumer asset types here that each have their own market and cyclical dynamics. I think we expect cards were probably at a seasonal low in the first quarter, so between seasonality and issuing new cards, that business probably grows. Auto, we\u2019ve kept--it\u2019s grown but kept relatively stable. It\u2019s gotten to be a more competitive market, and we\u2019ve picked our spots, I think, a little bit more delicately. In commercial real estate, it\u2019s going to be tough to spot the organic component of it because the purchase of the GE portfolio and this incremental loan to Blackstone Mortgage Trust is going to have a big impact in the second and third quarters.", "But if I\u2019d add anything to that, it\u2019s that now the competitive dynamic in commercial real estate lending is a little bit different because a big competition is exiting the business. That probably means something for us organically, if that\u2019s helpful.", "John Pancari", "Okay, thank you. My last question is just on the credit side. The oil and gas reserve post what you did this quarter, can you quantify where that reserve stands right now?", "John Shrewsberry", "You know, we don\u2019t call it out specifically. We capture the whole portfolio in our overall allowance for loan losses and feel that that is absolutely adequate for the loan book that we have, which incidentally has never been better overall. Oil and gas loans are approximately 2% of the total portfolio.", "John Pancari", "Right. Okay, thanks again for taking my questions.", "John Stumpf", "Okay, this concludes our call, so thanks. I especially want to thank you to all 265,000 team members for a very, very good first quarter, and thanks for all of you on the line. We will see you next quarter. Bye bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings; including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim. And thank you, good morning and thanks for joining us today. We earned $5.8 billion in the third quarter, as our diversified business model generated growth in revenue, loans, deposits and net income compared with a year ago. We remain focussed on meeting the financial needs of our customers and are investing in businesses so we may continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers in the future. The strength of our franchise also positioned us well for the acquisitions we have recently announced. We are excited that the transactions with GE Capital will enable us to deepen relationships and increase our presence in commercial businesses that serve the real economy.", "General Electric, like Wells Fargo is one of America\u2019s great companies and the businesses we are acquiring are industry leaders with proven business models and exceptionally talented and experienced people. We are excited to have them join the Wells Fargo team. John Shrewsberry will provide more details on the recent GE Capital announcements at the end of the call.", "Let me now highlight our results this quarter compared with the year ago. We earned $1.05 in earnings per share, up 3% from a year ago. We generated $21.9 billion of revenue, up 3% with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. We grew pre-tax, pre provision profit by 6%.", "We continue to have broad based loan growth with total loans reaching a record $903.2 billion. This is a bit larger than the size of our loan portfolio at the time of the Wachovia merger at the end of 2008. However, the quality of our current portfolio is significantly better than at the time of the merger.", "Our core loan portfolio increased by $73.4 billion, or 9% from a year ago reflecting both strong organic growth and the benefit of the acquisitions we have completed over the past year. Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with total deposits reaching a record $1.2 trillion up $71.6 billion or 6% from a year ago and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.8%.", "Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation and returning capital to our shareholders remains our priority. Our dividend payout ratio is 35% and we repurchased 52 million shares of common stock in the third quarter.", "Turning to the economic environment, the global economy showed some signs of weakness in the third quarter, primarily in China and other emerging markets. This weakness impacted the financial markets and the rising value of the U.S. dollar has caused the trade deficit to widen.", "As you know, Wells Fargo is a U.S. centric company and the U.S. economy while not immune to these developments has proven quite resilient. The low energy prices that are negatively impacting certain aspects of the economy have provided a welcome boost to consumers with many now beginning to redirect their savings into purchasing goods and services.", "As an example, new auto sales were at their highest levels in a decade. Housing continued to rebound with home sales at their highest level since 2009 and a limited supply of homes of new homes are driving new home constructions and while the latest jobs report was disappointing relative to expectations the labor market continue to show steady gains with September posting the 60th consecutive month of rising employment something never before accomplished and the unemployment rate is at a level that many consider to be the long term norm.", "As the U.S. and the world economies evolve, Well Fargo remains focussed on the building blocks of our growth. Increasing the number of household reserve, adding commercial relationships, deepening consumer and commercial relationships and growing loans and deposits, this focus will benefit our long term growth while we continue to meet our customers financial needs and navigate the challenges of today\u2019s economy.", "John Shrewsberry, our CFO will now provide more details on our third quarter results. John?", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you, John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions.", "Our third quarter results demonstrated consistent financial performance and momentum across a variety of key business drivers. We continued to have strong loan and deposit growth across our diversified commercial and consumer businesses. We grew revenue by generating growth in net interest income and non-interest income. We produced positive operating leverage as our expenses declined.", "Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of only 31 basis points of average loans and we operated within our targeted ranges for ROA, ROE, efficiency and net payout ratio. Let me now highlight these key drivers in more detail.", "On page three, we showed the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted including revenue, pre-tax, pre provision profit, loans, deposits, net income and EPS and we reduced our common shares outstanding by 106.5 million shares over the past year.", "Turning to page four, we continued to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet which has positioned us well to take advantage of growth opportunities including our recently announced acquisitions. We grew total assets by 7% from a year ago and 2% from second quarter with growth in loans, short term investments and investment securities. Our funding sources increased with continued deposit growth and increased long term debt and short term borrowings.", "Turning to the income statement overview on page five, revenue increased $557 million from the second quarter with growth in net interest and non-interest income and we generated positive operating leverage as expenses declined.", "As shown on page six, we had strong broad based loan growth in the third quarter, our 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core loan portfolio grew by $73.4 billion or 9% from a year ago and was up $17.1 billion from the second quarter. Commercial loans grew $9.4 billion and consumer loans grew $7.7 billion from the second quarter.", "Our total loan portfolio is balanced between commercial and consumer loans with commercial loans now 50% of our portfolio. Our portfolio has become more balanced as we have experienced run off in our liquidating consumer portfolios and have growth our commercial portfolios through organic growth and acquisition.", "On page seven, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $38 billion or 15% from a year ago, the growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double digit year-over-year growth and asset backed finance, corporate banking, commercial real estate, structured real estate and government and institutional banking. Commercial real estate loans grew $12.8 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter of GE Capital transaction and organic growth.", "Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $15.3 billion or 7% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality non-conforming mortgages. Credit card balances were up $4 billion or 14% from a year ago benefitting from strong new account growth, more active accounts and the Dillard\u2019s portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Auto loans were up $3.9 billion or 7% from last year. We had record new originations in the third quarter up 10% from a year ago reflecting the strong auto market while we have remained disciplined in our approach.", "As highlighted on page eight, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter up $71.8 billion from a year ago and up $13.6 billion from the second quarter. This growth was broad based across our commercial and consumer businesses. Our average deposit cost was 8 basis points down 2 basis points from a year ago and stable with the second quarter. We continued to successfully grow our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5.8% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5%.", "Page nine highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. Our earning asset mix results and diversified sources of interest income and the drivers of fee generation are diverse also. We had strong equity gains in the third quarter comprising 9% of our fee income up from 5% last quarter and 7% a year ago. Our total market sensitive revenue which includes trading and gains from debt and equity investments increased $210 million from second quarter but was down slightly from a year ago.", "We grew net interest income $516 million or 5% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in loans and securities and by adding duration to the balance sheet. The $187 million increase in net interest income from the second quarter reflected growth in investments and loans including the benefit from the GE Capital loan purchase and financing transaction related to commercial real estate assets that settled late in the second quarter.", "Net interest income also reflected one additional day in the quarter accounting for about one third of the increase from the second quarter. These benefits were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources including purchased credit impaired loan recoveries, periodic dividends and loan fees.", "The net interest margin declined 1 basis points from the second quarter. The decline was due to customer driven deposit growth which reduced the margin by 3 basis points, but had minimal impact to net interest income. Lower income from variable sources also reduced the margin by 3 basis points, these decreases were partially offset by balance sheet growth and repricing driven by security purchases and higher loan balances which benefited the margin by 5 basis points.", "As I have discussed previously our view on interest rates has evolved over the past year to be more of a lower for longer expectation for both short term and long term rates. As a result, we\u2019ve been adding duration to our balance sheet, however our balance sheet remains asset sensitive and we are positioned to benefit from higher rates and we expect to be able to grow net interest income over the long term even if the rate environment continues to be challenging.", "Total non-interest income increased $370 million from second quarter, driven by higher equity gains, other income, deposit service charges and card fees. Gains from equity investments were up $403 million from the second quarter reflecting strong results from venture capital, private equity and other investments. We recognized gains on more than 10 different holdings demonstrating the diversity of our equity portfolio and our long term commitment to this business.", "Non-controlling interest reduced the impact of the equity gains through our net income and increased $120 million from the second quarter. The other non-interest income category was up $406 million in the third quarter driven by the impact of lower interest rates on our long term, our long term debt hedges.", "As a reminder, we required from an accounting perspective to measure the hedge effectiveness at the end of each quarter and while the net impact is generally expected to be zero over the life an instrument, interest rate and currency volatility can cause this line item to vary from quarter to quarter.", "Other income also increased from higher income on our equity method investments as well as the gain on our sale of warranty solutions which happened in the third quarter.", "Mortgage banking revenue declined $116 million from the second quarter. Origination volume of $55 billion was down 11% from the second quarter reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 15% from a year ago benefitting from a stronger housing market. 66% of originations were for purchases in the third quarter up from 54% in the second quarter.", "We ended the quarter with a $34 billion application pipeline down 11% from the second quarter but up 36% from a year earlier. Based on the current rate environment, the level of our pipeline and the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market we currently expect originations in the fourth quarter to be lower than the third quarter.", "Our production margin on residential held for sale mortgage originations was 188 basis points in the third quarter. This ratio has been refined from how it was determined in prior quarters in an effort to provide investors with better information on a residential originate and sell business. Based on our updated approach, we currently expect our production margin in the fourth quarter to remain within the range of the past five quarters at 170 basis points to 195 basis points.", "As shown on page 12, expenses were down $70 million from the second quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower employee benefits from reduced deferred compensation expense which was largely offset in trading, expenses also benefited from lower advertising expense and reduced insurance expense reflecting seasonally lower, premium driven compensation costs in crop insurance.", "We also made a $126 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation which increased other non-interest expense. Operating losses were stable from the second quarter but they remained higher than the five quarter average as we continued to have elevated litigation accruals for various legal matters.", "We continued to invest in our businesses with particular focus on risk, cyber and technology projects. These investments partially reflected in higher outside professional services expense in the quarter. Our efficiency ratio improved to 56.7% in the third quarter. We are focussed on managing expenses, partially reflected in the 27% reduction in travel and entertainment expense from a year ago as we reduced non-customer facing travel, however we expect to operate at the higher end of our target efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2015 and until our revenue benefits from higher rates we expect to remain at the upper end of that range.", "Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.7 billion in the third quarter, up 7% from a year ago and up 10% from second quarter. One of the drivers of our long-term growth is our ability to attract new households to Wells Fargo.", "Year-to-date through August, we\u2019ve had the strongest new retail bank household growth in four years, and during the third quarter we announced an initiative that makes the experience of opening an account easier for the millions of consumers which used to bank with us.", "Our new and existing customers are increasingly using our digital offerings with active online customers up 8% and active mobile customers up 17% from a year ago. We are growing our credit and debit card businesses through new customer growth and increased usage among existing customers. Credit card purchase volume was $18 million up 15% from a year ago and debit card purchase volume was $71 million up 8% from a year ago.", "Our Wells Brokerage and Retirement segment has been renamed Wealth and Investment management, reflecting the realignment of our asset management business from wholesale banking into wealth and investment management. We also moved our reinsurance business from wealth and investment management and our strategic auto investments from community banking into wholesale banking. These changes are part of our regular course of business. We are always looking for ways to better align our businesses, deepen existing customer relationships and create a best-in-class structure to benefit both our customers and our shareholders. For comparative purposes prior period segment results have been revised to reflect these changes.", "Despite a challenging equity market environment, wealth and investment management earned $606 million in the third quarter up 10% from a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter. These results reflect a strong balance sheet growth and net interest income growing 18% from a year ago.", "Average core deposits grew 6% from a year ago and loans grew 16% in the ninth consecutive quarter of double digit year-over-year growth. Loan growth was driven by an increase in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans and security based lending.", "Retail brokerage and managed account assets were flat from a year ago and down 6% from second quarter, the length quarter declined reflected the weak equity markets. As a reminder, managed account asset fees are priced at the beginning of the quarter so fourth quarter fees will reflect the weaker September 30th market valuations.", "Wholesale banking earned $1.8 billion in the third quarter, down 8% from a year ago and 13% from second quarter. The length quarter decline was driven by lower non-interest income primarily as a result of lower equity investment gains and reduced sales in trading and investment banking activity reflecting market volatility.", "Balance sheet growth remained strong with average loan growth of 15% from a year ago. This growth benefited from the GE Capital loan purchase related to commercial real estate assets that closed last quarter and also reflected broad based growth across most wholesale businesses. Average core deposits grew 12% from a year ago. Treasury management revenue continued to grow up 9% from a year ago driven by new sales of treasury management solutions.", "Turning to Page 16, credit quality remained strong in the third quarter. Our net charge-off rate was 31 basis points of average loans, up slightly from second quarter primarily from seasonally higher auto losses.", "Non-performing assets have declined for 12 consecutive quarters and were down $1.1 billion from the second quarter. This improvement was broad based driven by improvements in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios.", "We did not have a reserve release in the third quarter; the first quarter was no reserve release since the first quarter of 2010. While we continue to benefit from improvements in the performance of our residential real estate portfolio we also increased commercial reserves reflecting deterioration in the energy sector. As a reminder, only 2% of our total loans outstanding are in the oil and gas sector and we continue to work proactively with our customers as we manage through the current industry cycle.", "We've started the fall redeterminations and reserve-based energy loans are performing as expected. We believe the energy services sector will incur greater challenges in the near term as it adjusts to lower commodity prices and this view was reflected in our reserving process.", "We\u2019re also monitoring all loan types in MSAs where greater than 3% of employment is directly tied to oil production. To date, while we have not experienced measurable differences in the portfolio of performance between oil and non-oil communities, overtime we would expect some co-related stress in communities that are dependant on oil and gas.", "Future allowance levels whether they are higher or lower will be driven by a variety of factors including loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions.", "Turning to Page 17, our capital level remains strong with our estimated common equity tier-1 ratio under Basel-3 fully phased in at 10.7% in the third quarter. We returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and net share repurchases and our net payout ratio was 60%.", "In summary, our third quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong growth in loans and deposits and revenue growth reflecting higher net interest and higher non-interest income.", "Our returns are among the best in the industry with an ROA of 132 basis points and an ROE of 12.62%. Our strong liquidity and capital positions us well to serve our existing customers while growing our customer base organically and through acquisitions.", "Let me conclude by highlighting the transactions we\u2019ve announced over the past couple of weeks. We summarized these announcements starting on slide 20. As John mentioned earlier, operating from a position of strength allows us to make quality acquisitions that help us serve more markets and meet more of our customer\u2019s financial needs. In connection with these transactions, we\u2019ve maintained our long standing discipline due diligence process and our strong capital position provides us with the capacity to acquire these businesses and assets.", "I\u2019ll start by highlighting the largest transaction which involves approximately $32 billion of assets. Yesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire GE Capital\u2019s commercial distribution, finance and vendor finance businesses as well as certain corporate finance loan and lease assets. Over 600 Wells Fargo team members were involved in the evaluation and due diligence which occurred over the past few months. This agreement provides us with a unique opportunity to add relationships and earning assets in businesses where GE Capital was an unequivocal market leader and where we either have meaningful experience or in the case of commercial distribution finance is a strong compliment to our existing capabilities.", "These businesses have established in deep relationships with their customers and we are excited about the opportunity to enhance these relationships with the breadth of our product offerings. These businesses are run by experienced teams with average tenures of over 20 years. We will also benefit from the acquisition of GE Capital state of the art customer facing systems that will create efficiencies. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016 with minimal impact on our liquidity position.", "Over the medium to long term, we plan to fund the acquisition with anticipated growth and deposits and in the short term we will likely have to increase our borrowings to preserve our liquidity position.", "Similar to the GE Capital transaction related to commercial real estate assets that closed in the second quarter, the loans releases roughly 90% based in U.S. and Canada will be recorded a fair value inclusive of a life time credit loss at close, including transition cost related to integrating these businesses we expect this acquisition to be neutral to modestly accretive to our 2016 results.", "At the end of September, we also announced an agreement to acquire GE railcar services, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. This transaction involves 77,000 railcars and just over 1000 locomotives as well as associated operating at long term leases that will be added to our existing First Union Rail business, making us the second largest railcar and locomotive leasing company in North America.", "Similar to GE Capital transaction that they completed earlier this year, we were able to find a partner, in this case, a Berkshire Hathaway Company, to agree to acquire the assets that did not align well with our business strategy. This acquisition will add to the quality and diversification of our existing fleet and add to our capacity to meet the industries growing demand for railcars.", "Just to summarize the timing related to our GE transactions, our results this quarter include the impact from the GE Capital transaction related to commercial real estate assets that closed in the second quarter and we expect to close in the first quarter of 2016 the GE railcar transaction and the GE Capital transactions we announced yesterday.", "John and I will now be happy to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joe Morford", "Thanks. Good afternoon everyone -- good morning, everyone. Still too early.", "John Stumpf", "Hi, Joe, good morning.", "Joe Morford", "Just -- I guess following up first on the last comments about the GE Capital acquisitions, just I guess curious to learn a little bit more about fit with the existing platform that you have where some of the synergies are. And then, any color you may be able to share in terms of the profitability of these businesses or the relative yields. I guess I was a little surprised you're saying maybe only modest earnings accretion. Is that due to some of the expenses you're bringing on with their staff and/or the higher near-term borrowing costs?", "John Stumpf", "So with respect to the first part of your question, Joe the businesses line up well as we said the commercial distribution finance business is an asset based lending business that operates between OEMs on the one hand and the distributors on the other. It will fit in Well Fargo alongside what we describe as Well Fargo Capital Finance, our ABL business. The GE team has leadership and speciality in their version of ABL lending but of course we\u2019ve got the team that\u2019s been together for 20 plus years in ABL and this will complement them nicely. And as we mentioned the technology that they used to run their business is also something that we think we can benefit from in our broader business overtime.", "The vendor finance business aligns well with our equipment finance business. Our equipment finance business tends to focus on the users of equipment, their equipment finance business has big relationships with OEMs who are selling equipment and so we think that they are very complimentary when put together.", "With respect to the question about 2016 accretion, we think there will be plenty of expenses in order -- people expenses, technology integration expenses, premises expenses perhaps another thing. So we're focused on doing that integration the right way. It's going to take some time. We're going to be very thoughtful about it. And we're more focused on the medium to long term impact than what this means in 2016.", "John Shrewsberry", "Joe, I've been around the acquisition game for a long time and what we typical have said in the past and this is probably truer with the depository that we look for accretion by year three. It will happen sooner in this case, because its not as complex, but we have learned that to do these things well you practice on yourself not on your customers. You get everything done right and we really look at this as John mentioned, as a long-term value-add to the company. So things that closed in the first quarter you bound to have expenses around integration to get this really done right.", "John Stumpf", "Actually Joe, you also asked about funding. And that is part of the equation here. We will be term funding components of this, so it's not as easy as absorbing existing cash. I think some of the early analyst reports have reflected that belief. So, we'll be layering in some term funding in advance of the assets coming on. Then we'll have some incremental costs et cetera and we're trying to maintain our liquidity buffers through and after the addition of these assets. So, makes it a little bit more complicated than some of the math that I've seen so far.", "Joe Morford", "Okay. That's all really helpful. I appreciate that color. I guess the other question was just I recognize the equity investment gains this quarter really came from a number of different investments. But any color on maybe what's a good run rate there or just maybe market sensitive revenues overall, recognizing they were down a couple hundred million this quarter?", "John Shrewsberry", "In both cases I would look at something like a five-quarter average of equity gains on its own and then equity gains, gains on debt and trading activities as well. I think they're probably more representative of a run rate.", "Joe Morford", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "John Shrewsberry", "You're welcome, Joe.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks for taking my questions. You talked about the expenses being elevated with legal, and last quarter there was about a $225 million increase. Is that still the same number that's kind of embedded in the overall operating expenses this quarter?", "John Shrewsberry", "Marty, there is going to be a run rate of what we had last quarter, where we are this quarter probably for a period of time. I mean, each individual legal matter is its own thing and we can't comment on litigation. But I would think of them as part of the environment that we're in and operating losses in total are probably going to remain about where they are. If they begin to come back down, that would be great. But I wouldn't consider this to be outsized at, call it, $500 million for the quarter for total operating losses.", "Marty Mosby", "The other thing is that you look at wholesale banking, that's where you see some of the pressures that we have seen in other banks with capital markets activities. You had the reduction in the fee income but not much reduction in expenses. You talked about compensation expenses going lower but were offset by losses. Can you break those two things out so we can get a feel for the two components in the expense line?", "John Shrewsberry", "So I would expect the expenses that are directly related to revenue to generally, especially over the course of the year to reflect their production of revenue might not be as linear from quarter to quarter as revenue moves up or down. And that's been true for some time. We have operating losses like a legal settlement for example, that will temporarily elevate expenses in that business unit at the firm while they may remain elevated, they don't necessarily remain elevated in wholesale banking or in any individual segment.", "So I wouldn't expect for example, compensation expenses cycle for the firm as a whole or for the division as a whole as a result of a one time in an operating loss. But all told, I would say that we pay for performance in that group. Our total approach to performance based comp seems to hold very well with the revenue sources that we have and the operating and the results of the segment make sense to the cycle or frankly for any full year.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks. Any further duration extension on the assets structure given the outlook that rates will stay lower for longer? I appreciate.", "John Shrewsberry", "Not much. You can see that we added a few billion dollars of net securities to our investment portfolio. We like where we are from an asset sensitivity standpoint today. We're going to be adding these incremental assets that we talked about in connection with the GE portfolio, some of which are leases, so you think of them as a little bit longer term and fixed rate which will have the same impact as adding securities. So, we've slowed down a little bit in adding duration in the third quarter compared to the second quarter which I think you can see in the deck and we still have conviction that we're probably in a lower for longer rate scenario.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mike Mayo", "I just wanted to follow-up on that last comment. You believe you're in a lower for longer rate environment. Do you think the U.S. economy is getting better or worse, I guess, I'm hearing on the one hand John you're mentioning some additional confidence in some areas. On the other hand you mentioned global economy is being the headwind, so which is it? Is the U.S. economy getting better or worse?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, Mike, it\u2019s a good question. I think \u2013 we think it's getting better, but only incrementally better. So, as we \u2013 none of us know of course, but this year the GDP in the U.S. let's call it 2/1 maybe 2/2, maybe next year as maybe 2/5 something like that, 2/4 to 2/5, so better but not substantially better. You know us well, so you know that most of our business is U.S. centric, but clearly some of our businesses that we support and do business with have a international component to them, either sales or whatever the case is and the rest of the world, the biggest risk I think the U.S. economy is what's happening in the rest of the world, I think that's unquestionable. So \u2013 but better but not hugely better.", "John Shrewsberry", "With respect to rates lower for longer applies. We think of it is at the short end and the medium to long end of the curve and so the Fed starts moving rates in December or in the first quarter, we will be sitting here a year from now we think with one, two or three, 25 basis point moves under our belt at probably best case with respect to how far things might move. And unless there's meaningful inflation which isn't anybody's radar screen right, than it doesn't feel like that's going to have an impact on long terms rates, it feels like more of a flatter curve environment and long rates in the vicinity of where they are now and what something really different begins to emerge.", "And of course like good news is for round about our forecast we performed better. We're constructing ourselves to do well in this environment. But if we end up in a higher short term or higher long-term rate environment than we're forecasting that's actually, that's not good for Wells Forgo.", "Mike Mayo", "With that expectation are you taking the second look at expenses, I mean, your efficiency ratio this quarter moved in a better range, but do you have a plan B to say, we expect these headwinds to last for longer, therefore we're going to do something extra?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. I describe it as a full time plan B, which is they were always looking a way to be more efficient. We highlighted a couple of them over the last few quarters. We took a hard look at T&E a year ago. We're down 25% year-over-year. We've talked about our real estate strategy we where shrunk by 20 million square feet over the last few years and still have more to go. As there are varieties of programs like that, but most of that savings gets absorbed by areas where we're changing or improving the firm. We're spending money on compliance, on risk management, on technology, on innovation. So I've got some conviction that we're not going to move below the higher end of our range, while we're still in this lower rate environment because whatever savings we get by being thrifty we end up reinvesting into the programs that I mentioned.", "John Stumpf", "Yes. Just to put an emphasizes on that Mike, expenses get a lot of discussion around here and we are keenly focus on them, because as John mentioned he saved \u2013 and we think of it in ways of what will the customer pay for and what makes us a stronger long term provider of services to our customers and to be a more relevant company to all our constituents. And you save in one side and you invest on the other side. And some of those investments have been fairly significant. But it\u2019s a constant drumbeat around here.", "Mike Mayo", "All right. Thank you.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Erika Najarian", "Yes, good morning. Just to follow-up on Joe's question. John, could you give us a sense of what the average yield of the 32 billion in GE assets that you're putting on and what the fee income generation was for last year?", "John Shrewsberry", "No. Just because we haven't disclosed the yields on that portfolio, but I can tell you Erika, it looks a lot like our \u2013 like that portion of our own wholesale portfolio and I would add frankly that their approach to risk analysis of their loans looks like our risk analysis of their loans and their pricing on those loans looks like our pricing of similar loans. So, you should think of it as a component piece of what our wholesale banking outcomes look like. And in fee generation, is the question was GE generated in fees with those loans or what\u2026", "Erika Najarian", "Yes. Or is that business that you're acquiring generated in fees?", "John Shrewsberry", "So, the revenue streams of that business are more net interest income streams rather than fee streams. I mean, there are certainly loan fees but they get amortized into yield. I can tell you in our own analysis of this and I'm sure in yours also, as we look out over some period of time we can imagine a lot of other products and services that we'll be providing to the same customers that GE wasn't in a position to offer them directly, so its part of the long-term value creation, but there's isn't a run rate that in there today, because GE was a primarily a lender rather than a full service provider of banking capabilities.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. And just wanted to get some clarification on your comments earlier because adding these assets have the same impact of extending duration on the asset side, should we expect cash balances to stay relatively stable from the average balances of the third quarter?", "John Shrewsberry", "It depends on what's happening with deposit growth over the timeframe that we're talking about. This is five or six months in the future, so all things seeing equal, but maybe you could say us and by cash \u2013 cash and HQLA are high quality liquid assets are interchangeable in some ways, so I would look at the some of those things, not just cash depending on how our rate view evolves and what goes on in terms of the opportunity to get more invested et cetera. These are risk assets, that's one sort of use of cash, cash at the fed or cash in treasuries are two other related uses of cash so, I don't want to over complicated, but it\u2019s a little bit different than just the cash balance.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. And just to sneak one last one in. Your results clearly demonstrates your strength on your relationship for the consumer in the corporate side. Given your balance sheet and capital strength and some difficult headlines that we are seeing from European bank, how are you thinking in terms of your medium-term strategy to increase your market share with institutional clients, given potential market shared dislocation and your strength in capital, particularly in leverage capital?", "John Shrewsberry", "I wouldn't think of our medium term strategy any differentially than how you've seen us behave in the recent past in that area. We have great relationships with our large number of institutional clients and counterparties and there are something interesting things to do, but we've got high regard for our capital on our funding and real meaningful expectations for how we get paid for using it as we work on those relationship. So we're already doing that from time to time something interesting will reveal itself and we'll consider it, but there is no change in strategy that it\u2019s going to result in us having a different risk profile or trying to fill our major vacuum that maybe being left behind by European bank or something else over the next few years.", "John Stumpf", "Yes. What you would liked about us in the past you like about us in the future regarding that.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Thanks and good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Hi, Eric.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Hi. How are you? I just want to make sure that I'm fully understanding kind of what the key points of leverage are in the income statement as we look out into next year. Obviously it seems like the biggest contributor as a revenue driver is asset growth stemming in part from these acquisitions, but given sort of NIM commentary and the efficiency ratio commentary, should we expect positive operating leverage into next year or more basically zero?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, we are always striving to generate positive operating leverage, so that's a goal as we set out to plan for the coming period. In terms of what happens it will be \u2013 it will reflect what we're primarily emphasizing which is the growth in relationships which leads to a growth in loans and a growth in deposit, credit discipline and further penetration on all in our product areas with the customers that we have. Other macro events sit on top of that with respect to where rates go et cetera, tough to know. And we're not as focused on that or can't be as focused on that, because we can't control some of those outcomes. So we're setting ourselves up to have expense discipline. We're setting ourselves up to add relationships. We're setting ourselves up to deliver into those relationships which you see in loans deposits and many of our product areas, but how it lands in a given quarter is more difficult to forecast.", "John Stumpf", "Eric, we're enjoying some of the strongest growth years we have seen and what we describe as the core building blocks of long-term shareholder value creation, relationship, loans, deposits, depths of relationship, new primary checking household growth. And as John mentioned depending on the macro environment not all that shows up in that value creation the next quarter, but over the long period or even the interim period that is \u2013 the best way we think to successfully grow and add to the things that are customers and our shareholders value.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "No, certainly. So it sounds like than its basically top line led operating leverage stemming in part from continued shift in mix of revenue sources, is that fair?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, we surely want the top line, but we're watching the expenses were nothing goes on examined around here and we'll see how things turn out.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "And if I can just do one quick follow-up on asset quality, it sounds like from your commentary the go forward expectation should be for provision to roughly equal NCOs, is that right?", "John Shrewsberry", "So, it's up to forecast. We've gone through five years of reserve releasing. We've been saying for a few quarters that what's going to happened, subsequently it's going to reflect loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic outcomes. Does that mean that we remain at a no release, no provision level? That's too precise to forecast. But it should, if we grow our portfolio and the new assets look like the assets that we already have that we'll begin providing for those which could become more of net outcome as we're already had a generational low in terms of charge-offs which means that credit performance can't really improve meaningful from where we are today. It's already that good.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Great. Thanks very much.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.", "Scott Siefers", "Good morning, guys.", "John Shrewsberry", "Good morning.", "Scott Siefers", "John, I was hoping you could talk for a moment on some of the changes in the loan yields within the commercial buckets. A few of them like commercial mortgage, construction, leasing, they came under a little more pressure than I would have thought. I imagine at least to a certain extent that's due to both the financing on the GE deals, but was curious to get your color and thoughts on what might be going on there?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. So I wouldn't think of that as attributable to those assets coming on. It really has more to do with the variable sources that loan fees that sometimes accelerate that run through their PCI recoveries or other things that are more \u2013 that are harder to forecast in more one time, so you see them changing these two yields and these two dates side by side, but its not a general change in the inherent yield or the customer yield on the portfolio.", "Scott Siefers", "Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then just one sort of nitpicky question. Did you guys quantify anywhere the size of the gain from the Warranty Solutions business? I think when you announce it sold it for $150 million in cash, but I wasn't sure where it had been recorded on the books?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. It's less than a penny per share. I don't think that we did put that anywhere but you're the first person to ask it, so there you go.", "Scott Siefers", "All right. Okay. I think that\u2019s' \u2013 I'm all set. Thank you very much.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "David Hilder", "Good morning. Thank you. I noticed what appeared to be reversal of prior deferred comp expenses and wondered what the reason for that was?", "John Shrewsberry", "I don't think if it is a reversal, but every quarter our employee benefit expense on the one hand and our trading results on the other hand reflect the outcomes from our deferred comp approach. Our employees voluntarily defer comp and we neutralize the outcomes for them and we provide that return and we do it on a hedged basis, so that our results reflect. When our equity markets go up, our trading line goes up and our employ benefit expense goes up. When equity markets move down not just to generalize, the reverse is true. In this quarter we had equity markets down. We had trading revenue down and we had an equal amount of employee benefit expense down. So it's really just the cyclical ebbs and flows of that program. There's no change in approach or reversal of anything.", "David Hilder", "Great. Thanks very much.", "John Shrewsberry", "You're welcome. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Bush", "Good morning guys. How are you?", "John Shrewsberry", "Good morning.", "John Stumpf", "Nancy, good morning.", "Nancy Bush", "Two questions for you. John, when you did the initial GE portfolio acquisition I guess that was couple of quarters ago, you said that you were going to continue to look at assets at GE and obviously you did. I guess my question is GE going to continue to be keeps on giving, I mean, is there more there that you're looking at or is this sort of the end of the GE pot?", "John Shrewsberry", "So, you may have seen the list in the paper today of the 13 announcements that they've had since they declared that they were going to wind down GE capital and three of those line items are attributable to our activity, the commercial real estate, the railcar and now the commercial businesses. And we just incidentally we look very closely at many of the other things that look like they might have a fit for Wells Fargo and for one reason or another they were a better fit for somebody else either because of the asset type or the pricing scenario or something else.", "I think this pretty much concludes their U.S. business, I think they've got some things to sell around the world and because of our U.S. centric approach its probably true that we're not \u2013we wouldn't be playing a role like the role that we played in these three on those future acquisitions.", "Now having said that, we've been advisor in some of these other transactions, we've been a lender to a winning bidder in some of these other transactions. There maybe other things to do. But in the way we've approach these three businesses that were of these three portfolios that we're acquiring. I don't think there is more of that coming from GE capital.", "Nancy Bush", "My second question would be whether the integration of this latest large business from GE is basically going to preclude you from looking at other possible asset portfolios et cetera at other companies due to the funding issues?", "John Stumpf", "Yes, Nancy, I would answer it this way, never is a really definitive word, but I'd say on the other hand the focus right here now is to do this and do it really well. This is a lot to say grace over. We have lots of experiences in acquisitions. We're going to treat this as a merger, doing it well provide huge benefits to all those involved and that's job 1, job 2 and job 3 right now I do this really well.", "Nancy Bush", "IF you guys could just clarify I mean you're going \u2013 are you going to be moving people, how is this physically going to work?", "John Shrewsberry", "These businesses are primarily headquartered in the Chicago area and the Dallas area and nothing about that is intent to change. So there maybe some opportunity to -- for their people in the field to team up with our people in the field, but the bulk of the people will remain, doing what they're doing, right where they're doing and we'll figure out how to help, how to improve, how to optimize but not a big migration. Yes, we have real estate and locations and people on the Wells side in both those locations, so\u2026", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you, Nancy.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari ", "Good morning.", "John Shrewsberry", "Hey, John.", "John Pancari ", "Back to the loan yield topic, just based on your answer there is it -- are you implying that that commercial yield decline of 15 basis points that we saw this quarter could actually snap back next quarter?", "John Shrewsberry", "No it depends on what happens with resolutions, with prepayments that accelerate loan fees into yield etcetera, so it could. I'd say as a general matter based on where we are in the cycle there are fewer resolutions, fewer PCI windups today and I wouldn't expect. We're not making bad loans anymore, so we're buying them for that matter in quite that way.", "So I would expect that type of accounting to quiet down and more reflect the amortization of loan fees into yield, and then of course the acceleration of those when loans prepay. We are in the higher commercial loan prepayment environment probably just because things are so liquid. But I wouldn't expect it to snapback, but it certainly could increase a little bit, move around etcetera.", "John Pancari ", "Okay. And then one other thing on the margin, the swaps, I just want to get an idea of how much the swaps benefited the margin in the quarter and then also your appetite to add incremental swaps?", "John Stumpf", "So, we don't break out what the swaps benefit is to the margin as we have described, our approach to adding duration to the balance sheet for everyone's benefit, a portion of that\u2019s been done by swapping floating rate loans defect which has very similar impact to adding fixed rate securities to the portfolio. We don't anticipate a lot more of that activity.", "Today, I mentioned in response to one of the earlier questions that we think we are about where we need to be from an asset sensitivity perspective that could change its deposit flows, ebb and flow and we could end up with a lot of more liquidity to deploy, but at the moment, I think, we're \u2013 we like where we are from an asset sensitivity point of view and so we probably won't be moving rapidly down the path toward meaningfully growing the securities portfolio today or for swapping, more floating rate loans.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And then lastly just on the credit side, on energy just want to see if you are in a position to quantify your energy reserve right at this point and then also your criticized ratio in energy lending?", "John Stumpf", "We don't breakout the components of the allowance. But I can tell you that our approach through the first and second redetermination dates since the price of crude moved down meaningfully has been from my observation a conservative approach. We're re-rating credits down before waiting for information from borrowers based on what we know about relationship and trying to get ahead of this.", "So, well frankly as I mentioned in the services space we could continue to see more negative migration or even some meaningful negative migration in the industry. We feel great about where we are from allowance perspective in the energy space where we stand today. But we don't break out the component pieces of the allowances.", "John Pancari ", "Okay. Thanks. One more very quick one on that topic. The AFS portfolio with oil and gas bonds, I think you indicated a couple quarters back that it was around $1.5 billion. Is it still around that amount?", "John Shrewsberry", "I don't have the total in front of me, but I can tell you which is part of your question, actually 1.4 is the number. We took some OTTI in the quarter in that space. Those are of the corporate names in that portfolio, energy names were the ones that were most under water for the longest period of time which certainly a part of our review for other than temporary impairment and in the quarter in our results reflects taking those impairments through the P&L. So we feel good about our bases in those assets.", "John Pancari", "Got it. All right. Thank you.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.", "Paul Miller", "Yes, thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered. But on the jumbo loan market, it's one of the areas I think if you're not number one, I think you are number one, but we're seeing more and more market share go to the jumbo markets. Can you add more color around that?", "And then in the loans that you put in your portfolio my guess is most of them are jumbos. And where do you feel that you're going to be filled up there?", "John Stumpf", "So the loans that we put up as single family mortgage loans that we put on our balance sheet, virtually all of them are prime jumbo loans because as you know there is no secondary market for those loans, so to serve those customers we end up keeping them.", "John Shrewsberry", "You know frankly we \u2013 there is no magical numbers in terms of when we are full. Our total single family real estate portfolio hasn\u2019t shrunk or grown in the aggregate over the last few years meaningfully, the level stayed about the same, but we\u2019ve have home equity paying off. We've had pick-a-pay paying off, we\u2019ve had other lower quality loans winding down and prime jumbo loans winding up a little bit. And I guess I would anticipate that to continue as jobs are stronger and housing is stronger there are more people looking at those types of homes requiring those types of loans and only a balance sheet lender can provide that loan because there\u2019s no place in size for a mortgage company or any place else to go. There is no government program and there is no private label market.", "John Stumpf", "I\u2019d also add this, Paul that, as a percentage even though the overall real estate, present real estate totals have not changed, the quality has improved significantly and while the totals were the same since we\u2019ve grown our loans the percentage of those loans as a percentage of our overall portfolio, loan portfolio is down and those jumbos also tend to have a bit \u2013 they tend to turn over a bit because they have a little less duration because those folks tend to move more often and so forth. So, and these are for our very best customers and it\u2019s \u2013 and we are \u2013 we should be like that asset class.", "Paul Miller", "Okay, guys. Thank you very much.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you very much.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you. This concludes the call. Thank you all for joining us. We always appreciate your interest and involvement and again for all the questioners. We will see you here three months from now; it will be 2016 reflecting our fourth quarter earnings.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at Wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning and happy New Year. Thank you for joining us today. Our strong performance in 2015 reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and our focus on the real economy. Our contribution to the real economy in 2015 was broad-based and included originating $213 billion in residential mortgage loans, $31 billion of auto loans, almost in $19 billion in new loan commitments to our small business customers who primarily have less than $20 million in annual revenue, $34 billion of middle market loans and $29 billion of commercial real estate loans.", "We're active in facilitating the payments that drive economic activity across the country, with over $280 billion of debit card purchase volume, $70 billion of consumer credit card purchase volume and $25 billion of commercial card spend volume in 2015. We also contribute to the communities we serve in many other ways that are not directly reflected in our financial results, but are just as important to our success. For example, we've had the nation's number one United Way campaign for six consecutive years.", "Let me highlight a few of our other accomplishments during the past year. We generated earnings of $23 billion and earnings per share of $4.15. We grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profit. Our financial strength and competitive position have enabled us to capture opportunities for loan growth organically and through acquisitions, with average loans up $51 billion from a year ago, a 6% increase.", "Our deposit franchise once again, generated strong customer and balance growth with average deposits up $80 billion or 7% from a year ago and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.6%. Our credit results continued to be very strong, with our net charge-off rate declining to 33 basis points for the year. However, since we did not have any reserve release in the second half of the year, our provision expense increased $1 billion compared with a year ago.", "Our capital levels increased, even as we returned more capital to shareholders, our fifth consecutive year of increased returns. We returned $12.6 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in 2015. Turning to the economic environment, while parts of the global economy have continued to experience stress and the markets have reacted negatively in the early weeks of 2016, domestic economic conditions remain generally favorable.", "As you know, Wells Fargo is a U.S.-centric company and the strength and diversity of the U.S. economy benefited our results in 2015. The economy continues to advance with strong job creation, including 70 consecutive months of gains in private payrolls, the longest run ever recorded. While falling energy prices have hurt certain sectors of the U.S. economy, most consumers and many businesses are benefiting from lower power costs which results in more discretionary cash that can be used for other purposes. Auto vehicle sales were the best ever in 2015 and Wells Fargo originated a record number of auto loans during the year. If gas prices continue to remain low, 2016 should be another strong year for the auto market.", "The housing market also continued its steady improvement, with price appreciation of 6% helping homeowners build equity and improving the credit quality of our consumer real estate portfolio where net charge-offs were down 44% from a year ago. While December housing data is not yet available, 2015 appears to be the best year for home sales and housing starts since 2007.", "Inventories of homes for sale remain historically low, providing a tailwind for building activity into 2016. Commercial real estate appreciation has been even stronger than consumer real estate and vacancy rates for nearly all property types continue to decline. For apartments, vacancy rates are at historic lows which should benefit both construction activity and pricing in 2016.", "Finally, the building blocks of our long term growth, increasing our customer base, deepening relationships and growing loans and deposits continue to be the foundation of our success. I am excited about opportunities to continue to build on these growth drivers in the year ahead, as our team members remain focused on satisfying all of our customer's financial needs.", "John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our results. John?", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on page 2. John and I will then answer your questions. We had another quarter of solid results. While our fourth quarter earnings were the same as a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2014 had the benefit of a credit reserve release and the gain from the sale of our government guaranteed student loan portfolio, our results this quarter demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers. Compared with a year ago, we continued to have strong loan and deposit growth throughout our diversified commercial and consumer businesses.", "We grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profit. We had positive operating leverage as our expenses declined. Credit quality remained strong, with net charge-offs of 36 basis points of average loans and we continued to have strong liquidity and capital levels.", "Now let me highlight these key drivers in more detail. On page 3, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including growing revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans, deposits and earnings per share. These results are even more impressive when you consider some of the headwinds we faced in 2015, while we continued to invest in our business. For example, loan loss reserve releases declined from $1.6 billion in 2014 to $450 million in 2015.", "The sustained low rate environment and our disciplined redeployment of our strong deposit growth reduced our margin by 12 basis points. We continued to invest in risk management related activities and these expenses were up 12% compared with 2014. We strengthened our balance sheet with increased liquidity and capital levels.", "Turning to page 4, we grew earning assets 3% from third quarter with loans, short term investments and investment securities all increasing. Our funding sources increased with continued deposit growth and increased long term debt and short term borrowings. Long term debt increased $14.3 billion with $17.8 billion of issuances, including debt related to funding the previously announced GE Capital acquisitions.", "The debt we issued during the quarter had a weighted average maturity of about eight years, at a cost of approximately three-month LIBOR plus 70 basis points. However, $10.5 billion of these issuances have a shorter maturity and become eligible for prepayment during the first half of 2016. By beginning to pre-fund the GE Capital acquisitions, we were able to maintain our strong liquidity position and our healthy level of dry powder to fund prospective balance sheet growth, while retaining the flexibility to pre-pay a significant portion of the debt should we determine it is no longer needed.", "Turning to the income statement overview on page 5, revenue declined $289 million from third quarter, as growth in net interest income was offset by lower non-interest income primarily due to the higher level of equity investment gains in the third quarter. As shown on page 6, we had continued strong broad-based loan growth in the fourth quarter. We've now achieved year-over-year loan growth for 18 consecutive quarters.", "Our core loan portfolio grew by $62.8 billion or 8% from a year ago and was up $15.4 billion from the third quarter. Commercial loans grew $9.3 billion and consumer loans grew $6.1 billion from the third quarter. We did not acquire any loan portfolios in the fourth quarter, so the linked quarter growth was all organic.", "The GE Capital transactions that we announced last quarter will start to be reflected in our first quarter results. The GE Railcar Services transaction with $4.1 billion of loans and leases closed on January 1, making us the largest railcar operating lessor in North America.", "We anticipate the North American-based portion, about 90% of the approximately $31 billion of assets we expect to acquire from GE Capital, to close late in the first quarter, with the remainder expected to close in the second quarter. We're looking forward to having many talented and experienced people from these businesses join our team. Page 20 in the appendix has additional updates on these transactions.", "On page 7, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $28.1 billion or 10% from a year ago. The growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double-digit growth in commercial real estate, asset-backed finance, corporate banking, equipment finance, structured real estate and government and institutional banking.", "Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $15.9 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality nonconforming mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans grew $13.6 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter GE Capital acquisition in organic growth. Auto loans were up $4.2 billion or 80% from last year. We continued to benefit from a strong auto market, while we remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing.", "Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $3.3 billion or 9% from a year ago, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans. Credit card balances were up $2.9 billion or 9% from a year ago, benefiting from new account growth and strong growth in active accounts as we experienced better activation rates on new accounts and more active users among our existing customers.", "As highlighted on page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67 billion or 6% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 8 basis points, down 1 basis point from a year ago and stable with third quarter. We've stated that we believe deposit betas will be lower at least initially during this rate cycle and -- lower than they have been in past periods of rising rates. Indications since the rate move in December support this.", "However, we continue to monitor the market to ensure we remain competitive for our customers, while maintaining our disciplined relationship-based pricing strategy. This relationship focus has resulted in strong primary customer growth, with the primary consumer checking customers up 5.6% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers up 4.8% Primary customers are over twice as profitable as non-primary customers.", "Page 9 highlights Wells Fargo's revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. Over the past year as we benefited from balance sheet growth, we've been able to grow net interest income by 4% while noninterest income has been relatively stable compared with a year ago. As a result, net interest income generated just over half of our revenue in the fourth quarter.", "We grew net interest income $408 million from a year ago, even as the net interest margin declined 12 basis points. The $131 million increase in net interest income from third quarter reflected growth in earning assets and higher income from variable sources including periodic dividends, loan recoveries and fees. Net interest income also benefited modestly from the increase in interest rates late in the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by reduced income from seasonally lower balances of mortgages held-for-sale and increased interest expense from higher debt balances.", "The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the third quarter. Income from variable sources improved the margin by 2 basis points, but was offset by customer-driven deposit growth which reduce the margin by 3 basis points, with a minimal impact on net interest income. All other repricing growth and mix reduced the margin by another 3 basis points, driven largely by increased debt balances including the funding related to the GE Capital transactions that I mentioned earlier on the call.", "We demonstrated our ability to grow net interest income which was up 4% from a year ago through balance sheet growth, even in the challenging rate environment during 2015. On a full-year basis, we believe we can increase net interest income in 2016 compared with 2015, in part due to the December rate increase and also from anticipated balance sheet growth. If there are additional rate increases during 2016, we would expect our net interest income growth for 2016 to be higher than the 4% growth rate we achieved in 2015.", "Total noninterest income declined $420 million from third quarter, primarily driven by lower equity gains. Gains from equity investments were $423 million in the fourth quarter which were in line with the quarterly average over the past two years. Equity gains declined 6% in full year 2015, compared with 2014. And considering the current market conditions in our pipeline, we would expect continued declines in 2016.", "The volatile markets we've had so far this year could also impact our results in capital markets related businesses, including investment banking and trading and may also affect the asset-based valuations and transaction volumes in our market-driven businesses including retail, brokerage, asset management and trust.", "We had linked quarter growth in a number of our businesses including investment banking, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage and mortgage banking. Mortgage banking revenue increased $71 million from third quarter. Origination volume of $47 billion was down 15% from third quarter, reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 7% from a year ago benefiting from a stronger housing market. We ended the quarter with a $29 billion application pipeline, down 15% from third quarter, but up 12% from a year ago.", "Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 183 basis points in the fourth quarter, down from 188 basis points in the third quarter. Mortgage origination revenue in the fourth quarter benefited from $128 million repurchase reserve release, as we resolved certain exposures and revised liability assumptions. Higher mortgage origination revenue also reflected stronger multi-family mortgage activity in the fourth quarter.", "Other income declined $214 million from third quarter, driven by the impact of higher period end interest rates on our debt hedging results and the sale of Warranty Solutions last quarter which benefited third quarter income. There are also a few linked quarter changes in some fee categories that were not driven by business activity.", "Merchant processing fees as reported declined $182 million linked quarter. These fees are now reported in other income as a result of an accounting change which was P&L neutral. The increase in gains from trading activities this quarter was due to higher deferred compensation gains which are offset in employee benefits and are also P&L neutral.", "As shown on page 12, expenses were stable with the third quarter and we remain focused on expense management. There are a few items to highlight that impacted the linked quarter trend in some specific categories. The increase in employee benefits expense reflected $319 million of higher deferred comp expense which was primarily offset in trading revenue.", "Operating losses were down $191 million from third quarter from lower litigation accruals, while foreclosed asset expense declined $89 million due to commercial real estate recoveries. Also third quarter expenses included a $126 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. A number of our expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. Equipment expense was up $181 million, primarily due to annual software license renewals. Outside professional services increased $164 million which included higher project-related spending.", "Advertising expenses were also elevated up $49 million. While these typically higher fourth quarter expenses should be lower next quarter, as usual, we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense. Our efficiency ratio was 57.8% for the full year 2015 and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016.", "Turning to our business segments, starting on page 13, community banking earned $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 1% from a year ago and down 7% from third quarter. We continue to grow the number of retail bank households we serve and we're focused on building lifelong relationships with our customers by providing them with exceptional customer service. In fact, we were ranked number one in customer satisfaction in the national bank category according to the 2015 American Customer Satisfaction Index.", "We're growing our credit and debit card businesses through new customer growth and increased usage among existing customers. Debit card purchase volume was $73 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase volume was $18.9 billion, up 12% from a year ago. Our credit card penetration of retail banking households increased to 43.4% in the fourth quarter, up from 41.5% a year ago. We received the highest ranking in Corporate Insight assessment of credit card issuer rewards redemption options and just this week, we launched a new Propel American Express card with no annual fee.", "Our customers are also increasingly using our digital offerings, with active online customers up 7% and active mobile customers up 14% from a year ago. To better support our customers as they grow their companies, we've moved business banking and merchant payment services which were previously included within community banking to wholesale banking. For comparative purposes, prior periods segment results have been revised to reflect this realignment.", "Wholesale banking earned $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, stable from a year ago and up 9% from third quarter. The linked quarter growth reflected higher net interest and noninterest income. The increase in fee income was driven by investment banking and gains from the sale of equity fund investments driven by Volker, as well as commercial real estate related businesses such as Eastdil Secured, our commercial real estate brokerage and advisory business, Multifamily Capital and structured real estate.", "Revenue also benefited from continued balance sheet growth, with average loans up 13% from a year ago, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposits grew 6% from a year ago. We remain disciplined in our deposit pricing for our wholesale customers and we're focused on relationship-based pricing for both deposits and loans.", "Wealth and investment management earned $595 million in the fourth quarter, up 15% from a year ago and down 2% from third quarter. Growth from a year ago was driven by a positive operating leverage, with expenses down 2% and revenue up 1%.", "Revenue reflected strong balance sheet growth, with net interest income up 15% from a year ago. Average deposits grew 7% from a year ago and average loans grew 15%, the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Loan growth was broad-based, with strong client demand across a number of product offerings, including high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans, commercial loans and securities-based lending.", "Retail brokerage managed account assets were up 3% from third quarter and down 1% from a year ago. The decline from a year ago reflected lower market valuations which were partially offset by positive flows.", "Turning to page 16, credit quality remains strong, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified portfolio. Our net charge-off rate was 36 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs increased $128 million from third quarter, reflecting $90 million of higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio which totaled $118 million in the fourth quarter and seasonally higher consumer losses. The performance of our consumer real estate portfolios which are 36% of our loans outstanding continue to benefit from the improving housing market.", "Nonperforming assets have declined for 13 consecutive quarters and were down $497 million from third quarter, driven by improvements in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios and a $342 million reduction in foreclosed assets. Oil and gas non-accruals were $843 million, up $277 million from third quarter. However, as of yearend, over 90% of our nonaccrual oil and gas loans were current on interest payments.", "We didn't have a reserve release or build in the fourth quarter, as the improvement in our residential real estate portfolios was offset by higher commercial reserves, reflecting the impact from our oil and gas portfolio. Total loans in our oil and gas portfolio were down 6% from a year ago and are now less than 2% of total loans outstanding. ", "We continue to work closely with our customers and are monitoring market conditions and we have reset borrowing base determinations twice since energy prices started to decline in late 2014. However, as we've mentioned in the past, it takes time for losses to emerge and at current price levels, we would expect to have a higher oil and gas losses in 2016.", "We've considered the challenges within the energy sector in our allowance process throughout 2015 and approximately $1.2 billion of the allowance was allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. It's important to note that the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. We've also consider the impact of lower energy prices on our debt and equity securities portfolio and had approximately $130 million of OTTI-related write-downs in our energy-related holdings in the quarter.", "Turning to page 17, our capital levels remained strong, with our estimated Common Equity Tier I ratio fully phased in at 10.7% in the fourth quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers in our internal -- and buffers -- regulatory and minimum in buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital generation positioned us well for the acquisitions we announced in 2015 and for returning more capital to shareholders. We returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases and our net payout ratio was 59%.", "In summary, our fourth quarter and full-year results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model, with strong growth in loans and deposits and consistent earnings. We continued to invest in our businesses, grew capital and liquidity and maintained a strong risk culture. We're excited about the opportunities ahead and expect our customer base to grow both organically and through acquisitions, including from the customers and platforms we're acquiring from GE Capital in 2016. We remain focused on satisfying our new and existing customer's financial needs.", "John and I will now answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Matt O'Connor", "If we could just circle back on some of the energy comments, maybe get the exact underlying balances. You said, first on the energy loans, less than 2% of your total loan book. If you have that exact number? And then, same thing, in terms of some of the fixed income and equity exposure, just to have a sense of the gross energy risk in those three buckets?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. So I would use $17 billion as outstandings for energy loans. And for securities, call it $2.5 billion which is the sum of AFS securities and nonmarketable securities.", "Matt O'Connor", "Okay. And then just remind us on the lending side, the mix of investment grade versus non-investment grade or unrated?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. I would -- of the $17 billion -- actually the first cut I would give you is upstream, midstream services, because I think that's germane. And I'd tell you that's about one-half upstream and one quarter services and one quarter midstream. And I think for that cut, we've separated out our investment grade component. So that what we're focused on are really the -- call it the BB and down, middle market, private clients.", "Matt O'Connor", "Okay. And I'm sorry, of the $17 billion, how much of that piece that you are focused on?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, we're focused on the whole thing. Half of those customers -- one-half of those balances represent E&P companies, upstream companies. One quarter of them represent oilfield services companies and one quarter of them represent pipelines and storage and other midstream activity. And it excludes, what I would describe as investment grade -- diversified, the larger cap companies where we don't view their credit exposure as quite the same.", "Matt O'Connor", "Okay. And is this more--", "John Shrewsberry", "Not much of that to begin with.", "Matt O'Connor", "Okay. And then just more broadly speaking, I mean, obviously is a very balanced loan portfolio and as you mentioned, consumer-heavy if anything. But any thoughts on how much more improvement there is still to come on the consumer side? And assuming maybe the macro either holds or just has a soft patch overall, is there still some embedded improvement that we could see, I guess, really in the real estate portfolios, on the consumer side?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, I mean, our outlook for housing in 2016 is actually pretty strong. We've got a little bit more supply coming in. You've got more household formation. We're going to have a four handle on unemployment before you know it and we've got low rates. So if that continues to be true, that's probably a continued tailwind, in terms of some of the drivers of the estimation of embedded loss on the consumer real estate side of the loan portfolio. And without putting a number on it, because you only know it when you get there, I think that's supportive.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Betsy Graseck", "Just a follow-up on the energy question, you indicated during the prepared remarks that over 90% of the portfolio is current and that you've reset two times. But if prices stay where they are today, you'd have higher losses in 2016. I just wanted to understand, maybe give us a sense of -- as oil price comes down here, what kind of rate of change we should be expecting, as we're building out the model in 2016 for provisions?", "John Shrewsberry", "Can I make one correction to your set up there which is--", "Betsy Graseck", "Yes.", "John Shrewsberry", "Over 90% of nonperforming oil and gas loans are performing. All of the other ones are performing. In terms of rate of change, when we think about the allowance that we have today, frankly, we could imagine prices not improving from where they are today. And so, the rate of change of how loans actually move to loss, reflects a lot of things and it's not just price. And we just described for Matt, the distribution of upstream, midstream services and each of them behave differently.", "We've got customers that are oil or gas heavy, depending on what their business model. It looks a little bit different, basin by basin around the country and by method of extraction as well. So there's a lot more to what losses are going to look like in 2016 than just the spot price or the expected near forward price of crude. Having said that, we've sensitized it such that we're sitting here at -- in the $30 area a year from now and believe that our allowance accurately or appropriately reflects the loss content that we may have.", "John Stumpf", "And Betsy, just to add, we have some of the most skilled people, 250 or so folks who have been in this industry a long time, have seen changes and we're big time focused on this. But as Matt just asked a few minutes ago, we also should step back and look at the entire portfolio. And when you have 36% of your loans as John mentioned in residential real estate, a small improvements there is huge for this company. All portfolios are important, but I just want to make sure we look at this in perspective.", "Betsy Graseck", "Right, absolutely. I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that reserve, because roughly 7%, it's one of the higher ones we've heard of. So I'm expecting that you are not just using the forward curve on oil to set your reserving levels.", "John Shrewsberry", "That's correct. We're using the idiosyncratic, customer by customer circumstances, including the things that I mentioned. And their individual leverage activity, what's going on customer by customer.", "Betsy Graseck", "Yes. Because, I mean, the question has been, as the oil price goes down and then you get closer extraction costs and your reserves go negative. How do you deal with that kind of environment? And I'm just wondering how much of that you've already priced into the reserve that you've got?", "John Shrewsberry", "We think it's appropriate for the risk that we have embedded in the portfolio, the prices that we're living with today and can imagine into the future and as I've said, the sum of the circumstances of each one of our borrowers. And when you add it up, it's a little -- it would appear to be a little bit heavier than some of the others who have reported.", "John Stumpf", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "On the energy side again, just do you have the criticized energy ratio for that portfolio? And then, separately, just getting to that sensitivity question, if we did see oil pull into the $20s and stay there, $20 to $25 range, can you give us just an idea of how, the magnitude of the increase and the loss migration under that scenario?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. So criticized assets today or at the end of the quarter in that portfolio are about 38% of outstandings. And there isn't a simple way to dimension what the change would be in losses, based on some other future price income. As I mentioned to Betsy, we're sensitizing our portfolio based on a continuation of very, very, very low oil prices, the context of where we're today, rather than an upward sloping curve, in addition to scenarios that include an upward sloping curve and we're comfortable with the amount of coverage that we have today. That's how I'd think about it.", "John Pancari", "Yes. Okay. All right, and then separately, on the spread revenue side, you indicated that net interest income should grow -- it could exceed the 4% growth that you saw in 2015, if you get hikes. How many hikes are you assuming and how much greater than the 4% could it be?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. So we've got a one hike, two hike, three hike and four hike scenario that we're operating with, because like you, we can't say for sure what's going to happen. We've done a -- we worked very hard to produce the type of net interest income growth that we have in a no hike environment for the last several years. So we'll see what the future holds, because it feels a little bit different every day.", "But if we got three or four hikes, could we end up in mid to high single-digit percentage growth rates for net interest income? That math would pencil out. But it's going to be a function of organic loan growth, closing on our GE portfolios that we've been talking about and then the number of hikes that come and when they come.", "John Pancari", "Okay. Then lastly, what would that mean in terms of the margin outlook, if you do get -- under those hike scenarios with--", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, well, it begins to expand. Another way of thinking about it is, I wouldn't expect it to begin to expand, until continued hikes begin to layer in. Particularly as we've said, while we're -- we've pre-funded a little bit of debt, so that we're in a great position to close on these assets that we're acquiring. So that's a little bit of a margin headwind. That has to -- those loans have to hit the books, so that that burns off. And then, we need to have -- first, a 25 basis point move, while important and symbolic, doesn't really do much.", "Even though we've been very slow to react or appropriately slow to react, in terms of our own deposit pricing activity, it's the subsequent ones that would have a meaningful impact on margin. And having said all that, what we're really focused on is growing dollars of net interest income and the balance sheet structural issues, as we have rapid deposit growth or funding activity, etcetera, have an impact on the margin, but it's about dollars for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Erika Najarian", "On the efficiency guide for full-year 2016 at the upper end of your 55% to 59% range, you noted that for the full year 2015, you were at 57.8%. And I'm wondering if you could walk us through the puts and takes, in terms of operating leverage staying flat? And also to follow up with John's question, how many interest rate hikes is that upper end of the 55% to 59% range on efficiency embed?", "John Shrewsberry", "So in terms of puts and takes and 2015 versus 2016, we're still in an elevated time for what I would describe as compliance risk management, technology including cyber-related spend. We're still in an elevated time of product development and sort of offensive related spend. And so, I think that that's part of what guides us to this higher end for the time being.", "One notable difference in 2016 versus 2015, I'm not sure if anybody else has focused on this in their calls, but we also have this new incremental FDIC insurance surcharge, every bank over $10 billion in assets. And that's worth $480 million pre-tax to Wells Fargo for its partial year impact in 2016. So we're all going to have something like that for the next year or two, while that works its way through. So I would think about that. And that begins I think in Q2 of 2016. And then, if it's enacted in its current form which it's anticipated to be.", "So if we have two or three moves in 2016 by the Fed and if they happen ratably throughout the course of the year, that incremental revenue will have a beneficial impact on efficiency ratio. But it -- I don't know that it drives us below the middle of the range. So I think the range is still appropriate.", "We'll probably focus more on that and the other targets that we give you in our May Investor Day. There's a little bit of time between now and then to really set the course for the next couple of years, that reflect the environment, that reflect the balance sheet structure that we have, that reflect our expense profile. But I still feel like it's appropriate to think about the higher end of the range, so the 57% to 59% for this year, unless it rates really, really begin to move which seems hard to imagine sitting here at this moment.", "John Stumpf", "And Erika, how we think about expenses around here is, that we're pretty tight-fisted when it comes to making sure that the expenses, the investments we do make have shareholder benefits to them. As John mentioned, defensive, offensive, we're spending a lot of money in compliance, cyber and on the other hand, we're spending also a lot of money on items and issues and things that create convenience for customers, mobile payments and a whole bunch of other things. And we always try to take a long term view. But there's a lot of discussion that takes place about managing expenses and making sure that the investments we're making do have a long term pay off for us.", "Erika Najarian", "And just, I heard you loud and clear, in terms of the proportion of your energy exposure relative to the consumer side. But my question on this is really on CCAR. I'm wondering, did you get enough color back from your regulators, in terms of how oil and gas losses were stressed in the 2015 CCAR and how that level is comparing to the base case right now that's embedded in your reserve? I think that the next question for investors is a worry that, while everybody seems appropriately -- could be appropriately reserved for actual, that there could be an exorbitant amount of stress applied to that portfolio in the 2016 CCAR?", "John Shrewsberry", "It's certainly possible. We haven't gotten those instructions for that specific scenario analysis yet. Separately, it won't surprise you that we're very transparent, spend a lot of time talking with the regulatory community about what's going on in energy. They are fully aware of how our portfolio works. But as you mentioned, at the beginning of that statement, it's important to remember that we're talking about 2% of a $920 billion loan portfolio. So they know that. We know that and the math benefits from that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.", "Bill Carcache", "Does the decision by one of your large competitors to pass the 25 basis point increase through to their commercial depositors influence at all, how you guys view the degree to which you and others in the industry will benefit from higher rates?", "John Shrewsberry", "So it depends. I mean, our wholesale teams -- and there are -- each of the different customer segment relationship teams provides a different set of insight onto what their competitive set is doing. There are some banks who I think, sounds like anyway, are being a little quicker to raise deposit rates. And in the wholesale space, there we're competing on -- we're competing on service, we're competing on product.", "We're competing on a lot of things. And at the margin, there's also the impact of price for certain balances. Some deposits are worth more than others, from a liquidity point of view. Some relationships are worth more than others. And I'd say we're very in tune with what we think we need to do to maintain relationships and to reward customers where we have a big relationship and a lot going on.", "John Stumpf", "We've been through this before. And we try to stay really focused, Bill, on customer and providing them great value. And I think what John is saying and what we're all saying is, there is value to the entire relationship. There is value to the products we have and services and surely deposit pricing is one of those value items. But it's not a standalone item.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. And one observation that I would have -- and this is very early days in this -- is that some of the feedback I've seen are the -- that the customers who seem to be the most price-sensitive on the deposits are the customers whose deposits have the lowest liquidity value to Wells Fargo. So sometimes, it's easy to see those go.", "Bill Carcache", "Separately, if I may, I saw your recent transaction update on slide 20, but was hoping you could give a little bit more color on client retention initiatives and whether there are any issues there? And some of those acquired specialty finance businesses, like Vendor Finance for example, were pretty nichey. And it feels like it was really, Wells and GE and like the CITs of the world that really played in those areas. So just curious, whether GE's exit you think increases your ability to grow share across those businesses, as we look forward from here?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. Well, we certainly hope that it does. And I'd say, that in Vendor in particular -- I think we mentioned this one we announced the deal. But as you described GE has this great business, that's close to the OEMs that helps them finance their sales to their customers.", "Now from a Wells Fargo perspective, most of those OEMs are already customers of Wells Fargo in one way or another and most of their customers are already -- or many of their customers are already customers of Wells Fargo in one way or another. So it's a way for us to really enrich the relationship, get closer to the manufacturer. And in some cases, expand a program that we may already have been a smaller player in and in other -- in many other cases, to create a program or to step into a program that is working well.", "But I'd say overall, customer reception has been great, as our leaders have reached out and traveled around with our new GE teammates and talked to the customers of the GE businesses. I don't think customer retention has not surfaced as an issue. It's just a question of how quickly and how well we can expand the product penetration, given all that Wells Fargo has to offer a wholesale customer in each of those instances.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Ken Usdin", "My question is on fees, specifically if you could start on the brokerage business. Obviously, the market values are now weighing on the underlying growth, but I was wondering if you could just give us your outlook for growth in the brokerage business which unfortunately has comped now a little negative on a year-over-year basis. But can you just kind of distinguish between market levels, impacts and what you're seeing from a customer activity perspective as you look to 2016?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. I mean, it's made a little bit more complicated by what's going on -- in these couple of weeks, in terms of just with respect to the impact of asset-based fund or fee type arrangements. So it's hard to ballpark at the moment. But we have good, strong growth of inflows of both accounts and account assets. And if we were in a more normalized S&P environment, then we'd be talking about the continuity of call it, the single-digit percentage growth that has been working for us for the last few years. But when you overlay this market instability, it depends, A, on what levels we end up at, because that'll influence what we're multiplying times a fee schedule. And, B, we customers do, whether customers are -- stay invested, get more invested or back away as volatility increases.", "I think it's David's expectation to continue to grow the business by adding new customers, to encourage customers to stay invested, if that's appropriate for where they are in their investing life cycle, to use these as entry points for people who have more money to put to work and longer term goals.", "So it's going to come and go, move a little bit as equity markets move up and down. But I think what we're talking about in revenue terms, even with the type of pullback that we've had in the first quarter is call it, hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of net income sensitivity, if we weren't to recover from here and if we didn't have meaningful new customer -- new client growth over the course of the year, so.", "Ken Usdin", "And then secondly, just on the mortgage business, if you could also just, ex the MSR drive [ph] -- which can swing big up or down, how much more retrenching do we still have of the servicing portfolio? And what's just your expectation, if it's different than just kind of the MBA, Fannie, Freddie for what you think the mortgage market does in the year ahead?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. So I think the MBA is calling for a $1.5 trillion or $1.6 trillion, down to $1.4 trillion mortgage market in 2016 versus 2015 and our folks seem to be in sync with that. In terms of servicing retrenching, it's -- we'll get to a more normalized level of defaulted loan workout activity over the course of the next couple of years, as that -- the full crisis era inventory works it's way off. And then, we'll find out what the stabilized run rate is for productivity, for how many people it takes to service a portfolio of our size that's behaving more normally.", "And so, there is incremental benefit to take out but we're not in a hurry to do it. It's more important about the loans are serviced properly and customers are dealt with in a way that they require. But so, there's some upside there. And unreimbursed servicing costs, I'd say are -- as we look out, they start to improve quarter by quarter, over the course of the next several. So that's one benefit. But we'll see.", "But in terms of the market overall, we're very, very big in conforming with Fannie and Freddie and there's more to do there. We think of it more as more of a purchase market as we go forward, especially if rates increase, although they're going the other way right now. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier, some of the early indicators for purchase activity look really good, more jobs, more available housing to buy and more people moving into prime first-time home buyer and second-time homebuyer age cohorts. Those are all very supportive and so--", "John Stumpf", "And household formation--", "John Shrewsberry", "And household formation is up meaningfully. So that's good news.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.", "Scott Siefers", "But I think that most of my questions have been answered. But maybe back on the energy portfolio, just broadly, if you guys can speak to how your -- just how you are treating customers at a top level? You don't think there's a sense that banks are not necessarily pulling back credit the way you might if you had this kind of a correction in any other sort of asset value, so just at a top level? And then, John I think you had said in your comments about the NPAs there, I just want to make sure I heard that correctly. Is it 90% of the oil and gas NPAs are current on interest only? I just want to make sure I heard that correctly as well.", "John Shrewsberry", "Current on interest is what I said. Yes. So in terms of pullback and credit availability, I would expand the description to say, not just bank credit, but capital markets were actually, as you know, were quite open for energy companies very early in this. And that has gone away. My understanding is that smaller banks, regional banks, have only recently begun to really pull back from a willingness to provide credit. Maybe it's this incremental leg down to where we're on crude prices that has people generally believing that this could be where we're for a longer time.", "I wouldn't say that there is a tremendous demand for incremental credit right now. It's more about how quickly you're asking or requiring your customers to come into conformance under their borrowing base. What you're doing with their excess cash, what they're doing with their CapEx program. And I'd say, we're all being as appropriately tough, to make sure that we protect the interests of the bank. We're very -- we're working with each customer to help them work through this. It doesn't do us any good to accelerate an issue or two, to end up as the holder of a number of oil leases as a bank.", "And so, that dictates some of the cadence. Services companies I think are different than E&P companies, because for some of them it's really not about a $5 band of oil prices or a $10 band of oil prices. They're either in business or they're not in business. And if they're not in business, you have got to figure out how to maximize the recovery as quickly as possible, because some of their inventory which is security for the loan may be very single-purpose. And I'd say that's a little bit of a different workout. I don't know if that's helpful, but that's how we're seeing it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.", "Paul Miller", "On the mortgage banking side, can you talk a little bit about how TRID has impacted on the mortgage banking revenues? It looks like you guys did a pretty good quarter, despite a lot of disruptions that TRID brought to the market.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. So we spent a lot of time preparing ourselves for it technology-wise, data management-wise, so that we could flip a switch and collect the right data and have the right disclosures, etcetera. We've not seen a meaningful impact to our results in our retail channel or from our work with correspondents. There are probably some lower volume programs that we or others would have deemphasized, while we emphasize preparing ourselves for the new requirements in our bigger programs. So as those -- or as those have come online, etcetera, maybe we see a little bit of a snapback, but you wouldn't even notice that in the numbers. So for the most part, the impact I'd say, has been immaterial.", "Paul Miller", "And then, in the 2015 especially in the second half of the year we saw on the macro data and I think even on your micro data, a big pick up in purchase originations. Probably the large -- the third quarter was the largest origination quarter for purchases since 2007, 2008. Do you think TRID interrupted that? Are you still seeing very strong demand for the purchase market, despite all this volatility?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, you have to seasonally adjust that analysis, but I think it's our take that it didn't really interrupt it.", "John Stumpf", "It just adds a week, Paul. It really does. And it turns out to be in many cases, a bit of an inconvenience to a customer. But it's what it is -- but I don't think it's really had an impact.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "John McDonald", "Two quick follow-ups on debt issuance, just with the GE, I just wanted to make sure that I understood, is that fully funded now or is that partially funded? Can you say how much -- how much of that is funded already?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. Through the end of the year, I'd say, it's 2/3rds.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And the expectations for earnings accretion turned a little bit more positive in your update? Has anything changed there or you've just refined your estimate from when you first did the deal?", "John Shrewsberry", "It's the latter. It's refining the estimate of the expenses that we're going to consume to properly transition all the team members, to do data work around the customers, etcetera. Although it's just important to say, the big emphasis here is on the lifetime relationship we're going to have these customers. I know that it's important to you guys to get what the first few months mean, but we're much more concerned on an orderly transition and a nice integration and a good feeling for both customers and team members. And that's expensive.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And then, on TLAC, any update on potential TLAC issuance? I think your original estimate was up $40 billion to $60 billion. And have you done some of that already and what will be maybe the timing or time frame over which you do the rest?", "John Shrewsberry", "So the estimate is still the same. We did do a little bit in the fourth quarter, $6 billion to $7 billion I think in the fourth quarter of what would be TLAC eligible. This is a little bit of a subtlety, but now that the NPR is out and while the NPR is out, there is a little ambiguity about what's eligible and what's not. And so, that will slowdown issuance during the NPR period, so that none of us issue something that turns out not to be either conforming or grandfathered.", "So it'll be slow here for a quarter or two probably, but it's our goal to get our full requirement, whatever it ultimately is in place with plenty of room before the actual -- the final phase-in date of 1/1/2022. So we will update folks as we go along, to let them know where we're on that journey and what the impact is.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joe Morford", "John, you talked about the economy, but what's customer sentiment like lately? Are you seeing much confidence to borrow and make investments and given the macro uncertainties? And also, while the consumer is benefiting from lower gas prices, are you seeing much willingness to spend?", "John Stumpf", "So far, Joe, with respect to consumers, they have not spent a lot of their gas savings so far. I think you'll start to spend some more -- and the thing for Wells Fargo is 97% of what we do is in the U.S.. And virtually everything we do in the U.S. is involved in the real economy. And there are pockets of strengths. You think of autos, you think of commercial real estate, you think of residential real estate, parts of ag, some middle market. And I don't -- I'm not going to say it's robust, but we're really happy we're all-in in the U.S.. Let's put it that way.", "Joe Morford", "And then, how did also how did the recruitment of the Credit Suisse private bankers go relative to expectations? And was there any impact from this on expenses this quarter and what would be the magnitude and timing of the assets under management you might expect to transfer over?", "John Shrewsberry", "So I think it's going on -- as David would describe it, as planned, in terms of number of people who have or will be joining Wells Fargo. I don't think they've actually disclosed a hard number on that, but it's a good outcome. And I assume it'll take one to two quarters after people join for them begin to migrate their customer accounts over to Wells Fargo. That's probably more of a second half impact.", "And, frankly, even with the maximum number of people, the total people that were originally referred to in that arrangement that we had with Credit Suisse, what it looks like is three, four or five months' worth of organic financial advisor recruitment. It's not a huge game-changer in terms of the numbers. It's great. We've got the exact right people for our platform. They add a lot of capability. They have a lot of great customer relationships that we're excited to have. But I would think of that more as a modest acceleration of what would have been organic activity, rather than a game-changing activity in this segment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.", "Brian Foran", "So I guess, there is an industrial company reporting as you're speaking, so I don't mean to hijack you, since you obviously haven't heard of it. And I don't even know if I'm pronouncing it right, Fastenal or something, but they're kind of making the statement that we're in an industrial recession. They're seeing some of their underlying customers with orders down 25%-plus year-over-year.", "So I wonder if you could comment, like when you just talk to that kind of industrial component of your customer base, who maybe is a more exposed to cutbacks by the energy industry and the strong dollar, do you think it's possible we actually are in an industrial recession right now?", "John Shrewsberry", "So my observation would be, for certainly for folks who are selling into the energy extraction or processing businesses, it's been a tough year and will continue to be. And I'd be surprised if those orders were only down 25%. But I think more broadly, at least as it reveals itself in our own customer activity, people who are more reliant on exports have been -- were hit early and hit hard by how strong the dollar has become over the course of the last couple of years.", "And but more broadly, it's as John described, right? It's not robust. People aren't super enthusiastic. But you've seen the growth in our commercial loan portfolios which reflects people doing business. And some -- a lot of that is us taking business from other people, but in a significant portion of those cases, that's folks borrowing money to do things, to buy things. And it doesn't feel like a manufacturing recession to me. Although, I'm sensitive to manufacturers who ship everything overseas and who are trying to sell it in dollars, because that's a more expensive proposition.", "John Stumpf", "Yes. As John mentioned, we're a very diversified company. We lend to all sectors of the economy, farmers, ranchers, 2% of our loans in oil and gas, commercial real estate, middle market. And so, you're going to have some companies because of what they are doing are going to be impacted more than others. And I can surely see where Fastenal, who -- it's a Midwestern company, I know that company, it's a great company -- will have some issues or would be saying the things they're saying. That makes sense to me, given their product mix.", "Brian Foran", "I thought they were based in Minnesota. So I figured it was fair to ask.", "John Stumpf", "I know them. They're great.", "Brian Foran", "And then, I guess, just stepping back on fees. I guess, one of the things that just strikes me looking at the model is, they have kind of been bouncing around $10 billion a quarter, ever since the Wachovia deal. And I guess, that speaks to some of the benefits of diversity in the business, because there have been some huge headwinds like the mortgage bubble popping and all that. Do you think we're finally at the point where, the underlying business momentum that you've clearly generated can start leading to higher reported consolidated fees? Or is there still maybe another year of headwinds with the lower equity markets and lower refi volumes and stuff like that?", "John Shrewsberry", "So the bigger categories would be deposit service charges which are both consumer and commercial. And I would say there's a nice trajectory there and we were impacted in a way that call it, in the immediate post-merger time frame where things were cut back and then growing. And they have been growing nicely and continue to, both by adding new customers and adding new capability. So that's a strength and something that will continue to grow. Card fees, the big emphasis there, both debit and credit and are moving down the path to really grow our credit card business I think will help there.", "In the wealth and investment management business, as we've talked about, a big portion of it will be a function of what happens with equity markets. But we're growing the customer base. We're growing assets under management and that may be more volatile, given what's going on with the S&P, but that certainly a source of growth over any reasonable time frame. Those categories are our bread-and-butter, fundamental banking activity that we feel really good about.", "At the margin, we also have as we've mentioned, this step down to a more normalized level of equity gains. That's something that has to be grown through, in your analysis, the mortgage market as we've said, even if we're doing more, if that market isn't growing much, then we'll be impacted one way or the other by that. So it's our goal to work to grow the aggregation of those line items in the way that you're describing. But each of them has their own character. That diversification has worked for us over the past several years as you mentioned. But there is a lot to do to grow them.", "Brian Foran", "I could sneak in a very short one on energy, is there any material second lien exposure in the oil portfolio?", "John Shrewsberry", "Not material. No. There is a little bit in a business that we call energy capital, but in the context of the numbers that we've been talking about, it's not material.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mike Mayo", "Just a couple clarifications, so you have $1.2 billion of reserves on oil and gas credits and you have $17 billion of oil and gas credits. Is that right?", "John Shrewsberry", "Correct, outstanding.", "Mike Mayo", "So you have 7% reserves against your oil and gas portfolio?", "John Shrewsberry", "The math works out to 7% on that allocation, but I'd point out that we have a $12 billion allowance for loan losses, all of which is available for losses wherever they occur in the portfolio, but yes. Our own internal allocation of what's applied to that portfolio would get you to 7%.", "Mike Mayo", "So I think you're winning on that 7% percentage. I mean, some others are at 3%, 4%, 5%. So I guess -- but I didn't get the answer to the question before, what percent of the $17 billion are -- is non-investment grade?", "John Shrewsberry", "I would say most of it, most of it.", "Mike Mayo", "So most of the $17 billion is non-investment grade?", "John Shrewsberry", "Correct.", "Mike Mayo", "So would that 7% figure reflect that mix then of having more non-investment grade credits or would it reflect more conservatism than peers?", "John Shrewsberry", "As I mentioned, everyone of these portfolios is different, based on who their customers are, what their business mix looks like, what basins, what extraction method, what their corporate leverage looks like. So it's hard to compare. I do agree that 7% is winning though, in terms of the reported numbers.", "Mike Mayo", "And just to clarify what you said before, if oil stays at $30 for the next year, you still feel that the $1.2 billion of reserves on the oil and gas portfolio is sufficient? Is that correct?", "John Shrewsberry", "Correct.", "Mike Mayo", "Okay. And now let's just pull the lens back a little bit. John, you've been through many cycles. And I am just wondering, is the decline in the oil and gas sector similar to other industry specific declines that then spill over on the broader economy? In other words, what comes to my mind is 2002, TMT, there you had add Enron, WorldCom, you had a spillover effect. You had some market concerns, you had some losses. Or what other period does this seem similar to? Or is this stretching too much, this oil and gas thing, it's fine, it's going to blow over? Where do you stand?", "John Stumpf", "Actually, Mike, it's a great question. I go back to 1985 or the early 1980s, when I ran the workout group. In fact, I got to see our Denver-based energy business up close at that time. So I -- and then we saw, of course, there has been a couple cycles since that time. And this one is different in a couple of respects. First of all, the economy in the U.S. is more diversified, so the communities in which energy plays a role is more diversified. Not true in every community but and we look at that.", "Secondly, companies this time around reacted much more quickly. I think in past recessions -- in past corrections, there was more hope and prayer going on, for higher prices or a rebound. And so, they reacted quickly. And I would also say this time around, the way companies finance themselves, there is more private equity and other debt that would be subordinate to the bank debt. So there are differences.", "And I would say the final thing is, the mismatch between supply and demand at the world level is fairly narrow. So there's about 93 million barrels produced a day and about 92 consumed. So it's a very narrow mismatch and demand seems to still be increasing. So I am not suggesting that's going to make this problem go away anytime soon. The Saudis are pumping like crazy. So are the Russians and of course, with what happened with tight oil here in the U.S., but there are differences. And our people who run this portfolio for us have seen many or most of those cycles. So everyone is different.", "John Shrewsberry", "One thing I would add is, certainly plenty of opportunity for a market-related contagion when one industry is suffering and other industries are starting -- are trying to borrow. But in this instance, cheap oil is a net stimulative impact on U.S. growth. A WorldCom fraud was not beneficial for everybody else in the U.S. Telecom didn't get cheaper. But fuel has gotten cheaper which is good for consumers and good for other--", "John Stumpf", "And Mike, I'll give you one other example. I was with a large builder in the Texas market not long ago. And they were talking about the fact that some of what's happening in oil and gas in the field services is making cement more available and workers and so forth that are important to housing. So I'm not suggesting it happens everywhere, everyone's different.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.", "Marty Mosby", "John, I wanted to ask you about the cross-sell ratio, something you've always prided, in the sense of being able to show improvement, kind of peaked out last year and this year, we're actually seeing it come down a little bit. So just was wondering how those trends are looking, in the sense of being able to sell more to your products?", "John Stumpf", "Sure. So how that works is, we take total product holdings divided by total customers. And we're actually seeing the denominator grow faster now than we've seen it in some time and first-year customers don't have an average of six products. They are more in the four range, so that has a bit of a dilutive impact on that.", "And also, as you get to the higher value products, the sales cycle or solutions cycle tends to be a bit longer. So this is actually a good problem I think, in that when you're growing net new primary checking accounts by 5.6%, the goal is not necessarily a ratio. The goal is to have long term mutually beneficial relationships with customers where we help them succeed financially. So I'm happy with where we're in that. But thank you for the question. It's a good question.", "Marty Mosby", "And then, on the net interest margin, can we just think about this -- let's forget about the funding cost and deposits, because everybody's skittish on committing to what's going to happen, given the dynamic of competition. But let's just think about earning assets and the floating loans and short term liquid assets that you have. With the 25 basis point rise that we saw in December, how much should we see the impact on that positive to earning asset yields, just isolating out that one piece of the equation?", "John Shrewsberry", "So it depends on the existing and changing distribution between one-month, three-month LIBOR-based loans, prime-based loans, fixed loans, LIBOR loans that we swap to fixed rate and there's a lot that goes into it.", "So it's hard to isolate it. I'd say that, when we think back to the way that we separated our interest rate sensitive categories for illustrative purposes at the last Investor Day, we would have said that 20%ish and this is both asset and liability side, so it's a different answer than what you're asking -- but that we would've gotten, call it 20% of a change flowing through and the range was 10% to 30%. And I think we're probably at the low end of that range right now, but that's picking up both assets and liabilities.", "I can tell you also that LIBOR resets seem to have occurred the way we would've expected them after the Fed moved in December. So the asset side is behaving as we expected and a 25 basis point move is not a giant needle mover, in terms of dollars and cents for Wells Fargo. On a net basis, you're talking about $100 million to $200 million a quarter or something like that. So all things being equal which they never are, but that's the order of magnitude.", "Marty Mosby", "And then, just lastly, was there any disruption on investment banking, from some of the things that we saw with high yield freezing up and some of the processing there, of just being able to deliver into the market, because investment banking has been a big grower, a benefit for you all as well. So just wanted to see if there was any disruptions in the quarter that you experienced in that side?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. So I wouldn't describe anything as a disruption. There is sort of two ways that on the sell side that we might be impacted. One is, how do net long credit are we in our trading businesses? And I think we managed that really, really well and it wasn't really disruptive. And then, are the markets open and are we representing clients and helping them raise money in the high yield market? And that's been harder to do, given the volatility that we've seen.", "Our share is still about the same. We're between 4% and 5% of U.S. investment banking fees. That's capital markets activity, advisory activity, etcetera, but it didn't have a big impact. We were up in the fourth quarter over the third quarter in investment banking fees overall which you'd expect. The fourth quarter is seasonally, usually a busier time, M&A activity, etcetera, but no disruption.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Barker", "You mentioned that the amount of criticized loans in your energy portfolio was 38% of outstandings. What was it last quarter? And could you also describe how many of your energy loans are either in a second lien position or subordinated position compared to first lien holders?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. So criticized oil and gas assets -- I can tell you what they -- how they changed year-over-year. They're at, call it $6.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up $5.5 billion from -- so substantially, all migrated during the course of 2015.", "And in terms of second lien, it's a small number. We have a small business called Energy Capital that does some -- they're deeper in the capital stack investing and in our clients and in their properties. And I want to say the total portfolio is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So it's modest.", "John Stumpf", "Think of this is a senior lender, I mean--", "John Shrewsberry", "And the big E&P exposures are senior loan exposures.", "Kevin Barker", "What was the change of criticized, from third quarter to fourth quarter I meant?", "John Shrewsberry", "Let me see. It was 33% at the end of the third quarter and 38% at the end of the fourth quarter.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay. And then, in regards to some of the questions earlier about ancillary effects from the decline in oil prices, could in industrial, but then for even some financial institution exposure that you had in the commercial portfolio?", "John Shrewsberry", "So we have an ongoing analysis to look at it -- this is a related, but indirect response to that question. We have an ongoing analysis of all of the MSAs where we've got more than 5% -- well, there's two versions of it, so the 3% to 5% and then greater 5% employment in the energy industry and we're looking at all of our consumer and commercial exposures in those geographical areas to measure impact and to think about how we lend money, A, what our balance sheet exposure is and, B, what our new origination exposure looks like.", "And it might surprise you that places like Houston, because of their relative diversity of their overall economy are actually performing relatively stronger than some counties that represent other basins in the Dakotas, in the West, etcetera. But we really haven't seen any second order big impact yet among any of them, in terms of our balance sheet exposure and we're on the lookout. The entire credit organization here is focused on how that might change, but it really hasn't yet.", "And then, as John mentioned earlier, for most of our customers, 98% of our loans and most of our retail consumer customers and our wholesale customers, lower fuel costs mean lower transportation costs, mean lower heating costs, mean lower power costs. It's not bad for their business. They're impacted if their customers are employed in the business. They're impacted if they're selling into the business. But it's got a net stimulative effect. And so, we haven't seen a big spillover yet.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay. And then, right now, your charge-off rate is running in the low to mid 30s on basis points, whereas--", "John Shrewsberry", "Lowest on record at Wells Fargo, 33 basis points is as low -- we've looked in the--", "John Stumpf", "I've been here 34 years, I've never found it, never been lower.", "Kevin Barker", "Clearly, trends have been excellent for you guys over the last several years. And when we step back and look at, reserve releases have essentially stopped in the last two quarters. And pre-crisis, your charge-off rate was running around 70 to 80 basis points give or take, depending on the quarter and the year. But in looking at it now, how do you look at the migration or the normalization of credit where we're now versus pre-crisis?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. So we'll probably talk about this in some depth at our Investor Day and there are a couple important things and one of them is the mix of the assets on our balance sheet today, compared to where it used to be. So, home equity is sort of a going away business, because we've got a portfolio that's been shrinking for a long time. It's been improving in performance and it just is not being added for a variety of reasons on a net basis and that's unlikely to change.", "That was a big source of our absolute dollars of loss in the weighted average charge-off rate through the -- leading up to and through the crisis. When you think about the residential real estate portfolio here, what we're adding is all high-grade -- it's prime jumbo origination. They are very safe loans. I think we've got 4 basis points of loss, something like that coming through that portfolio. It feels very good. And while I'm sure it'll change a little bit over time, it's not going to behave like balance sheet first mortgage loans did pre-crisis, because there was just a different appetite for the types of loans that banks might hold.", "So I think that's important. Also the percentage of our portfolio and card business, we're trying to grow the credit card business. We like it a lot. It's obviously got a much more volatile charge-off profile to it, but at $30 billion, $40 billion or even $50 billion worth of assets at Wells Fargo, it's going to have -- if you are comparing us against other banks for example, that's going to have an impact. And I think those are a couple of the -- that contribution to mix is something that you need to have a sense for. And I think what you'll hear from us when we revisit this at Investor Day, is that our current expectation for our normalized through the cycle loss rate will be lower than the last time that we talked about it. But probably higher than 33 basis points, but lower than the 75 or whatever we signaled to you two years ago.", "John Stumpf", "And Kevin, I'll make one final comment. Virtually everything we do on the consumer side is prime. I mean, we have some near prime, 10% or so or less in auto and that's a bit of a difference from before. We had a Wells Fargo Financial in the past for example.", "Operator", "And I will now turn the conference over for any concluding remarks.", "John Stumpf", "Well, thank you for joining us. I want to thank all of our team members who serve one in three customers across the United States and so much appreciate all they do. Thank you for joining us and we'll see you in 90 days, three months from now. Bye, bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at Wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Our performance in the first quarter once again benefited from our diversified business model and our continued focus on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs. While the persistent low rate environment, market volatility and continued weakness in the oil and gas industry provided some near term headwinds, our long-term results continued to be driven by our focus on the real economy. For example, we are the largest lender in the U.S. and our loan and deposit balances are at an all-time high. ", "We continued to grow our customer base both organically and through acquisitions and February was the strongest month for retail bank household growth in five years. We worked to make every relationship, new and existing, a lasting one and our focus on providing outstanding customer service was recognized with Wells Fargo ranking number one in customer loyalty among large banks in the 2016 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index conducted by the firm Brand Keys. ", "Let me now highlight our results in the first quarter. We generated earnings of $5.5 billion and EPS of $0.99. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4% with growth in both the net interest income and non-interest income and our pre-tax pre-provision profit grew 5%. ", "Average loans grew $64 billion or 7% from a year ago. Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with average deposits up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5%. ", "While deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove a $200 million reserve build, the rest of our loan portfolio continued to have strong credit results with our total net charge-off rate remaining near historical lows at 38 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio. Our strong capital position enabled us to acquire assets from GE Capital and we returned $3 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter. ", "As you know, yesterday the Federal Reserve and FDIC announced their response to the 2015 resolution plan submitted by eight banks, including Wells Fargo. While we were disappointed to learn that our submission was determined to have deficiencies in certain areas, we are focused on fully addressing these issues as part of our 2016 submission. ", "Turning to the economic environment. While signs of economic uncertainty remain in the global economy as well as volatility in the capital markets, the U.S. economy, which is the primary driver of Wells Fargo's results, continues to be resilient. For example, while low energy prices have negatively impacted the oil and gas industry, the U.S. is still a net energy importer and the benefits of falling prices have outweighed the costs for consumers and most businesses. ", "Job creation in the U.S. remains robust with 2.7 million jobs added over the past year alone. Consumers have also benefited from low interest rates and modest borrowings. In fact, servicing financial obligations require just 15% of household income at the start of the year, more than a percentage point lower than the long term average and several percentage points lower than what the recession level was in late 2007. ", "The housing market continues to do well with steady gains in sales, construction and prices. This improvement has continued to benefit our consumer real estate portfolio where net charge-offs were down 41% from a year ago. Commercial real estate also remained strong with vacancy rates low in apartment, industrial and retail sectors and our CRE portfolio continued to generate net recoveries. ", "So while the start of 2016 has shown that the economic recovery remains slow and uneven, we remain focused on the long term drivers of our success, namely: increasing customers, loans, deposits and building capital. This unwavering focus on our diversified business model positions us well to benefit from future growth opportunities. ", "John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer will now provide more details on our first quarter results. John? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Thanks, John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions. ", "We had another quarter of solid results. We have now generated quarterly earnings of more than $5 billion for 14 consecutive quarters, one of only two companies in the country to do so, demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model and our consistent risk discipline. ", "While earnings declined from a year ago, our results in the first quarter last year included a discrete tax benefit of $359 million or $0.07 per share and a $100 million dollar reserve release. Our results this quarter included a number of noteworthy items. Our revenue benefited from the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business resulting in a $381 million gain recorded in all other non-interest income. ", "All other income also included $379 million of hedge ineffectiveness primarily on our own long-term debt hedges reflecting the impact of lower rates and foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter. We would expect the hedge ineffectiveness to be neutral to our results over the life of the hedge relationship but the impact in every quarter will vary. ", "We had a $124 million of other-than-temporary-impairment, OTTI, in our debt and equity securities related to oil and gas in the first quarter. The deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove the $200 million credit reserve build in the quarter also. I will get into more detail on oil and gas later in the call. ", "Expenses included $752 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. Our first quarter results also included the GE Capital acquisitions we completed during the quarter.", "On Page 4, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits.", "Turning to Page 5. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. Investment securities declined $12.7 billion from fourth quarter as we paused most of our purchase activity due to the volatility in the bond market. We had $5 billion of gross purchases during the first quarter compared with last year's average of $26 billion per quarter. ", "Long-term debt increased $28.4 billion with $23.8 billion of issuances, including $11 billion raised in advance of closing the GE Capital acquisitions. We also assumed $3.6 billion of debt from previous GE Capital securitizations. Short-term investments and Fed funds sold increased $30.4 billion reflecting growth in deposits, long term debt and our disciplined approach in managing liquidity and investment securities during the quarter.", "Turning to the income statement overview on Page 6. Revenue increased $609 million from the fourth quarter with growth in both net interest and non-interest income. I will highlight the drivers of this growth throughout the call.", "As shown on Page 7, we had continued strong loan growth in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and 3% from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans grew $31.6 billion from the fourth quarter, including $24.9 billion from the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. ", "Consumer loans declined $923 million from the fourth quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto and securities-based lending and student lending was more than offset by reductions in junior lien mortgage and seasonal declines in credit card. ", "Our total average loan yield increased 8 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the GE Capital acquisitions as well as the benefit of floating rate loan repricing. ", "We added a total of $30.8 billion of loans and leases from the GE capital acquisitions. The benefit of our strong balance sheet and industry expertise enabled us to add these high quality businesses, including talented new team members and valuable customer relationships. This is our largest acquisition since 2008. The integration is on track and we continue to expect it will be modestly accretive in 2016. ", "We completed the GE Railcar Services acquisition on January 1, which included $918 million of loans and interest earning leases and $3.2 billion of operating leases reported in other assets. Most of the revenue from this business is reflected in non-interest income as lease income. ", "On March 1, we acquired the North American-based portion of GE Capital C&I loans and leases which included $24 billion of loans and interest earning leases and $2.7 billion of operating leases. The remaining $2 billion of assets is expected to close in the second half of the year. The loans and leases we acquired were marked to fair value under the purchase method of accounting so that there was no associated allowance added as a result of these transactions. ", "Slide 9 highlights our broad-based loan growth. C&I loans were up $50.5 billion or 19% from a year ago driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $17.3 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans. ", "Commercial real estate loans grew $15.8 billion or 12% from a year ago, benefiting from the second quarter GE Capital acquisition and organic growth. Auto loans were up $4.3 billion or 8% from last year. We've consistently grown this portfolio in the upper single digits over the past year, reflecting the strong auto market while we have remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing. ", "Credit card balances were up $3.1 billion or 10% from a year ago, reflecting new accounts and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.7 billion or 8% from a year ago with growth in securities based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans.", "As highlighted on Page 10, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the first quarter, up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 10 basis points, up 1 basis point from a year ago and up 2 basis points from the fourth quarter. The slight increase in deposit cost reflected an increase in deposit pricing for some wholesale banking customers. We continue to believe that deposit betas will be lower during this rate cycle than they have been in past periods of rising rates, especially if the outlook for future rate increases remains uncertain.", "Page 11 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and non-interest income. We grew net interest income $79 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in earning assets, including the partial quarter impact from the assets acquired from GE Capital, the benefit from higher short-term rates and disciplined deposit pricing. These increases were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and loan fees and one less day in the quarter. ", "The net interest margin declined 2 basis points from the fourth quarter with lower variable income. All other growth and repricing were essentially neutral to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the first quarter by 6% from a year ago and continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full-year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 even if there are no additional rate increases.", "Total non-interest income increased $530 million from fourth quarter driven by the increase in all other non-interest income that I highlighted at the start of the call. The non-interest income also benefited from the increase in lease income related to the GE Capital acquisitions we completed in the quarter, which also included related lease depreciation expense. The linked quarter increase in trading gains was due to higher customer accommodation trading results across our markets businesses. The volatile markets we experienced in the first quarter impacted our trust and investment fees which declined $126 million from the fourth quarter. We also had lower debt and equity investment gains down $281 million from the fourth quarter. ", "While linked-quarter trends in deposit service charges and card fees were negatively impacted by seasonality, both of these fees grew 8% from a year ago driven by account growth. Mortgage banking revenue declined $62 million from the fourth quarter. Origination volume was $44 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality but purchase originations were up 13% from a year ago, reflecting a stronger housing market. ", "Applications were up 20% from the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter with a $39 billion application pipeline, up 34% from the fourth quarter. We expect origination volume to increase in the second quarter reflecting normal seasonality and strength in the housing market. ", "Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the first quarter, down 15 basis points from the fourth quarter due to a higher mix of correspondent originations in the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability declined $107 million from fourth quarter, which also contributed to lower production revenue. Servicing income increased $120 million from fourth quarter, from higher net MSR servicing hedge results and lower unreimbursed servicing costs. ", "As shown on Page 14, expenses increased $429 million from fourth quarter. As I highlighted at the start of the call, the increase was primarily driven by $752 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter. While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense reflecting annual merit increases which became effective late in the first quarter, and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter, such as outside professional services and advertising costs which are also expected to increase. We had $454 million of operating losses primarily driven by litigation expense in the first quarter. ", "Now that the FDIC has issued their final rule, I want to update you on the expected impact of the FDIC surcharge that I mentioned on our call last quarter, which is lower than we previously expected. We currently estimate that the surcharge along with a previously approved base rate reduction will increase our total FDIC assessment by approximately $100 million per quarter starting in the third quarter of 2016. Our efficiency ratio was 58.7% in the first quarter and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016. ", "Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 15. Community banking earned $3.3 billion in the first quarter, down 7% from a year ago due to the discrete tax benefit we had in the first quarter of 2015 and up 4% from the fourth quarter. We continued to successfully grow retail bank households and increased our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5% from a year ago. This growth along with increased usage and new product offerings benefited our debit and credit card businesses. ", "Debit card purchase volume was $72.4 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from a year ago, and credit card purchase volume was $17.5 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Customers are increasingly using our award winning digital offerings with digital active customers up 6% from a year ago, including 17.7 million mobile active users with continued double-digit growth in mobile adoption.", "Wholesale banking earned $1.9 billion in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago and down 9% from the fourth quarter. The decline was driven by the higher provision expense in our oil and gas portfolio. Revenue grew 6% from the fourth quarter with growth in both net interest and non-interest income. This growth was driven by the gain on the sale of our crop insurance business and the benefit of the GE Capital acquisitions. ", "Investment banking declined on overall market weakness and some of our commercial real estate related businesses had weaker results coming off a very strong fourth quarter performance. Loan growth remained strong driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $49.8 billion or 13% from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposit balances declined $3.7 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower international deposits from market volatility and the competitive rate environment. ", "Wealth and investment management earned $512 million in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago, down 14% from the fourth quarter. The year-over-year results reflect a strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 14% offset by the impact of weak equity market conditions on fee income. The decline in linked quarter results was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel costs. ", "Balance sheet growth remained strong with average deposits up 8% from a year ago and loans up 13%, the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth with continued growth in non-conforming mortgage loans and securities based lending. ", "We successfully completed our recruiting of financial advisors pursuant to our agreement with Credit Suisse. We were able to recruit substantially all of the advisors that we targeted. We are pleased with the success we've had recruiting these financial advisors and look forward to their contributions to our continued growth in wealth management.", "Turning to Page 18. Credit results continued to benefit from our diversified portfolio with only 38 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $55 million from the fourth quarter, including an increase of $87 million from our oil and gas portfolio. ", "While our oil and gas portfolio remains under stress due to low prices and excess leverage in the industry, the rest of our loan portfolios have performed well. Non-performing assets increased $706 million from the fourth quarter, we had $1.1 billion in higher oil and gas non-accruals and $343 million in nonaccrual loan from the GE Capital acquisitions which was within our acquisition underwriting assumptions. These increases were partially offset by lower residential and commercial real estate non-accruals and lower foreclosed assets. ", "As I mentioned earlier, we had a $200 million reserve build during the quarter as continued improvements in our residential real estate portfolio were more than offset by higher oil and gas reserves. Since first quarter 2015 we have released $1.8 billion of allowance that was allocated to our residential real estate portfolios while providing $1.4 billion of additional allowance allocated to our oil and gas portfolio, demonstrating the advantage of our diversified loan portfolio. The total allowance now stands at $12.7 billion. ", "Slide 19 highlights the characteristics of our oil and gas portfolio, which is less than 2% of total loans outstanding. We had $17.8 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, up $474 million from the fourth quarter, including $236 million in loans acquired from GE Capital. The remaining increase was driven by utilization of existing lines primarily in the E&P sector. The composition of our portfolio has remained relatively stable with 55% of our outstandings to the E&P sector, 21% to midstream and 24% to service companies. ", "Approximately 7% or $1.2 billion of our outstandings to investment grade companies based on public ratings. However there are other factors that are important to consider when assessing the quality of these loans. Our loans are primarily to middle market companies that we know well and have worked closely with across cycles. Of the approximately 100 bankruptcies that have occurred in the industry since the start of 2015, only eleven of our borrowers have filed during that time. ", "Our outstandings also included $819 million of second lien and $374 million of mezzanine loans. Our total oil and gas loan exposure which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding was down $1.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter with declines across all three sectors. This decline reflected reductions to existing credit facilities in part from spring redeterminations and net charge-offs. Approximately 34% of our unfunded commitments were to investment grade companies as their line utilization is generally lower. In addition to our exposure to oil and gas in our loan portfolio, we also had a total of $2.4 billion in our securities portfolio.", "Slide 20 highlights the credit performance of our oil and gas portfolio as we work through this cycle. The sector's performance has been driven by a number of factors that cumulatively have impacted loan quality. In addition to low oil and gas prices, cash flows and collateral values have been impacted by reduced production, run-off of hedges and limited additional cost levers. Reduced access to capital markets has also impacted borrowers\u2019 financial condition. As a result of these factors we had $204 million of net charge-offs in the first quarter. There were no losses from the midstream sector during the quarter.", "Non-accrual loans were $1.9 billion. We reviewed our loan portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and placed loans on non-accrual status when the full and timely collection of contractual interest or principal becomes uncertain, and loans are written down to net realizable value when appropriate.", "Approximately 90% of the non-accrual is recurrent on interest and principal. Payments received on these loans are applied to reducing principal which decreases future losses. Substantially all of our non-accrual loans are senior secured. ", "Given the conditions in the industry, criticized loans which include non-accrual loans increased 57% of the portfolio reflecting continued downward credit migration. This migration reflects changes in the borrower's financial condition. Reflecting the downward credit migration, our allocated allowance for the oil and gas portfolio increased $504 million to $1.7 billion. This portion of the allowance was 9.3% of total oil and gas loans outstanding. But as I've noted before, the entire $12.7 billion allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. ", "Turning to Slide 21. In addition to building allowance for our oil and gas portfolio, we continue to focus on other areas where the trends in the oil and gas industry may impact performance as we manage through the cycle. For example, we have assessed regions of the country and have been monitoring 15 regions in eight states where greater than 3% of employment is directly tied to oil production and are also monitoring performance in Houston and Alaska, neither of which have 3% of employment directly tied to oil production. ", "We're tracking changes in outstandings, utilization, delinquency rates, FICO scores and LTV migration across our consumer portfolios in these regions and having outperformed the rest of our portfolio for the past several years consumer delinquencies in oil dependent regions have increased and are roughly in line with the performance in non oil concentrated communities. We currently anticipate further deterioration and while we remain committed to serving our customers, we\u2019ve tightened our underwriting standards across our consumer portfolios in oil dependent regions. ", "We're also actively monitoring commercial real estate exposure on a loan-by-loan basis in geographies highly correlated to the oil and gas industry. Our CRE and energy management teams are working closely together and coordinating monitoring activities. Our total exposure is manageable and these loans are generally structured with significant cash equity and various other credit enhancements. ", "In summary, we are actively monitoring the impact from the disruption in the oil and gas industry in all areas of our business and we're working closely with all impacted customers. We've increased the size of our workout team and the senior members of our credit team are devoting significant time to monitoring our exposures. We've started the spring redeterminations and are decreasing borrowing bases. We\u2019re proactively reviewing credit agreements and modifying credit terms and commitment amounts accordingly. ", "While the level of losses we have in our oil and gas portfolio will continue to be impacted by the volatility and stress in the industry and it will take time to move through this part of the cycle, the experience of managing through many cycles will continue to be beneficial to our overall performance. ", "Turning to Page 22. Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity tier one ratio fully phased in at 10.6% in the first quarter, well above the regulatory minimum buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital generation positioned us to deploy capital for the assets acquired from GE while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. We issued 35.5 million common shares in the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher employee benefit plan activity. But we still reduced our common shares outstanding by 16.2 million shares through share repurchases of 51.7 million. Our net payout ratio was 60% in the first quarter.", "In summary, our first quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we continued to produce strong financial results in an environment that included some near-term headwinds. Our consistent focus on executing on our vision continued to benefit our fundamental drivers of long term growth, including adding customers, loans and deposits while maintaining our strong capital position. We look forward to providing you more details on the strength of our business model while highlighting the quality of our team at our investor day on May 24. John and I will now answer your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin ", "Just on the reserving and energy question -- thanks for the color John. So it seems like you've had a little bit more of the acceleration we've seen so far of those who have reported as far as the actual losses and the reserve build as well. How do we just get the understanding from here of the kind of pace of potential reserve additions? And then underneath that, are we effectively at the point where many benefits from lingering consumer reserve have kind of moved past? Thanks. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, on the second part of your question, it\u2019s tough to say. Now we\u2019re analyzing the reserve every quarter and to the extent that there's continued improvement in consumer real estate in particular, it\u2019s certainly possible that that produces incremental benefit that absorbs some of what's happening on the oil and gas side, that's been true for a while and it may continue to be true for a while. Housing -- housing has been strong and that doesn't feel likely to reverse course right now. But again we only know at the end of the quarter. ", "With respect to the pace or the trend of incremental reserving throughout the year. We're constantly reassessing borrower quality, we're doing a semi-annual borrowing base redetermination on E&P loans where we are in the middle of the spring redetermination period right now, call it 20%, 25% have been completed, so we'll have the rest of that information, that's name by name, capital structure by capital structure. So that will continue to inform things and we've definitely taken steps or -- for example, categorize loans as non-performing even if we haven't completed their spring redetermination. But my sense is there's more information there. So this is going to go on for a while. We\u2019re in the $40 context today, we were in the 30\u2019s for a while. Some of these capital structures just need to be restructured. That will take some time. And my assumption is that we're going to be talking about this all year. I don't know that we'll continue to reserve at this pace all year. Because we feel great about a reserve at the end of the first quarter and it reflects everything that we know. But I'd be hesitant to tell you that this was the big quarter, or this was the quarter, things will unfold as they're going to unfold depending on what happens with what prices, both spot and forward and the pace of restructurings of services and E&P companies. ", "John Stumpf", "Ken, to remind you that, I mentioned that residential real estate losses were down 41% year over year. And I think that sometimes goes a bit unnoticed. When we went into the downturn, we had over $100 billion of pick-a-pay loans and over $100 billion of home equity loans and those were the two toughest residential portfolios. Today those portfolios are less than half of what we started with and the performance is really really good. So there is a lot of momentum on that side that has been \u2013 that\u2019s happened over the last few years, but especially in the last year or two. ", "Ken Usdin ", "That's a fair point, John. Thanks for that. And just one follow up, on the redeterminations and the structuring, John, how far ahead can you get a redetermination? I get your point that we're only 25% through the spring. But have you already been able to get ahead of that just in terms of anticipation or you can only make those adjustments when we get there? And then also with the price back up, do we go into spring redetermination using a $40 plus starting point or do you still end up being much more punitive in terms of how you discount and how you redetermine? ", "John Stumpf", "Yes, I think that the price tag for this cycle is -- the front month is more in the mid 30s context. And it's a curve that you're using not just the spot price but we\u2019re probably 20% lower across our price deck curve in the spring versus where we were six months ago. And believe me that's not the only item that impacts the outcome. It's what's been going on with incremental exploration -- what are the reserves in terms of quantity and a variety of other things. But in terms of getting in front of it, as I said we're categorizing loans as non-performing. We're recognizing loss \u2013 these loss determinations, the $200 million that we've taken, that's our own credit folks determining that there is -- that there's something to be done, it\u2019s not as a result of a final resolution or a workout or the completion of a bankruptcy plan. And we can do that even before we've completed redetermination. So from an impact to Wells Fargo point of view, we're always trying to stay out in front of it. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.", "John McDonald ", "Hi, I'll switch it up. In terms of net interest income, John, how much have you benefited from the December hike in the first quarter? Have all the variable loans repriced and will there be additional pull through benefit from that December hike into the second quarter? ", "John Shrewsberry", "So our estimation is that we've gotten the full benefit of the December rate hike. The benefit on the asset side, the cost on the liability side, we talked about the impact on deposits which has been negligible. And so I think that's in the run rate at this point. ", "John McDonald ", "And then question for John Stumpf. What's the market like John for additional portfolio purchases? That's part one, and then part two is in terms of broader M&A, because of your size and favored nation status you're the kind of preferred name for news reporters and others that speculate on M&A for big financial companies, and since a lot's changed around the environment the last few years, can you just remind us your strategy around M&A, maybe how it's different than when you were smaller and how Dodd-Frank and Too Big To Fail might affect your view on acquisitions going forward? ", "John Stumpf", "Sure. As you probably know and those who know us well, 97% of the revenue we produce is from U.S. based customers, consumers, small business men and women, middle market large customers. And while we love our international business, it\u2019s mostly in support of our U.S. based businesses. And we have leadership positions in most of the businesses in which we do. And we don't set out to be number one, just to be number one. We work really hard and if we do really -- we provide great products and services and great value we grow because of that. ", "There's a couple of areas where we are sub-optimized that we are working hard to grow. One of those, I think the most attractive area would be the area that David Carroll runs in wealth investment management. You heard me say a number of times where we have 11% of the deposits or so in the country and just a fraction of that in terms of wealth assets here, even though we have a powerful wonderful group of leaders and advisors across the geography, we could still do a lot more business. There\u2019s a lot of our customers who call us their bank who have their wealth away. So we're working hard organically. That business has been growing double digits. If there was an opportunity to add something in that area that would make sense terrific. If there's not, that's also terrific. ", "On the consumer side, we have leadership in terms of distribution of our online activity, of our checking activity, or debit activity but not a credit card activity even though we've grown that significantly internally, about over 43% of our customers who have their primary account here have a credit card. But that's an area that, that would be opportunistic. We've been doing a great job organically, if there\u2019d be some opportunities along the line that would make sense we would surely consider that. But I would think of it this way, John. I would think of it that we have all that we need right now. And if something became available that we thought would be a bolt on, that would help us in those areas specifically but other areas generally, sure we\u2019d look at that. But that's our focus right now, our best opportunity to grow long term shareholder values here, value creation is doing more or just doing it better. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR & Company.", "Paul Miller ", "A lot of clients, a lot of questions that I have been getting is that yeah, energy, a lot of people might be reserved good for energy, but the second or third derivative of energy was a lot of the growth of this economy over the last year or two, and since energy is starting to struggle, that the economy's got in a recession, I know you've heard of it. But what are you seeing on the second and third derivatives on the credit book? Are you seeing any real deterioration in CRE markets in some of these areas like Texas where probably energy is hitting the hardest? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. Well, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks in the consumer portfolios, all of them were growing, MSA by MSA and comparing the performance of our borrowers in the areas that are highly levered to energy. That the greater than 3% employment is one measure that we use but we've also included Houston for example to your point about Texas being hard hit even though it doesn't qualify with the 3% employment trigger. And what we've discovered is those areas have been performing better than average for a long time, no surprise, because that's where all the growth has been coming from and they're starting to look more average. So whether it's measures of delinquency, in some cases measures of LTV based on what's changing in asset values, they look a little bit more average. So it doesn't feel like it\u2019s a at least at this point that it's another shoe to drop in the short term. But as you expect less employment, people will \u2013 loans will perform differently. ", "In commercial real estate, which is where we have a big presence, we've recently done a deep dive in Texas in particular. And office vacancies are somewhat higher in the Houston area, no surprise, I think about 20% including sublease space. Multifamily is a little bit weaker. And so we're looking at that first and foremost frankly with respect to what it means to our risk, to our own portfolio and we feel fine about what our exposures are there. But those are things that those regions are going to have to grapple with. So when it comes to growth rates or people who have more concentrated exposures than that, that probably is the first second order what people are going to have to look out for. More broadly speaking, I think we still feel we're in a 2% environment. There are obvious pockets of strength around the country but when you move out of oil and gas, we're in the same low growth, better consumer, strong employment environment that we've been operating in for a couple of years, not enough to make it feel like rates are going to move as a result of it but not enough to feel like we're stalling either. ", "John Stumpf ", "Paul, if I can just give you an anecdotal. I lived in Texas for six years in the mid to late 90\u2019s, so 20 years ago and there was a period of time there -- there was volatility in the oil and gas space. And there was some challenges. And I've been back, I was just in Houston last week. And I've been back a number of times in the last year and things do feel different 20 years later. It's a much more diverse economy. And if you take Texas generally but Houston specifically and it feels different this time around. Downturns are always heard. Volatile markets always have an impact. But this feels different this time because of what the state has done to diversify their economy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. ", "Erika Najarian ", "So my first question is actually a follow-up to John\u2019s question. My conversations with investors have often paired well just to be frank with either large credit card companies or there is clearly the rumor for Wells potentially buying a large investment bank which you formally denied. As we think about what you were saying, John, about looking at bolt-on opportunities, should we think about the deal size as sizes that are manageable enough that maybe sort of \u2013 the real stop here is Wells Fargo not moving up the SIFI surcharge? As we think about the opportunity for non-organic growth, should we think about sort of the hard stop in terms of size being that, you would like to keep your SIFI surcharge where it is today?", "John Stumpf ", "Erika, here's how I think about it. I think about Wells Fargo as an organic growth company. We have -- I've been here almost 35 years and I have probably been involved in \u2013 if there\u2019s 250 acquisitions we've done with all different companies, as we come to the modern Wells Fargo, I\u2019ve probably been involved in half of those, just because it happened during my career time. And they're hard to do. There is a lot of work in those things and we now have a company that is the best company I have ever worked for, the strongest brand, the best people, the furthest reach, the deepest relationship, the long enduring customer, thing so. So \u2013 and we are very very careful buyers. And I see us as has a lot of opportunity to grow, as I said organically. If something -- and what we've done in the last four or five years have been largely bolt on, I would say GE was a bigger, a little bigger bolt-on. But those are the kind of opportunistic things that make sense for our team, for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders. After all this is your money, our investors' money that we are the stewards of. ", "So it would be out of character for us to do something that would be -- have a high degree of risk and a low degree of shareholder reward on it. That's just not who we are. ", "Erika Najarian ", "Thank you, John, that was very clear. My second question is just looking to capital return, since you have been CCAR participant, it seems like your GAAP earnings volatility is the least among your large peers. As we look forward -- obviously you can't tell us about this year\u2019s CCAR submission -- but as you look forward, how are you feeling about potentially continuing to push on that 30% dividend \u2013 implicit dividend ceiling?", "John Stumpf ", "It's hard to comment on that during the middle of the CCAR cycle. But I admire you for asking. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matt O'Connor ", "I just want to delve into a couple of potential earnings levers going forward. I guess the first one would be, as we think about the liquidity that you've built, since you chose not to reinvest as much in the securities book, how are you thinking about that pool of funds going forward and there's not really any signs that rates are going to rise materially as we think about market rates, we\u2019re obviously off the bottom. But what's your approach to managing that liquidity from here?", "John Shrewsberry", "So it will be informed week by week, quarter by quarter as we assess the likelihood of increases in both short and consequently long term rates. We won\u2019t sit idly on continuous increases in cash forever. We're going to have to put some of it to work, we\u2019re very cautious about what it means entering at these levels in terms of capital impact in the future, if a subsequent rate rise does occur that's obviously a big issue for us. And we'd like to be smart about our entry points. But if we're going to hover in the 170s, just to pick a number on the ten year and with mortgage rates where they are, then there will be some amount of redeployment. We\u2019ll probably talk about it a little bit more at investor day. But it was really the abrupt market volatility that happened after the first of the year that caused us to say, let's take a pause here and figure out where this is going to settle out. It's happened to have settled out not much above the low points, at least again on a ten-year from January, early February. But that is an earnings lever when and if we redeploy.", "Matt O'Connor ", "And then just separately on the expenses, maybe just talk about \u2013 is there any kind of change or even tweak on the approach to expense management given maybe weaker revenues and some of the ongoing pressures in energy likely lingering? ", "John Stumpf", "There is a continuous drumbeat and a high level of vigilance around how we spend all of our business as usual types of dollars, we\u2019re constantly trying to find levers and ways to be more efficient to streamline to make things consistent. We've provided some examples of that in the past in certain areas there. At the same time we've talked about the investment that we're making in technology, the investments that we\u2019re making in product capability, the investments that we\u2019re making in risk management compliance and being a better firm. Those are going to be elevated for some time and they have been for some time. We're still comfortable in our 55% to 59% range which is where we've guided that, I don't need to remind you but that is a very attractive level for a firm of our size. We think we're pretty lean overall. But it's because we take this seriously day in and day out looking for ways to be efficient. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. ", "Bill Carcache ", "Thank you. Good morning. Of your borrowers who drew on their oil and gas lines this quarter, was there any notable deterioration in their credit profile? I was just trying to understand the extent to which heightened degrees of financial stress is a factor, leading your borrowers to draw down their lines. And although you mentioned that your current reserve reflects everything that you currently know today. I was wondering how you're thinking about the probability that more and more of your unfunded exposure will eventually become funded as we move deeper into the credit cycle? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure, that's a good question, and of course we absolutely have to make estimates about what we think the exposure at default would be for any borrower who's got a remaining unfunded commitment, that's how the process works. In the quarter there were some of these, what you might characterize as defensive draws that we've observed, not that many of them. You can see the increase in the total outstandings in oil and gas rose by about $400 million and about half of that was from frankly leases that we picked up from GE that have a credit mark in them incidentally. So it really didn't amount to that much. But it is a phenomenon that we've seen, that we've read about. It isn't having that big of an impact today but we do think that we're capturing that risk as we assess what the appropriate size is of our allowance for both funded and unfunded commitments in the space. ", "Bill Carcache ", "So when I guess a previously unfunded energy loan commitment becomes funded, how does that transition from unfunded -- funded impact your allowance, I guess I think generally the reserve rate on unfunded commitment is lower than it is on funded commitments but just trying to understand the reserving dynamics there of shifting from one bucket to the other? ", "John Shrewsberry", "So in the calculation of the allowance and the migration of credit that leads up to our \u2013 whether we consider a borrower relationship to be non-performing or what status we're marking at, we're imagining on a credit by credit basis what the exposure at default would be if it is meaning that it could be greater than the currently outstanding amount. That's part of the loan by loan process, analysis by analysis that we do when building it -- when rewriting loans every quarter and building up for the allowance. So there's some estimation of what today is currently unfunded will become funded in the future.", "Bill Carcache ", "Thank you, and if I can just ask a final follow up. Can you discuss the methodology underlying your energy reserve, is it based more on the ability of borrowers to repay their loans through cash flow generation or is it more a kind of reliant on collateral coverage based on reserves in the ground? There are some reports suggesting that regulators are less happy with collateral coverage and I was wondering if you could kind of speak specifically to the approach that Wells Fargo has taken? ", "John Stumpf", "Well, it's a combination of both. And they're highly correlated for E&P companies in particular. But if their sources of repayment both principal and interest in full and on time and we\u2019re taking into account our projections of their cash flows, and we're taking into account our projections of the value of collateral that we might have to liquidate in order to get paid back or that they might have to liquidate in order to pay us back. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin Barker ", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to switch gears here and look at your auto exposure. You're obviously one of the largest auto lenders in the country and you\u2019re growing that portfolio by roughly 30% over the last three years. Given what we've seen in the industry and some deterioration in the subprime portfolios, could you help us get an understanding of what your expectations are through the rest of this year and into 2017 given the state of the auto industry and how hot it\u2019s been over the last couple of years?", "John Stumpf", "Sure. Well, we\u2019ve \u2013 I think we've been pretty public with the fact that we're going to hold our ground with respect to what we think our quality loan terms and borrower profile, and we've actually seen our share slip a little bit as the overall size of the auto finance market has kept pace with the sale of autos, new cars in particular that has been at a record level now for a few years. And we were number one, I think we're number two right now and we\u2019re bidding on buying the loans that we like at terms that we think are good risk reward and we're passing on those that we don\u2019t. Some of the things that feel a little bit different right now, I mean seasonally obviously we're in a better place in Q1 than Q4 just because those loans behave that way, collections and losses are lower in the first quarter than they are in the fourth quarter. It's a little bit -- things are a little bit elevated first quarter to first quarter but we're still from a risk adjusted basis well within the bands to which we underwrite each level of credit risk in autos that we buy. Where we've always had our eye on the elevated level of used car auction prices, the Manheim Index in particular is evidence that we point to get a sense for whether loss given default is going to be worse in the future than it is today or in the recent past and that index has been down I think 3% linked quarter, 2% year over year. So all things being equal we'd expect severity to be a little bit worse when repossessions occur. ", "But having said that we're still not in a bad place. We've allowed our market leading position to slip a little bit, let other people buy the loans that don't make sense for us, it\u2019s still a great business for us and has been for a long time. We work very closely with dealers, have a big floor plan business, we have a big commercial banking business with the dealership community. And we're in this for the long haul. One more thing I guess, we've observed is because the ABS market has been under pressure, some of the probably most aggressive players in the subprime space have a little bit of a funding challenge I think in this environment that may soften things up a little bit. Those are my current observations. ", "Kevin Barker ", "So just to follow up on that, I mean, are you seeing better risk adjusted returns in sub prime auto versus prime auto right now and are you growing the subprime auto portfolio at effective rate?", "John Stumpf", "We've sort of held the line. Using our own approach to what a subprime borrower and sub-prime dealer is we've limited ourselves to at about 10% of our originations which is amounted to about 10% of our outstandings that we\u2019d consider to be -- we consider to be subprime. There's often an opportunity to grow that if we wanted to, we've chosen not to. And we like the risk return that we get in where we choose to participate in that space. It's performed very well. It's priced for the risk and it frankly doesn't compete directly with some of the specialty finance companies that are in that space, they tend to be a little bit deeper and they're running a different business. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital. ", "Joe Morford ", "I guess, first, just a quick follow up on Ken\u2019s question at the outset. Just I was curious how much the increased oil and gas reserving a provision this quarter can be attributed to the shared national credit exam. ", "John Stumpf", "I\u2019d say very little. And the exam came and went and it worked out fine, there weren\u2019t a lot of disagreements on how we rate loans and also the guidance around leverage levels et cetera was introduced and that didn't have much of an impact on it. This is just \u2013 these are our folks using consistent methodology making determinations on when loans should be non-performing, when we should take loss et cetera. ", "Joe Morford ", "That's very helpful, thanks. I guess the other question was just, wondering if you could talk a bit more about the \u2013 how the GE Capital business integrations are going and how are you feeling currently about the potential for cross selling or revenue synergies. And also just wondering if you can quantify the impact we may see in the second quarter from a full run rate of expenses? ", "John Stumpf", "I like the first part of the question better. But it is a big opportunity. So this is early stages, this is an important and big integration. So It'll take a full year or two to get where we need to go into transition all of the services away from GE and over to Wells Fargo and get things running. I'm happy to say that the early reports are that we're doing great with customers and team members. I think we imagine that there's a real opportunity with these customers. These are businesses where GE has been an absolute leader and they've done that with credit. So now we've got that credit capability and that credit willingness and the perfect business model for that but we also have all of the other. wholesale banking products and services, wealth management services et cetera to bring to bear on this client group. So it will take a while to work with each relationship and find out what they're doing that might be done at Wells Fargo in addition to their credit but my sense is it will be a great adoption over time and that's part of what makes it such a high value opportunity for Wells Fargo.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.", "John Pancari ", "Just a couple more questions on energy and then on expenses. On energy, what percentage of that 1.2 billion in second lien exposure that you provided is nonperforming; do you have that? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yeah. Let's see. $113 million of the combined second lien and mezzanine, it today is categorized as non-accrual.", "John Pancari ", "And what is your energy criticized ratio as of March 31? I know last quarter it was 38% approximately. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yeah. It's 57% now. And that reflects the environment that we\u2019re in, that reflects what's going on with the stress of the borrowers, that's what -- that migration is what leads us to provide more reserve. ", "John Pancari ", "And then through the 25% of the spring redeterminations that you completed, what's been the average reduction in borrowing base that you have seen?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, so I guess I'd start by saying that 50%, 60% have actually had a reduction in the borrowing base. A quarter had no change in the borrowing base. And the balance actually had an increase in the borrowing base because of more reserves that were included in the borrowing base. But without getting too specific on the amount of the reserve for people who had a reduction, it was relatively significant and frankly reflected the curve that we're using today versus where we would have been a quarter ago. ", "John Pancari ", "And then lastly on the expense side, could you just give us a little more color on, why the incentive comp increases much as it did this quarter particularly on the backdrop of some of the revenue hedging? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yeah, it's not really incentive comp so much. It\u2019s -- think about FICA resetting in the first quarter, contributions to our 401(k) happened in the first quarter. And then for people who are retirement eligible -- there's lots of people at Wells Fargo who get an annual equity incentive as part of their pay, for most people it vests over a few years and the impact bleeds in over the vesting period. If you're already retirement eligible it all hits in the quarter that is granted because it's immediately vested. And that's why the first quarter has that extra impact. It's not so much about -- commissions and incentives are piece of it but it's just -- it reflects the actual business activity that's happening.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck ", "Couple questions, one and I'll get the energy one out of the way first. So I think you mentioned 25% of your loans went through the redeterminations process in the quarter; is that right? ", "John Shrewsberry", "That\u2019s just where we happen to be to date for the spring redetermination, the rest of them are underway. It's a borrower by borrower analysis. ", "Betsy Graseck ", "So as of the ones that were finished during the quarter, how much incremental reserve was required? Is that what drove the reserve up? ", "John Shrewsberry", "What drives the reserve up is our categorization of the loan as -- generally speaking as non-accrual or non-performing, meaning that we think there's a chance that we won't get full and timely repayment of every dollar of principal and interest. That can certainly come about in connection with the redetermination but it can come about for other reasons as well just in terms of our review of the company's overall performance, the value of their collateral, what their prospects are. So it's not really a linear \u2013 but you can't really draw a line between the redetermination specifically and the change in reserves. ", "Betsy Graseck ", "It could have some impact but \u2013 ", "John Shrewsberry", "It would definitely have an impact, if we reduce somebody\u2019s availability and if they were drawn above their availability and we actually had a moment of reckoning where they had to write a check, that will accelerate that analysis, because they will have something that they have to do right then and there. There aren't that many instances of that. ", "Betsy Graseck ", "It's just that as we go through the rest of the 75% of redetermination for the spring, that could drive some more expense reserve requirements. ", "John Shrewsberry", "It could. I mean it could. We capture a lot of that in our general assessment in our risk rating before having the actual results of the redetermination. But it certainly could. ", "Betsy Graseck ", "And then just a question on recent balance sheet. So you brought down Fed funds a bit, is that right? ", "John Shrewsberry", "We\u2019re up. We were $30 billion higher in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter because we were less active in the bond market. ", "Betsy Graseck ", "And that was mostly because of your view on rates and where you wanted to reinvest? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. ", "Betsy Graseck ", "So a 25 bp increase in rates today, are you in a more asset sensitive position now because of that? ", "John Shrewsberry", "I think that's right. ", "Betsy Graseck ", "Any sizing or \u2013 ", "John Shrewsberry", "No, we are more asset sensitive as a result. We also have more long term debt that came under in the quarter. So there's a handful of things going on at the same time. But at the margin we're probably a little bit more asset sensitive. ", "Betsy Graseck ", "And then on the redeployment into securities, I know, you might want to have a higher rate to redeploy into, but is there a point where you say you know what, I wanted to but it's been 17 for five, six, seven, eight months whatever it is, I am going to start to redeploy some of my cash into longer duration paper. I mean, can you just give us a sense as to how you think about? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, that is the discussion that we're having it regularly in our ALCO meetings with the board et cetera. My sense is that in this low rate environment we\u2019d probably not go as far out in terms of duration so that we were taking less capital risk even though the dollar for dollar return would be a little bit lower. But it's the tradeoff between foregone earnings, capital sensitivity and a handful of other things that we're having to assess and we're doing it with our best estimate of where we think rates are going and what happens if they don't go there. And so the long and the short of it is I don't think that we're going to continue to build cash balances like we did in the first quarter. But we know we're reassessing every day to make a determination on at what entry point and at what point in the curve we\u2019re interested in putting on more duration risk.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Mike Mayo ", "Hi, how much did the GE acquisitions add to EPS this quarter and what do you expect it to add for the rest of the year? ", "John Shrewsberry", "So we're not breaking out what it added during the quarter. And what we're saying is we think it will be modestly accretive for the rest of the year. And it really is about what it costs to transition people, technology, premises etc. throughout the remainder of the year. We'll update that as we move along and we've got more information about how those costs are actually coming in and being spent. But I\u2019ll tell you that the average asset yield for those assets reflects the same kind of loan mix that we have in wholesale banking in general and the expectation once it's -- once they're fully integrated and we've finished our process is that they will carry the same type of efficiency ratio as the average wholesale lending business. ", "John Stumpf", "Actually Mike, in the first quarter it was a little bit of -- couple moving parts here, we actually, if you will, pre-funded the liability side, meaning that we've raised the debt to fund this and that was on the books at the start of the quarter and most of the loans only came on March 1. So there's a lot of stuff going on in the first quarter. But there's one month worth of really revenue if you will.", "Mike Mayo ", "So three months of funding, one month of revenues, so you'll see the full benefit in the second quarter. I was just wondering if you could size that a little bit more. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, we're talking about $30-ish billion worth of assets and the same type of loan yields that we have on average in wholesale, which gets you to a revenue number. What we're not specifically breaking out is what the expense impact is until we understand what the full integration expenses are. But you'll see $350 million per quarter of NII from the loans and leases themselves. ", "Mike Mayo ", "And how much of that did you have in the first quarter, the $350 million? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, so as John said we had one month of the revenue side of it. We had not quite three months worth of the funding cost because we weren\u2019t fully funded for those three months. But more than one month's worth of funding costs about that. ", "Mike Mayo ", "And then separately, John, did I hear you correctly, you said benefits of falling oil prices offset the costs. I think you said that at the start of the call. ", "John Stumpf", "Yeah, I said -- since we're still a net importer of energy and what's interesting, Mike, is that much of that savings at the consumer level have been saved, if you will, and have not yet been spent. So not all the savings at the pump. What consumers have done and that not exclusively but they're saving more of that what's happening at the pump as opposed to spending it.", "Mike Mayo ", "And how do you see that? In other words, when oil prices go down, the stock market declines, bank stocks sell off. And you're saying the market's wrong with that. What do you see in your business that you think maybe the market has wrong in how they think about oil prices? ", "John Stumpf", "I don't \u2013 I have long stopped trying to figure out the market and why bank stocks or stocks seem to move in concert with commodity prices especially oil prices but be that as it may, the consumer, much of this economy, 60%, 70% is consumer based and in retail and the consumers have never been in better shape. I mentioned in my comments just the debt service requirements is 15% of their earnings and wage is certain of up a little that and we're seeing savings rates go up. These are some of the strongest savings rates we've seen in some time. I don't know if that\u2019s a statement about confidence or whatever but there is -- consumers are benefiting from filling your tank at the dollar something a gallon or two dollars a gallon versus three or four and not all of it has been spent.", "Mike Mayo ", "And then the last question, just give us a sneak preview of the investor conference. What do you hope to achieve at the investor conference and do you think you will have a director show up again at?", "John Stumpf", "Well, thank you Mike for reminding everybody that Steve Sanger, our lead director showed up last time. Obviously we invite our directors and just give me a chance to invite all of you. It's on the 24th of next month, it\u2019s a Tuesday. We have an exciting day to share with you. We will get very granular about how we think about distribution, how we think about our businesses. It will give us a chance to showcase next generation leaders in the company. So we're looking forward to it. We also will think about Guardrails around our three big metrics, we talk about ROA, ROE, and efficiency ratio, if I talk about that, so it's a bunch of things. And also everybody talks about FIN Tax and clearly there's a good reason for that. I think our company specifically and our industry generally have been innovators for a whole long time. So if we weren't we'd have stagecoaches on the freeway right now. So we\u2019ll talk a little bit about that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.", "Eric Wasserstrom ", "There's been some recent media attention to the buildout you've been doing in some of your advisory and capital markets capacities. And I'm wondering what your -- how you view that now in light of course the broader marketplace for those services which may be under some pressure and then also the fact that your exposure specifically to the energy industry within those business lines is a bit higher than peers. Is that changing your interest in investment in those areas? ", "John Stumpf", "Not really. The pattern has been the same since the merger of Wells and Wachovia to make sure that we've got the right level of capability for capital raising and advisory activity and hedging and risk management activity for our corporate and commercial customers and other customers of Well Fargo who need it. We think our risks are well sized, we think our capabilities are well sized. As always, as you point out there are things to add here and there but from a return point of view, from an ability to service our customers point of view, we like the trajectory we've taken. That's why it's so easy to respond pretty quickly when people speculate that we might be thinking about adding an investment bank to our mix or something. That's not what we need. What we need is what we have today and more great people like it to serve more customers but we're not thinking much differently about it. Our results frankly were -- we think they're pretty good in the first quarter. As you say we have been a leader in capital raising and advisory work for the energy industry for a while. There will be plenty more need for that as the industry repairs itself and being in a position to provide that is actually it's good for us. ", "We've got industry leading positions in a handful of other industries as well, energy is just one of them. But like others it's a cyclical business and while there is less capital raising going on there right now there's more going on in other spaces and a lot of advisory work to do. So it fits together very nicely with our wholesale bank. ", "Eric Wasserstrom ", "And is your intent to continue to add personnel into those business lines? ", "John Stumpf", "Yes I think so. We're always -- we're always \u2013 as I say industries come and go with respect to their capital needs and advisory needs and so we want to make sure that we've got the right people in positions to do the right thing, where we become an employer of choice for a lots of those activities. Wells Fargo is a very nice place to work. We've got a great customer franchise who wouldn't want to work here in those businesses compared to some of the places that they might be coming from and we're always adding good people. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. ", "Nancy Bush ", "And John, it kind of got lost in the hoopla yesterday about the living wills. But there was a Reuters news item that says Wells Fargo has become significantly more important to the health of the global financial system in the past few years, says a report by the office of financial research. And it strikes me with what came out in the resolution letters yesterday that maybe being too important to the global financial system may not be an entirely good thing. And I'm wondering if you feel at this point that your growth or lines of business your plans for those might be impacted by these findings. ", "John Shrewsberry", "So Nancy, we went and looked at that report after that wacky headline hit the cave and. And it reported the same thing it reported a year ago which is that we're number seventeen among GSIBs in the lowest risk category among globally systemically important banks. So there's no basis for that story. We are a big bank, we are globally systemically important and we're used to being measured. But we ended up toward the bottom of that list. So that was a funny conclusion that was drawn. ", "With respect to the feedback that we got in the living wills. There are some actionable things that we're going to get right on. But there's nothing about size, about complexity, about the nature of our business model, about our capital, about our liquidity. And really it was much more around proper governance and maturation of the process et cetera which are things that are addressable. So frankly I don't think we're being criticized by our regulators for the types of things that work their way into the financial press. ", "John Stumpf", "But surely we're disappointed in the resolve and all hands on deck here and we value the feedback we got from the Fed and FDIC and we are committed to have a great submission later this year. Nancy, one thing I would like just to share for a few minutes, even though our company has grown and grown significantly organically, principally organically over the last seven or eight years, we have continued to simplify our business and we're \u2013 and we've shed businesses quietly that either didn't have scale for us or provided or had a risk reward relationship that was not consistent. So just let me just check off a few, I was just thinking while John was talking. We're no longer in the wholesale mortgage business. We're not in the joint venture business. We're not in the reverse mortgage business. We're not in the mortgage consolidation business. We have FHA overlays. So we're not as deep in that business as we had been in the past. We just sold our RCIS insurance business. The direct deposit advance business is no longer here. We're not in the government student lending business. We use it at our Wells Fargo financial business, that it's very different today. ", "So yes we've grown in deposits. And we've grown in our corporate loans and all and wealth management and all other kind of things that we're involved in but a much simpler company, say, in many respects. ", "Nancy Bush ", "Now that you've \u2013 if I may ask, you've sort of opened up the living will issue and if I may ask if there are any of this feedback that you got yesterday that you feel is related to residual issues that are left over from the Wachovia deal. And I think I will just say that as an analyst it was no great secret in the industry that they were not the best on the reporting side. Are there any tasks left undone that were related to that merger that may have played into your feedback yesterday? ", "John Stumpf", "No, we own this and we're going to get this right.", "Nancy Bush ", "If I could ask a totally unrelated question, home equity lines of credit seem to be coming back into favor both at the banks and among consumers. Can you just speak to that business? You've always been important in it. Is it growing now and how do you feel about it?", "John Shrewsberry", "Because of the starting point that Wells Fargo has had the numbers have really only been going in one direction, which is down, down, down. The product that we have today where we do sell it is an amortizing product right out of the gate, so it's very different than it was in the old days where it was more just incremental leverage, that frankly didn't come down until it might hit some amortization point in the future. So we certainly offer that amortizing product to our customers. But I don't think you'll see it make a difference in our reported consumer real estate assets. Really on our balance sheet it\u2019s more about prime jumbo and non-conforming by balance types of loans to prime borrowers. ", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.", "Marty Mosby ", "Thanks. John, I've done a little bit of the math when you look at the cost of the liabilities on the GE and then the delay in the assets. It looks like from a net NII standpoint you pick up close to $200 million as you move into next quarter just from the balance sheet side. Just trying to piece it together best I could. Was there any timing effect on the expenses? So as you came in and brought the operations on board, did you have a pretty full run rate on the expense side versus next quarter? That is my real question, is there any also leverage in a sense that the expenses were already kind of in place for this quarter going into next quarter? ", "John Shrewsberry", "The big expenses it\u2019s related are people expenses. The people join -- the bulk of the people joined on March 1, so in the last month of the quarter, there are some people in the rail business that joined at the beginning of the year. Another meaningful expense will be depreciation expense on the lease assets that we're picking up and they come out of that -- that begins when the assets are in place. But importantly one of the reasons that we're describing this as modestly accretive in the year, is there's a whole lot of integration expense that needs to occur, including what we're paying for transition services that we're still getting from GE that will shift over to Wells Fargo at some point in the future \u2013 or very different points in the future. And then there's technology work to do. There's some loan file work to do, some paperwork to do, there's a lot of things that it takes to make all of those assets Wells Fargo assets in a regulated environment that we\u2019re operating in and we will pay incremental dollars in the near term to do that. So I\u2019d be hesitant to offer you up a run rate from March that reflects what Q2 or the rest of the year is going to look like. ", "Marty Mosby ", "Would you be, on the expense side, isolating those as integration costs so we can know, not the total, but just as integration like you would do with any other kind of merger? And when we look at the seasonal uptick that we have in those employee-related expenses, typically you don't see a net benefit as it goes down because there's other expenses that offset that. But would you expect in the core expenses to see somewhat of a roll-down, given how high the seasonal expenses were this first quarter? Just two things on that side. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yeah. Well, I expect that it will be between 55% and 59% in our efficiency ratio for the rest of the year on the high side of that. And that would capture the change in seasonal expenses, it's a good point that not all of that seasonal comp expense disappears and the whole net benefit doesn't come back, we call out in our deck. But there are some other things that are seasonally depressed in the first quarter that pick up in the second quarter. Not as big but that are seasonal in that way. And we'll see how material it is but if it becomes appropriate to provide clarity on the GE transition related expenses you might consider calling that out. But we haven't begun to yet because we're still developing those expenses, we\u2019re still coming into -- we're the early stage of execution on some of the technology oriented things that I mentioned and some other chunky early expenses that will start to run off after a bit. ", "Marty Mosby ", "John, lastly trying to climb into your head a little bit, as you were looking at the first quarter and you had the gain from selling the crop insurance business and rates were going down and you had so much market disruption, were you kind of thinking, since I have this gain over here, I don't really feel comfortable putting my liquidity to work because of what\u2019s going on in the market. That gives me some breathing room to see where things fall and then start reinvesting in the second quarter, recreating the income that you gave up in the first quarter. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Investing in risk \u2013 in relatively risk free assets doesn't produce that much P&L in the quarter that we invest. So there really wasn't much of a trade off in the first quarter between the gain that reflects this business that we agreed to sell a few quarters ago, that closed this quarter. It's really -- the threshold issues on reinvestment are more around our capital sensitivity because we're going to be living with the valuation consequences of buying duration at a low yield entry point. And then that really is more where the trade off occurred. So thinking about the whole year impact maybe on interest income but also our OCI sensitivity if rates ultimately back up. ", "End of Q&A", "John Stumpf", "Okay, thank you all for joining us and also I want to say thank you to our 268,000 team members for serving our customers and producing a $5.5 billion of quarterly earnings that it\u2019s just a wonderful result on their behalf. And one more shout out to all of you. Please join us on the 24th, Tuesday -- May 24 in San Francisco for our investor day. Thank you much.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remark there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin the conference.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. Please remember that this call is being recorded.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.", "Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you Jim, good morning and thank you for joining us today. Our diversified business model and continued focus on meeting our customer's financial needs drove our performance in the second quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. We produced strong performance during a period that has had - has included persistent low rates, market volatility and economic volatility, and we did it by focusing on the core building blocks of long-term shareholder value creation, that is growing relationships, loans, investments and deposits. Our loan and investment, and deposit balances are all at record levels and we've maintain our strong risk discipline. Let me highlight our results for the second quarter. We generated earnings of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.01. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4%, with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income, and our pre-tax pre-provision profit grew 5%. We generated positive operating leverage, while we continued to make investments throughout our businesses.", "Average loans grew over $80 billion or 9% from a year ago. Average deposits increased $51.4 billion or 4% from year ago and we grew the primary - the number of primary consumer checking customers by 4.7%. Net charge offs remained near historical lows at 39 basis points annualized reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio and continued underwriting discipline. We returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the second quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of returning more than $3 billion. We continue to increase stockholder\u2019s equity which now exceeded $200 billion for the first time and we are pleased to have received a non-objection to our 2016 capital plan from the Federal Reserve. Incidentally, when the former Norwest, which when I came from and Wells Fargo merged 18 years ago, our total assets at the time were slightly less than $200 billion, now our stockholders\u2019 equity exceeds that. Remarkable results over that period of time.", "Turning to the economic environment, Brexit has added to global economic uncertainty and could result in rates remaining lower for even longer than expected putting pressure on reinvestment opportunities. However, compared to our large bank peers, it should have a much lower direct impact on our long-term business drivers because as you know we are largely a US centric company and many indicators point to continued relative strength in the US economy. After a couple of lackluster quarters, we estimate real GDP grew at 2.5% rate in the second quarter, up from 1.1% in the first quarter. Most of the improvement came from consumers where drivers were broad-based. Spending on big ticket items was especially robust and sentiment survey showed that consumer confidence remains strong. Home sales continue to rise with the second quarter on pace set the strongest quarterly sales volume since 2007. Price appreciation remained steady at the 5% to 6% rate nationally and appreciation isn\u2019t just restricted to coastal states, every state and 90% of all metro areas have experienced an increase during the past year. And job gains remains solid with 69 consecutive monthly increases, the longest on record including the strong June report released just last week.", "Before I conclude, I want to highlight the announce that we made earlier this week, Carrie Tolstedt, Head of Community Banking who has been with Wells Fargo for 27 years have decided to retire at year end. She and her team have built an extraordinary franchise one that meets the needs of millions of customers nationwide and has served investors very well for decades. Mary Mack who currently serves as President and Head of Wells Fargo Advisors will succeed Carrie effective July 31. Mary is a 32-year veteran of the financial services industry and has a diverse mix of experiences including retail banking, which will serve her well as she takes the reign of this key business. This transition highlights our commitment to stable long-range succession planning and our belief that our team members are our most valuable resource.", "I will now turn the call over to John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide more details on our quarterly results. John?", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on page 2, then John and I will answer your questions. Our results in the second quarter were straightforward and demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers. Compared with the first quarter, we had strong loan and deposit growth, we increased net interest income by growing earning assets. Many of our customer facing businesses generated strong fee growth. Our efficiency ratio improved. Credit quality remained solid and our capital position remained strong while we returned more capital to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchase. Our net payout ratio was 62% in the second quarter. On page 3, you can see the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted including increases in revenue, pre-tax, pre-provision profit, loans and deposits. While our earnings were down $161 million from a year ago, our results in the second quarter last year included a $350 million reserve release while this quarter we had a $150 million reserve build primarily due to loan growth in commercial, auto and the credit card portfolios.", "Turning to page 4, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. With the expectation of rates remaining lower-for-longer, we grew our investment securities portfolio by $18.5 billion, with $38 billion of gross purchases in the second quarter significantly higher than the $5 billion repurchases last quarter and higher than the $26 billion of average quarterly purchases last year. We completed these purchases before the rate declined late in the quarter driven by the Brexit vote. We also added to duration as we've done in the past with interest rate swaps, the converted portion of our variable rate commercial loans to fixed rate, a $13 billion increase in swap notional from first quarter. Even with these actions we remain asset sensitive. Long-term debt increased $16 billion, with $24 billion of issuances including 10.7 - including $10.7 billion issued by the holding company, which we expect to be grandfathered as TLAC eligible. As we highlighted at Investor Day we expect that we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $50 billion in order to be compliant including a 100 basis point buffer which we plan to complete through measured issuance over the phase-in period of approximately five years. However this year we have a high level of debt maturing, so some of our eligible TLAC issuance will be used to offset these maturities.", "Turning to the income statement overview on page 5, revenue declined $33 million from the first quarter as growth in net interest income was offset by lower non-interest income. I will highlight the drivers of these trends throughout the call but let me discuss how the businesses we've sold and acquired impacted our results this quarter. As I mentioned at Investor Day for several years now we've been focused on reducing non-core businesses simplifying our organization and improving our risk profile. In the first quarter, we sold our crop insurance business and our results included a $381 million gain from that sale. While the impact to our ongoing earnings from selling this business is negligible, the sale did reduce insurance revenue and related insurance expense this quarter. In the second quarter, we sold our health benefit services business for $290 billion gain. The go forward effect from the sale of this business is not material to our financial results. Our results this quarter also reflected the acquisition of the GE Capital businesses that be completed in the first quarter, including the full quarter impact of the $26.7 billion of commercial and industrial loans and leases that closed on March 1. As we stated at Investor Day the quarterly benefit to net interest income from the GE Capital acquisition was approximately $300 million. Lease income also increased this quarter from the operating leases acquired along with corresponding higher operating lease expense. The acquisition of the Asia segment to GE Capital's commercial distribution finance business was completed on July 1 and the remaining international assets of approximately $2 billion are expected to close later this year. We are pleased with the overall integration of the GE Capital businesses and we still expect the GE Capital acquisition to be modestly accretive to our results this year.", "As shown on page 6, we had continued strong loan growth in the second quarter, up 8% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. Period end commercial loan balances grew $6.3 billion from first quarter, remember the GE Capital acquisition only impacted average loan growth this quarter. Consumer loans increased $3.6 billion linked quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit card and securities-based lending was partially offset by declines in junior lean mortgages and seasonally lower student lending. Our total average loan yield was stable at 4.16% as the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition was offset by lower consumer yields. On page 7, we highlight our broad-based year-over-year loan growth. C&I loans were up $39 billion or 14% driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Commercial real estate loans grew $10.7 billion or 8% primarily in our real estate mortgage portfolio. Real estate one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $9.3 billion or 3% with strong growth and high quality non-conforming mortgage loans. As a reminder, we sell our conforming mortgage loan originations to the agencies. This portfolio also reflected the continued run-off of the pick-a-pay portfolio. Auto loans were up $4.1 billion or 7% with origination volumes up 2% while we maintained our underwriting and pricing discipline. Credit card balances were up $3 billion or 10% reflecting new account openings and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.1 billion or 6% with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans.", "As highlighted on page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the second quarter, up $51.4 billion or 4% from a year ago. Consumer and small-business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago and primary consumer checking customers grew 4.7% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 11 basis points, up 1 basis point from first quarter and 3 basis points from a year ago reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain wholesale banking customers. Page 9 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and non-interest income while the drivers of non-interest income have varied, fee income was also 47% of revenue a year ago and last quarter. Market sensitive revenue which includes trading and gains on debt and equity securities can vary based on market conditions during the quarter. Our market sensitive results in the second quarter which included strong gains from trading and debt security gains was partially offset by lower equity gains. The sum was only $85 million higher than the five- quarter average. We grew net interest income $66 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by long growth including the full quarter benefit of the assets acquired from GE Capital. The benefit from loan growth was partially offset by reduced income at our investment securities portfolio reflecting accelerated prepayments primarily on our mortgage-backed securities. We also had higher interest expense from the long-term debt issuances that I highlighted earlier on the call and lower interest income from trading assets.", "The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the first quarter primarily due to growth in long-term debt and deposits and reduced income from investment securities. All other balance sheet growth, mix changes and repricing was beneficial to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the second quarter by 4% from a year ago even with 11 basis point reduction in NIM. And we continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full-year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 in the current rate environment. While total non-interest income decreased $99 million from the first quarter, we had growth in many areas that reflect our focus on key business drivers including increases in service charges on deposit accounts, brokerage fees, trust and investment management, investment banking, card fees, gains on mortgage loan originations, trading gains on higher customer accommodation activity, and lease income reflecting the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition.", "Total mortgage banking revenue which includes both the gain on the sale from originations and servicing income declined $184 million from the first quarter. Production revenue increased $306 million or 41% reflecting higher originations. Origination volume was $63 billion, up 43% from the first quarter due to the seasonally stronger purchase market and increased refinancing due to lower rates. Applications were up 23% from first quarter and we ended the quarter with $47 billion application pipeline, up 21% from first quarter and up 24% from a year ago. Since Brexit and the related decrease in mortgage rates, we\u2019ve seen refinance activity increase with our retail application volumes up approximately 15% to 20% in recent weeks and we currently expect origination volume to be somewhat higher in the third quarter compared with the second quarter. Our production margin on residential held for sale mortgage originations was 166 basis points in the second quarter, down 2 basis points from the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability increased $69 million from the first quarter, which also contributed to higher production revenue. Servicing income declined $490 million from the first quarter primarily driven by changes in MSR valuation adjustments which were positive last quarter and slightly negative in the second quarter. There MSR valuation adjustments are outside the scope of our hedging and vary over time as MSR valuation assumptions are updated.", "Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our hedge results in the second quarter given the increased rate volatility late in the quarter. Servicing income also declined from higher quarterly unreimbursed servicing costs, primarily related to FHA loans. Other income declined $392 million from first quarter, the reduction was driven by a decline in hedge and effectiveness income from $379 million in the first quarter to $56 million in the second quarter. The decline also reflected the gain from the sale of the crop insurance business recognized last quarter and the gain on the sale of our health benefits services business in the second quarter with a net impact from these sales of $91 million lower other income compared with the first quarter. As shown on page 12, expenses declined $162 million from the first quarter, driven by lower personal expenses which are typically higher in the first quarter due to higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement eligible team members. Expenses also declined from lower operating losses, down $120 million from the first quarter on lower litigation expense. Insurance expenses declined $89 million reflecting the sale of the crop insurance business in the first quarter. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase of $186 million from outside professional services after typically lower expenses in the first quarter.", "Operating lease depreciation expense was up $117 million from the first quarter reflecting the full quarter impact of the leases acquired from GE Capital. As a reminder, beginning in the third quarter, we estimate that our total FDIC assessment will increase by approximately $100 million per quarter reflecting the temporary FDIC surcharge which became effective July 1. Our efficiency ratio was 58.1% in the second quarter and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our targeted efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full-year 2016. While we\u2019re already operating at one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth. While total expenses have increased, we\u2019ve reduced expenses in many categories even as we've grown the balance sheet by acquiring businesses and adding new customers. The increase in expenses is primarily been related to risk, compliance and technology spending reflected in higher personal expense, outside professional services and contract services. We\u2019ve also continued to invest in innovation to better serve our customers.", "Let me give you just a few examples. During the second quarter, we launched the FastFlex Small Business Loan, an online fast decision loan that funded as soon as the next business day. This was an innovation we built in-house. In addition, we launched yourFirstMortgage, a new home loan program to help more qualified first-time homebuyers and low to moderate income consumers become homeowners. Early reaction to this program has been positive with over $1 billion of applications in the first 30 days. And wholesale banking, we introduced biometric authentication by piloting eyeprint image capture technology in our commercial electronic office mobile channel. This line highlights just a few examples that we\u2019ve recently announced, we\u2019re working on additional products and services within our innovation group that are scheduled to be released over the coming quarters that we believe will add tangible long-term value for our customers and shareholders.", "Turning to our business segment starting on page 14; community banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter, down 1% from a year ago and 4% from the first quarter. We remain focused on providing outstanding customer service and achieved record store customer loyalty scores during the second quarter and the highest year-to-date retail banking household retention in four years. We continually work to enhance customer satisfaction and transparency and ensure customers are receiving the right products to meet their financial needs. Because the key to our success is long lasting customer relationships built on trust. For example, an hour after opening a new deposit account, our customers are sent a customized welcome email including a summary of accounts in ways to get the full value from their accounts. We are also focused on using innovation to enhance our customer experience. Mobile banking is our most frequently used channel and we have 18 million mobile active users. Beginning August 1, our mobile customers will be able to make real-time person-to-person payment. P2P payments are not new to Wells Fargo with our customers conducted over $10 billion in P2P volume through our SurePay service in 2015. We were the number one debit card issuer by transaction volume which increased 9% from a year ago while dollar volume was $76.4 billion, up 8% from a year ago.", "Credit card purchase volume was $19.4 billion, up 10% from a year ago benefiting from 8% active account growth. Credit card penetration to retail banking households increased to 45.6%, up from 44.6% a year ago. Wholesale banking earned $2.1 billion in the second quarter, down 5% from a year ago and up 8% from the first quarter. The decline from a year ago was driven by higher provision expense related to the oil and gas portfolio. However charge offs for wholesale banking are still historically low with only 27 basis points of net charge offs annualized in the second quarter. Revenue grew 10% from a year ago and 5% linked quarter as net interest income and non-interest income both increased on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. Loan growth remained strong driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $65.2 billion or 17% from a year ago, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Spreads on new originations were slightly better than the existing portfolio. Average deposit balances declined $6.6 billion from a year ago, driven by lower international deposits from market volatility and our pricing discipline in the competitive rate environment.", "Wealth and investment management earned $584 million in the second quarter, stable from a year ago and up 14% from the first quarter. Our diversified revenue streams provided stability during a period of market volatility. Second-quarter revenue of $3.9 billion was up 2% linked quarter and down 1% year-over-year. Our Continued emphasis on meeting our client's financial needs through planned based relationships resulted in record high WIM client assets of $1.7 trillion, up 2% from a year ago with gross resulting from both existing client relationships as well as new client acquisitions. Net interest income was up 12% year-over-year driven by continued strong balance sheet growth. Average deposits were up 9% from a year ago and loans were up 12%, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Loan growth was broad-based with strong client demand across a number of product offerings. We are very excited to welcome Kristi Mitchem who became the Head of Wells Fargo Asset Management on June 1. She has strong industry experience and will lead this business into the next phase of strategic expansion and growth. Turning to page 17, credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio with only 39 basis points of annualized net charge offs. Net charge offs increased $38 million from the first quarter including an increase of $59 million from our oil and gas portfolio which was partially offset by $46 million of lower consumer real estate losses.", "Non-performing assets decreased $433 million from the first quarter as lower residential and commercial real estate non-accruals and foreclosed assets were partially offset by higher oil and gas non-accruals. As I mentioned earlier, we had $150 million reserve build during the quarter primarily related to long growth in the commercial, auto and credit card portfolios. Slide 18 highlights our oil and gas portfolio, while oil prices have risen from where they were a year ago there continues to be pressure in the oil and gas sector. We had $263 million of net charge offs in this portfolio in the second quarter, up $59 million from the first quarter with approximately 94% of losses from the E&P and services sector. Non-accrual loans were $2.6 billion, up $651 million from the first quarter on weaker financial performance, the run-off of borrower hedges and less sponsor support. Approximately 90% of non-accruals were current on interest in principle, most of the losses we\u2019ve taken were from non-accruals that were current but we recorded losses based on our judgment of not being repaid in full.", "Our oil and gas loans outstanding declined 4% from the first quarter and were down 2% from a year ago. Oil and gas loans of $17.1 billion are less than 2% of total loans outstanding. Our oil and gas loan exposure which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding was also down 4% from first quarter and down 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by borrowing base reductions. We had no defensive draws in the second quarter. And as in every challenging cycle, we are also seeing opportunities and we originated new loans during the second quarter to well-qualified borrowers. Criticized loans which include non-accrual loans were down $1.7 billion or 17% from first quarter reflecting paydowns, borrowing base upgrades and net charge offs. And for the first time in the past six quarters we did not have a reserve build for oil and gas portfolio and reserve coverage was stable at 9.2% of total oil and gas loans outstanding. Our reserves declined from $1.7 billion to $1.6 billion reflecting the increase in energy prices with slower pace of deterioration in credit quality improved criticized asset levels and the smaller loan portfolio.", "Overall the performance of our oil and gas portfolio in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations and our experience of managing through many cycles will continue to benefit us and our customers as we move through the remainder of the cycle. Turning to page 19, our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity tier-1 ratio fully phased in at 10.6% in the second quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers, and our internal buffer. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 27.4 million shares through share repurchases of 44.8 million. We also increased our common stock dividend in the second quarter to $0.38 per share. Our net payout ratio was 62% within our targeted range of 55% to 75%. In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model, we had solid returns with a 1.2% ROA, 11.7% ROE and our return on tangible common equity was 14.15%. We\u2019ve continued to benefit from executing on our vision with success in growing customers, loans and deposits. The headwinds from a flatter yield curve and a lower-for-longer rate environment creates challenges for all financial institutions but we will continue to focus on what we can control earning lifelong relationships with our customers which drive our long-term growth opportunities.", "John and I will now answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Erika Najarian", "Just taking a step back John, I think you said in your prepared remarks that investors own this company given your ability to grow earnings regardless of what's happening in the market, is this flatter yield curve persists and we don't have - we don't see rehikes from the Fed, I'm wondering what you think are your strongest levers for supporting EPS growth from here? Is it continued balance sheet growth, is it even more disciplined expense management, is it growth and fees in businesses where you don't have scale yet, just trying to figure out, Wells always have as a reputation for pulling on levers to support EPS growth and I'm wondering as we look out over the next 12 months what you think are the most impactful ones are?", "John Shrewsberry", "I think it's all of the above Erika, you mentioned in broad terms the likeliest sources, if rates are going to remain lower, we will work hard at earning asset growth. And the first call on our capital and liquidity is to serve customers, so we'll be looking for loan growth and we've had great success in organic loan growth in commercial categories as well as in consumer categories. So that would be job one. I think we\u2019re seeing nice momentum across a variety of the fee streams that we have, I mentioned some of them in my remarks but there are many and we\u2019ve - some of them were - our businesses where we already have complete scale and some of them are businesses that that we\u2019re - where we\u2019re under indexed and continuing to grow. So maybe the long-term opportunity is even bigger. I think we're working hard at expense discipline in this environment to accomplish all that we are trying to accomplish in compliance and risk management but innovate at the same time and stay within our range which we've managed to do. And as I also called out, we\u2019re sort of - we\u2019re comping over periods where we had been releasing excess allowance and now because our loan portfolio is growing, we\u2019re building some allowance, so we\u2019re muscling through that headwind but we\u2019re accomplishing our goals.", "John Stumpf", "Let me just drill down a little bit on the expense side Erika, we operate within our 55% to 59% range on the efficiency ratio, which is, you know that's either at close to or at the top of our industry surely for our large bank peers, we\u2019ve spend a lot of money in the last couple of years around things like compliance and risk management and so forth. And as you build those, you spend more money, once you get into a rhythm there is an opportunity to get more eloquent, start to take some of those front end costs out and built it in as part of your process. John also mentioned that we continue to look to simplify our business to get more standard and frankly a lot of the investments we\u2019re making on customer service and consumer convenience has a front-end cost component but a back end benefit. So those things are all on the table, we can even look at those and in a lower-for-longer environment pennies and nickels and dimes matter.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. And as we think about balance sheet mix management near term, I'm wondering if, you know, I guess what it would take to may be extend even more aggressively extend duration and protect the margin near term or you're not going to manage your asset and liabilities based on sort of the market is thinking about the curve near term.", "John Stumpf", "So it's a good question, and the things that we're balancing are - and readjusting constantly are expectation for what rates are going to do next and whether today is a better or worse entry point then waiting a quarter or waiting longer. We\u2019re balancing the capital sensitivity and what happens when you meaningfully add duration at what might be a cyclically low point in rates, we\u2019re saying we think it's going to be lower for longer but we have to sensitize ourselves to what happens if we get much more invested here and rates move up and that destroys capital. So that's a limiter in some sense. And then we've got our liquidity constraints of how we might deploy what we might use and what it means in terms of available liquidity. So it's a delicate balance going on all the time, but I would say that we\u2019re relatively convinced that we may not be this low forever but like we said a year ago our expectation is lower-for-longer at the curve and we're going to keep putting money to work.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Mike Mayo", "This is going to be a very short-term specific question but it will save us work later today. So, you had a $290 million gain on the sale of the health benefits services that added I guess about $0.04, so if we strip out that $0.04 from your dollar one it would mean you fell short of consensus. Are there any other items and expenses are anywhere else that might have mitigated that gain, in other words, when you look at the results, do you think they met consensus and if so, what offset that $0.04 gain?", "John Stumpf", "I don't create a detailed reconciliation back to the consensus versus our numbers. We\u2019re looking at the total output every quarter we got a laundry list of things that might be seasonal that might be episodic, it could be gains from securities portfolio, we\u2019ve been selling a handful of non-core businesses and some of them have given rise to gains. So there isn\u2019t that type of reconciliation, I would look at those categories of revenue that come through and look at the multi-quarter, the five quarter average and think about how far above or below we are at any quarter versus that longer term average and model it or manage it that way.", "Mike Mayo", "Could you give us some of your laundry list?", "John Stumpf", "Some of our laundry list?", "Mike Mayo", "Yes, like what we just\u2026", "John Stumpf", "But my laundry list is what you guys see back which are market sensitive items that you often call out as unreliably different from quarter to quarter, some of the mortgage activity which can be a little bit more episodic, mortgage hedging activity, this is what some analysts refer to as things that they have a hard time modeling, I mentioned gains on the sale of debt or equity securities. There are seasonal impacts on things like investment banking fees that happened at certain times, all of those things ebb and flow. And I would look at the longer term either calendar adjusted or multi-quarter averages and think about it that way.", "Mike Mayo", "All right, and then just one more follow-up then just, when you look at mortgage revenues this quarter, where they where you thought they\u2019d be and what you expect going ahead, you said the mortgage pipeline is up quite a bit?", "John Stumpf", "I\u2019d say on the origination side where we expected them to be and as you heard, the pipeline is full, I think margins are in a good place and we anticipate having a good third quarter on the origination side. Our mortgage hedging results in the second quarter and the net economic impact of mortgage servicing was lower than for example the five quarter average, it was higher in the quarter before, so the difference is even more stark. But I think where - we think it is a great time to be the leader in the mortgage business right now because homes are selling and also because people are refinancing. So we are expecting good things.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Bill Carcache", "We've seen loan growth outpacing deposit growth for several quarters at both Wells Fargo and the industry in general. In the post LCR world where HQLA levels are a factor, how high do you think we can expect loan to deposit ratios to rise and with loan growth continuing at a healthy clip, can you envision a scenario where competition for deposits begins to heat up among banks and basically it causes them to start raising rates possibly even before the Fed as competition for deposit intensifies, can you speak to that?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, I suppose it could, I think we're probably in the - at the higher end of the range of loan to deposit ratios ourselves in the high 70s I guess at this point. And of course there are a lot of other sources of liquidity that are coming in as a result - at least for G-SIBs as a result of TLAC et cetera and some reliable sources if non-deposit wholesale funding that are part of a healthy liability management mix. So, funding never really seems to be a problem. We've imagined frankly since LCR was first proposed that people would be competing for deposits, especially smaller firms who have less of a value proposition for customers and they really have to pay for deposits in order to attract them. And it really hasn\u2019t seem to come to pass. I don't know whether aggregate credit creation is outstripping aggregate deposit generation by so much that it's going to cause firms at the margin to raise prices, compete for deposits and drive up the cost for the rest of us, it could happen, we haven't seen it. What we\u2019re seeing among assets is a lot more things changing hands, so a big part of our loan growth are loans coming out of GE and coming onto our books and loans coming off of other people's books and onto our books and as opposed to the aggregates being impacted in the way that you describe.", "John Stumpf", "Bill, [indiscernible] I don't know this, but my guess is aggregate credit generation in the private sector, forget public debt for a second here, but I doubt that that\u2019s growing faster than deposits. I look at the last seven, eight years here since our merger our Wachovia, the time of the merger we had something less than $800 billion of deposits, now we are over $1.2 trillion, we've grown deposits even after run-off of those high-priced CDs by $400 billion or $500 billion, we\u2019re up maybe $100 billion on loans during that period of time, so deposits are far outstripped loans in fact, if you believe lower-for-longer there is going to be a hunger for earning assets. And while our quarter two might look different recently, if we look at, in our last year, the growth of $51 billion of deposits versus $80 billion of loans if you strip out some of the loans that we purchased, if you look on organic basis we\u2019re still growing deposits faster. So it's - I would - I doubt, I don't see pressure from that perspective.", "Bill Carcache", "That's great colour, thank you. If I could ask a follow-up on the consumer credit side of your business. How do you think about the appropriate level of reserve coverage in auto and card, and do you think the current environment is supportive of a path where charge offs and reserves in those businesses can grow on-line with loans such that the consumer credit provision is not a headwind to your earnings growth.", "John Shrewsberry", "It's a good question, and it will be different for every bank depending on what type of consumer credit they have on their books. As we mentioned, we added a little bit to our allowance this quarter and in part it was from consumer credit but that's based on the growth in the portfolio not because of any meaningful change in underlying behavior. My sense is that if those loans are priced properly for their risk and given the way that we provide for them as those portfolios grow that it shouldn't become too much of a headwind. Now we've said earlier that we are happy to provide more reserve more allowance when we\u2019re growing our loan portfolio that\u2019s because it was going to happen as we came out of the period of releases and are moving into a period of net provisioning and growth. But it's going to feel different for everybody based on the quality of the loans that they put on their books based on the pricing related to the quality of the loans they put on their books, so it's hard to generalize. I think we - I think we feel pretty good about it.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "John McDonald", "John just a follow up on the credit, the charge off rate was pretty stable quarter to quarter, just wondering underneath that are there any areas of credit portfolios were losses are still improving and some that are starting to normalize and do you have kind of short-term outlook on credit staying stable to benign?", "John Shrewsberry", "If you set aside oil and gas for a moment from our aggregate results, I think our net charge offs were something like 28 basis points on the portfolio overall just for analytical purposes that's an interesting number that would suggest that they\u2019ve continued to improve, obviously 39 basis points when considering oil and gas. I think it's a reasonable expectation that consumer credit performance normalizes somewhat so that we\u2019ve had the best of times, it probably gets a little bit more average while things being equal. As Bill asked, I don't know if that makes it a real headwind, I think that means the expected case is probably a little bit lower ROI than the existing case for most people who have been benefiting from the best of times in credit but not so meaningfully that it causes us to want to curtail growth based on the way we approach the market, as I mentioned we are happy with our auto growth, we\u2019ve maintained our pricing and our risk discipline.", "John Stumpf", "And John, the 28 basis points John just mentioned to you, there is a lot of Johns here, but for this quarter ex-oil and gas is equal to what it was a year ago. So there is some movement within those categories but as you know housing is getting better everywhere and that hugely benefits us. So while there might be some more normalization in one part of the consumer, it might be offset by another part of the consumer.", "John Shrewsberry", "Couple of callouts are on the consumer real estate side of things. In second mortgages, I think we're down below 50 basis points of charge-offs, which for home equity loans is, it can't get much better than that. And on one to four family first mortgage loans, I think we're in the 2 basis point charge-off range right now, which is something let\u2019s celebrate when it's happening, but it doesn't feel like a permanent state of affairs.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And then a quick follow-up on net interest income. Assuming the rate environment doesn't change much, can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes for growing net interest income, maybe size up the degree of difficulty of growing that going forward? And then just on the liquidity cash on the balance sheet, when we look at that Fed funds sold like roughly 300 billion, is there any way for us to kind of get a sense of how much of that might be redeployable versus how much is needed to meet the requirements of LCR and other kind of regulatory needs to hold liquidity?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. So there is not much limitation on the redeployment of that into HQLA, while still satisfying the liquidity coverage ratio. So it really gets back to the, when is the right time and how much at that time, if you\u2019re, just for example, buying treasuries because of the capital implications that it creates by putting more AFS securities on the books. You're that much more exposed to a backup. So there is a trade-off there. For non-HQLA, the limitations are different because you are losing the benefit of that liquidity and we've continued to mention the ability to move out of cash or HQLA into risk assets, all things being equal, based on a snapshot as tens of billions of dollars of activity. ", "You saw what we did last year when we, or earlier this year as we were sizing up taking GE assets on to our books. We actually went out and did a little bit of incremental funding in the marketplace to have that liquidity set aside and that we\u2019re allowing that to run off, it was relatively short-term, but it makes sense for us to have ready access to something, some, call it, $200 billion worth of instant liquidity at any point in time. That said, given our size, given our risk profile and given our stress cases. Is that helpful?", "John McDonald", "Yeah. Thanks, John. And just the broader comment about just kind of degree of difficulty growing NII overall in this environment? Yeah. Thanks", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. Well, it is harder to grow net interest income in a lower rate environment than otherwise, which is obvious. The short end of the curve is one thing, but this move down in seven years and out, is just as hard and just as meaningful because of the redeployment. So it\u2019s still our plan and our goal and what we\u2019re telling you is that we intend to grow net interest income, even if there are no rate moves and we're doing it by adding -- by redeploying cash into HQLA and other earning assets, by looking everywhere for customers where we can make quality loans and those are the big items. So it's our plan, it's our effort, it's what we\u2019re all working toward, but it\u2019s harder.", "John Stumpf", "And John, the biggest influence that Brexit had on our company was not on, frankly, a direct impact on the way we do business or customer strengthen like that, it really was the big move down in long-term rates.", "John Shrewsberry", "One other thing to say is, it's a great time to be a borrower, it's a great time to be one of our customers. The mortgage business is one obvious place to look for the origination fee generation or gain generation, but across the board, I would expect more, everything is more affordable on a finance basis. So it helps.", "John McDonald", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Barker", "Thank you. In regards to your servicing results within the mortgage bank, were there any changes in the way you\u2019ve hedged that asset this quarter or was there something just specific around the rate curve and the movement in the yield curve in the second quarter versus the first quarter that would have caused the hedging gains to be less than expected?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. It's a good question. There wasn't really any change to the hedging approach and our hedging results, strictly speaking, accomplished what they were intended to. There were a handful of items that went, call it, in our favor in the first quarter that were negatives in the second quarter and some of them are just model inputs in terms of how the MSR valuation calculation works. Some of it obviously was just lower servicing fees, that's not a hedging outcome, but it contributed to the net servicing, net servicing benefits, things have speeded up. Of course, we\u2019re getting more servicing calls away from us, even as we originated this pace, there is more servicing getting called away from us as others originate rapidly as well. So I would expect that to normalize and I would think about that also as something more along the lines of a multi-quarter average. One other item I\u2019d point out is that the unreimbursed servicing costs was a net drag, an incremental net drag this quarter as well. And that's mostly around FHA activity.", "Kevin Barker", "In regards to the FHA activity, what is the headwind that you\u2019re seeing from unreimbursed insurance claims this quarter or how would you look at it, like the run rate from that line item?", "John Stumpf", "Well, I think we're talking about a couple of hundred million dollars of unreimbursed direct costs in the second quarter and the run rate is probably half of that, looking back over the last several quarters.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay. And then in regards to the introduction of your first mortgage, have you seen an incremental increase in your overall mortgage originations from the introduction of that product or would you expect that to accelerate on a go forward basis?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, so, there is an increase, all things being equal, on the agency side of things, but many of those borrowers might have been FHA eligible borrowers prior to the introduction of that program. So in some sense, we\u2019re shifting origination from one program to another. It\u2019s -- we think it\u2019s a very high-quality program. It\u2019s -- the way we've described it and constructed it, it's never worse for a customer, it's often better for a customer because it's got a different approach to MI. That's more borrower friendly. So there should be more availability for it and it should help grow originations over time. And as we mentioned, it's particularly valuable to us because it gives access to mortgage credit to low and middle income borrowers and first-time home buyers, who are people that we\u2019re really trying to serve.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.", "Paul Miller", "Yes. On the follow-up to Kevin's questions on your first mortgage, is this very similar to what FHA product, but outside of the FHA, [indiscernible] low FICO, low down payment type loans?", "John Stumpf", "Well, it\u2019s lower down payment. Actually, the first part of your question is, this is an agency program, this is a Wells Fargo and Fannie program. It is geared to serve the first-time homebuyer and the low and middle income homebuyer. So there is some overlap with people that the FHA might be serving as I mentioned, and it is built around a lower initial down payment to make it easier for those people to access credit. I wouldn't describe it as a predominantly as a lower FICO or lower credit quality, but more of structured for people who have lower down payment available.", "John Shrewsberry", "And Paul, it really looks at those first-time homebuyers especially, so it really looks to serve that market. Many times have a lower down payment available.", "Paul Miller", "And this product will be sold or ran by Fannie Mae guaranteed?", "John Stumpf", "It's agency modest production, so it doesn't look any different in our books, it goes right into agency security. So there is no different risk profile on our books, and frankly one of the reasons that the program makes so much sense for us is because we have such a commercial relationship with Fannie in terms of knowing what our risks are, what their risks are and when those risks pass and that's very helpful.", "Paul Miller", "Okay. And I don't know if you disclosed this or not, but do you guys know what you are recapture rate is on your refis right now on your book? You have one of the biggest books out there and there are MSR, are you able to recapture a lot of those refis?", "John Shrewsberry", "So we do capture a lot of our refis, we don't think we've disclosed the capture rate. We probably do disclose our market share, both in origination and in servicing. I don't have them at my fingertips, but we\u2019ll come back to you with the most recent specifics and that relationship will help you to, I mean, there is obviously other things going on there, because a lot of mortgage origination is not refi activity. But, it might be helpful.", "Paul Miller", "Hey, guys. Thank you very much.", "John Stumpf", "Paul, just one quick thing, we are recapturing less today as John mentioned because some products, we\u2019re no longer in, so some of that refinances is refinancing away from us where we would have captured more in the past, some of the high-risk categories.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Matt O'Connor", "Good morning. To follow up on expenses, a lot of talk earlier about the investment spend, the risk, the compliance, obviously growth areas and then eventually getting the payback on that. As we think about just the pace of investment spend and that relationship of kind of getting it back on the other side, what inning are we in, in terms of still ramping on the investment and still waiting on the payoff?", "John Stumpf", "Well, I\u2019d say we\u2019re in the middle innings of the investment. We\u2019ve been doing it for a few years and we\u2019ll be doing it for a few more years I\u2019m sure, and we will always be innovating. But in some cases, we\u2019re getting the payback. You saw at Investor Day, the moves that we made toward more of a paperless store and we talked about the specifics in terms of what the benefit is of taking paper, labor, storage, transportation out of stores. That\u2019s happened, that\u2019s in our run rate. A lot of the digital and mobile migration that we have of customer activity is taking personal interactions out of those types of transactions, it's taking paper out for sure. And those benefits feed right into the run rate as they happen. ", "John was mentioning the initial investment and build to create some of these new programs and compliance and risk management for example and the fact that once they are highly effective and repeatable, then there is an opportunity to automate, to streamline, to learn from how we got there and to make them more efficient. I\u2019d say those opportunities are, we\u2019re always learning, but they\u2019re probably a little bit more in the future. And then, who knows where we\u2019ll be going with the increase in mobility, et cetera, my sense is, we\u2019re just going to keep benefiting. Customers benefit on the one hand, but from an expense perspective, we will keep benefiting as well. I\u2019d point out the P2P activity as another place where we're taking checks out, taking cash handling out, increasing customer service, but doing it at a lower cost to serve. So there is a lot of that.", "Matt O'Connor", "Are you still at a point where you\u2019re increasing overall investment spend or are you able to remix some of it so that it\u2019s still at a high level, but not necessarily going up?", "John Stumpf", "I think it\u2019s still going up a little bit. We've been doing that while taking expense out of our standard run rate in order to accommodate it, while staying within our 55 to 59. So, and as the nature of mobile first and technological solutions first occurs, we\u2019re always going to be spending at a high level. We\u2019ll just keep at least for innovative types of activity. I think we will keep doing what we're doing, taking expense out of our business as usual.", "Matt O'Connor", "And then just separately, you mentioned in the press release about the higher amortization on the mortgage bond book, which makes sense, given the sharp drop in the rate, but do you have the figures in terms of how much it was this quarter versus last and remind us how your strategy or approach there is, is there like a mark to marking or is there a smoothing effect, one of your peers has, what feels like a mark-to-market impact, they take their head upfront, some of the peers do that a little bit more, remind us how your approach is?", "John Stumpf", "Yes. What I would point out is that we\u2019re amortizing premiums on mortgage securities in particular that are highly prepayment sensitive and in this quarter, the net interest margin or net interest dollars negative impact of getting premium book value bonds called away at par was, I think the number is $100 million. I\u2019m confirming, it\u2019s $100 million. So that's one way of thinking about it. So we put a mortgage security on at a premium, we amortize that premium over an expected life and an expected CPR, things come in faster and we have to write off the remaining premium when it happens. This quarter, that impact was $100 million.", "Matt O'Connor", "Do you have that for last quarter?", "John Stumpf", "I don't think I do handy, but it wasn\u2019t $100 million, so less.", "Matt O'Connor", "Got it. Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead.", "Brian Foran", "Hi, how are you. Maybe just two quick ones on credit. First in auto lending, you mentioned the Mannheim is up a little bit, but severities are up a little bit as well. What\u2019s driving that, I know it\u2019s not a huge number, but what\u2019s driving that disconnect?", "John Stumpf", "Mannheim is up a little bit. It was up in each of the last few months and I think as we\u2019ve said, there is an expectation that that can't go on forever, and that's part of why we would say that we expect future losses to be a little bit more normal in that business than what's been happening. Any change in severity is really just the change in the mix, the repo activity, the circumstances of what's been coming in. I don\u2019t think there is a systematic reason for it.", "John Shrewsberry", "Brian, I would just add that it's been a really strong new car sales the last couple of years. Some of those go out and lease programs and they come off leased. So our guess is that there will be more late-model used cars on the market, put pressure on Mannheim, but on the other hand, which could cost them normalization in losses. On the other hand, that's really where we play and where we have a lot of market expertise. So it\u2019s a bit of an offset.", "Brian Foran", "Thank you. And then on commercial real estate, I mean, I guess let\u2019s think about both your commentary and data as well as like what the OCC is saying, et cetera, there is just kind of general concern around underwriting standards, but at the same time, the current data around loan growth is pretty good and on charge-offs, kind of bouncing between zero and net recovery. So it's about as good as it can get. How are you thinking about the commercial real estate cycle now? Is it just kind of pockets of concern or is there a concern that there is maybe a more broad-based turn on the horizon or how do you kind of think about the concerns around underwriting standards versus the very good numbers today?", "John Stumpf", "Yes. So I would say that our underwriting approach to commercial real estate tends to be at the conservative end of the spectrum and we have a reputation often for better, sometimes customers to the [indiscernible] which helps us well through cycles as you are alluding to, this is a very cyclical business. It is regional and local, it is property type by property type. There are some areas and some property types where values have been elevated because people have been willing to accept really, really low returns on their invested capital. And that's, that creates one sort of outcome and then there are others whether it\u2019s just a lot of supply that's coming on, has come on, has to be absorbed, that creates a different dynamic.", "We have seen that in some multi-family or luxury single-family from market to market and in that market, those dynamics have to play out where that gets absorbed at some clearing price. We\u2019re taking the same approach that we always have. We\u2019re sort of a relatively low loan to value lender. We look very hard at in place cash flow. We have a lot of incremental borrower guarantees and supplemental protections on our bigger commercial real estate types of financings and it's always been true. So I'm sure when the cycle turns, it will be either property types or geographies where they do better or worse, but we are not taking a big change, we're not seeing a big sea change, our originations have actually -- have been slower, certainly very slower before we bought the season's GE portfolio, the organic activity because of the competitive environment and because of the market circumstances caused us to slow down somewhat.", "Brian Foran", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks. Good morning. A question on the investment portfolio. John, you had mentioned that you had added a lot of securities this quarter before the rates changed and it looks like you did it mostly in the agency MBS and the held to maturity and I was just wondering given that it looks like that average yield was 190 or below, given that's where the averages are, how are you thinking about continuing to build the security's book versus potentially keeping more of your originated prediction where you can get free handle sale versus maybe 1.5 in the security\u2019s books, so what's your trade-off on interest rate risk versus credit risk I guess, and does your philosophy change, given where we are in the environment at all?", "John Stumpf", "Yes. It's a good question and it\u2019s analysis that we conduct. As I mentioned earlier, we've been continuing to sell all of our confirming production. There are limited, but some benefits, limited liquidity attribution, but some benefit to agency mortgage securities, but less so or not so with loans. So that\u2019s part of that determination. There is different risk profile for carrying loans on the books obviously versus guaranteed pass throughs, that's part of the analysis. We have a reasonably large allocation to single-family home loan real estate -- residential real estate today because of our jumbo portfolio, which we continue to want to make room for as we serve those customers going forward. So all those things sort of fit together in our risk appetite and have setting the ALCO considerations aside, but just from how much is enough and what type of risk do you need on your books, we\u2019ve followed the path that we\u2019ve followed, which isn't to say that if circumstances changed or persisted and the allocation opportunities look a little bit different, we wouldn't modify our conclusion, but that's where we've gotten thus far.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. And then just second question on commercial real estate brokerage, just within the other fees category, it's been a good business for you historically. It looks like it's gotten a little softer, is that purposeful change in how you\u2019re doing the business or is it just the environment, any color there will be great?", "John Stumpf", "It\u2019s cyclical, it's a great business for us. We\u2019re the best frankly in that business and there is a lot of knock-on benefit in terms of the financing that we do, investment banking that we do for those customers, but it is cyclical and it'll follow patterns like the ones that we just talked about in terms of what's going on in different markets. That business is interesting, because it's got something for bullish times in commercial real estate, and it's got something for bearish times in commercial real estate, because the same team is involved in helping define liquidity for properties and financing for properties when things aren\u2019t going well in markets and when investors are going the other way. So we like it, but it's a little bit harder to forecast, because it doesn't just trend up over time, it moves around, but it's been a great performer for the last couple of years.", "Ken Usdin", "So, there is no change in terms of how you are approaching it, it's just a little bit of an air pocket?", "John Stumpf", "It's just the normal volatility and what's happening in that business, no change.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joe Morford", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. The C&I growth seemed a bit softer this quarter, particularly relative to the pace you saw through much of last year. And is there anything to that, besides maybe some impact from energy and just how in general do you feel business owner confidence is these days, particularly given some of the uncertainties like Brexit and the upcoming election?", "John Shrewsberry", "I'm not sure what would inspire marginal business owner confidence in this environment. I mean, it's about the same as it has been recently, probably a little bit less certainty, given what's going on around the world. But I don't think of that as having a meaningful impact on the quarter\u2019s organic C&I loan growth. It\u2019s competitive and we\u2019re out there competing. There is some amount of capital formation around CapEx and expansion in other projects, not as much as there would be, if we were in a more vibrant overall economic environment. There is actually a little more happening in energy today than there was over the last several quarters, more capital being raised, more assets are changing here, just giving rise to some financing opportunities. So I would think of it more as a season or a short period of time to measure against.", "Joe Morford", "Okay. And then you also talked earlier about being disciplined on expenses and getting paper and transactions out of the stores, but more broadly speaking, how are you currently thinking about the overall retail distribution network, particularly given the growth in mobile banking, considering moving more aggressively or transitioning to the smaller neighborhood stores, or perhaps maybe don't need as much density in certain markets, it can reduce the overall footprint. What's the update there?", "John Stumpf", "Yes. Joe, I think that's an interesting question. We continue to look at that and we\u2019re not oblivious to the changes going on as you suggest. The mobile offerings are fastest-growing channel now, 18 million of our 20 some million households now have used that and sometimes -- most times as their dominant channel. So we continue to think about that. Our philosophy has been or will continue to be, we want to serve customers when, where and how they want to be served. We don't want to drive them some place to our benefit. We want to provide for their benefit. That being said, that's a big area of, we continue to look at as we innovate and we see customers change their behaviors.", "John Shrewsberry", "We\u2019re going to make it easier for them to do business with us in other channels as well. And if they change their behavior, then we will react to that. ", "John Stumpf", "We\u2019ll react to it and those could have some meaningful impacts on it.", "Joe Morford", "Right. Okay, thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "Good morning. I\u2019ll try to be quick, given the length of the call here, but I'm going to beat the dead horse here on the expense topic, but I know and I appreciate the color you gave on the leverage that you can pull given what we\u2019re seeing on the top line side here. Now, what I'm trying to just understand is, like, what do we need to see maybe it\u2019s in terms of where rates go or overall top line pressure, for you to start to really pull those levers more aggressively and again, maybe it's around expenses, and also longer term, is the goal just to keep the efficiency ratio, are you okay with that high-end of that range, even through \u201917, if this topline pressure persists from the curve, or do you at some point look to get to the middle of that range again? Thanks.", "John Shrewsberry", "Here is how we look at expenses. We look at this company, in fact, on Wednesday, we had our 164th birthday and we look at this company from a long-term perspective, we've always been thoughtful about how we spend our shareholders money. We\u2019re the stewards of your capital and their capital and surely a longer -- lower for longer scenario puts pressure on everything that we do, but we\u2019re going to continue to make those investments that we believe are good long-term investments to help customers succeed financially. ", "That being said, I do think we\u2019re at a point in time where there are some opportunities that because of changing customer behaviors, so we will, but we\u2019re not going to do something that's going to be short-term bright and long-term dull if you will, just because of pressure on the revenue side or the earnings side. Just assume that we\u2019re going to continue to work really hard on making investments and also maturing systems, taking out costs that don't add value. In other words, think of maximizing or monetizing our scale.", "John Pancari", "Got it. Thanks, John. And then if rates, if we only see another 25 basis points next year and that's it, is it fair to assume that you are in that upper range still of the efficiency ratio?", "John Shrewsberry", "I think we probably are. Yeah, which still is a world-class range and don't take for granted how hard one has to work to operate at 58% efficiency ratio. There is a lot that has to happen to stay there, while we\u2019re spending the money that we\u2019re spending to innovate and improve ourselves from a compliance risk management and other perspective.", "John Pancari", "Completely understood. All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Thanks. One narrow question and perhaps one broader one. On your servicing income and I'm looking at the data on page 40 of the release, your servicing fees are down year-over-year by order of magnitude, something like 20%, but your servicing portfolio is only down about 3%. What's the dynamic there on the servicing income?", "John Shrewsberry", "So there are older categories of loan products that are running off that might have different per pound fees associated with them, there is different categories of unreimbursed servicing expense that get netted against those servicing fees, and I mentioned, we are up $100 million I think in this quarter, which contributes to the delta between last year and this year, a quarter -- a year ago in this quarter. But the servicing book has been getting smaller, as we\u2019ve walked away from higher risk activities, et cetera and focused more on today\u2019s score agency mortgage origination. So that phenomena is something to grapple with when thinking about how that performs over the coming couple of years. As augmented by how successful we are, and on the origination side, and growing new servicing assets as well.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "But does the pace of change, I guess does the pace of change, change at all, because of the presumably many of the legacy assets are now being refied away and newer assets may look more like legacy assets in terms of servicing rate?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, I think what changes is the cost to service because we\u2019re working through the, we've had higher foreclosed and workout expenses over time. There is labor, there is extra compliance, there's a lot going on. The standards are still -- the new standards are as high as they've ever been, but the incidence will be going down over time. So my sense is that that should improve. There should be some scale there. And perhaps it's true also that the per pound revenue -- per loan revenue scales into today's run rate and with each new million dollars\u2019 worth of servicing that we add to the book, it doesn't pay the same servicing revenue as the legacy billion dollars. But you will watch that move slowly over time.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "And then if I can just step back for a moment, your earnings power for the past several years now has been running just above $4 and of course this current quarter, it\u2019s sort of affirm that run rate and the consensus for next year is closer to $4.30 and I'm not asking to specifically forecast, but could you help us understand like what bridges that increase in earnings power, presumably rates might be some of it, but is there and the balance sheet continues to grow, but in the absence of rates, would that figure be achievable or are we more in a trend line?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, there is a lot of unknowns in that question and we\u2019re not giving guidance on next year. But as was mentioned earlier by Erika in terms of what might happen or what has to happen, as we grow in the future, it will be earning asset growth, loans and investments, it will be how efficient we are on the expense side of things and then the whole spectrum of non-interest income generating possibilities. There is a lot of strength in the number of those line items. Yeah. The GE portfolio added, not just 40 odd billion dollars worth of loans, but over 200,000 commercial relationships, most of whom weren't meaningful relationships at Wells Fargo already. So it's doing more with customers and generating more lending opportunity, more non-interest income opportunity and executing along those lines. So lot of work.", "John Stumpf", "But if you think about the way we do business and our operating model, it's a great model to have for this economic environment, really when you think about it, we are the real economy. We do have 90 different businesses. We serve customers broadly and deeply and I don't think I\u2019d want any other model for this environment. Yeah.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks for taking the question. John, what I wanted to kind of drill down to is if you think about mortgage refinance, the way you\u2019ve got the accounting setup where you recognized at close and the way that servicing valuations get hit almost instantaneously when rates fall, you typically have a pressure quarter when refinance kicks in, followed by more favorable outcomes as you move forward. So I just [Technical Difficulty] And then the only thing I was going to add and follow up is if you think about what you were just responding to the one thing that I think you left out was the fact that share repurchase will reduce the shares outstanding by about half of that growth that was just highlighted. So capital announcements has a big part of what would generate any incremental growth, as if net income was absolutely flat from this point forward.", "John Stumpf", "We have been benefiting and we\u2019ll continue to benefit from taking share repurchase as a result of our capital plan. It is a driver for people who are measuring in earnings per share. Thanks for pointing that out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Bush", "Good morning, guys. At least, I think it\u2019s still mourning. Anyway, one larger question and two small ones. The commentary on the oil and gas portfolio and the trends there. It seems to be a little bit different than what we heard from JP Morgan Chase yesterday and US Bancorp earlier this morning where they seem to be a little less equivocal in the trends and it looks like you had a big addition to non-accruals, but you didn\u2019t add to the reserve for the portfolio. Yesterday, James Dimon talked about the companies and their portfolio having greater access to other financing. That seemed to be your trends or commentary was a little different than that. Can you just, I mean are there differences in your oil and gas portfolio or you're just being cautious here?", "John Stumpf", "I'd say both. There are probably differences. We have a big broad spectrum of upstream midstream and services companies that includes a lot of middle market companies, which our entire wholesale portfolio does. So the portfolios are probably different. We are generally cautious, however. I guess I\u2019d point out that our criticized assets in some, in energy are down by $1.7 billion. Within that, we moved more into non-performing in the quarter, which we had expected to do in our outlook as we sat here a quarter ago, which is why our reserve didn\u2019t have to go up in connection with that. ", "I think we\u2019re just a little -- it\u2019s a little premature to declare victory because prices are hovering in crude in the 40s and who knows what the next couple of quarters brings and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves there. We\u2019re performing great with 39 basis points of loss, all in with these levels, and so there is no point in declaring victory. We would agree, if I didn't mention, it was an oversight, there is a lot more access to capital among energy companies today, all forms, loans, high yield, high-grade and equity were busier in the second quarter than it have been in a while. There are more assets changing here, and things are freeing up a little bit and that's going to help with resolutions and we\u2019ve captured the benefit of that in our analysis for what our exposures are, but it\u2019s true and it was less true a couple of quarters ago.", "John Shrewsberry", "And Nancy, the other thing, John mentioned, but I just want a reminder or say it again, even though we added to our non-accruals, we tend to be conservative. Over 90% of our non-accrual oil and gas customers are still current on principal and interest payments, think about that. I mean, that's\u2026", "John Stumpf", "Almost all the losses that we\u2019ve taken are from loans that are still paying.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. So we are sort of targeting back to the performing non-performing era of a couple of decades ago.", "John Stumpf", "Yes.", "Nancy Bush", "I remember. Secondly, mortgage banking gain on sale, can you just give us the current margin and how that stacks up and if it\u2019s strengthening, I mean if refi activity goes up, I'm assuming that gain on sale margin will strengthen, can you just affirm that or not?", "John Shrewsberry ", "Yes. So it was sort of 165, 166 in the quarter and about the same from the first quarter. I think you're right that the industry is probably going to have some capacity constraints at this level of application activity and that's probably, it\u2019s at least supportive for levels that we are today. I don\u2019t know if it moves up from here, but it feels supportive because people are working hard to accomplish the throughput that these applications create.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. And just one final question, John Stumpf, you raised the dividend, what $0.02 I guess what last quarter, and you\u2019re sort of at the 37% payout ratio, et cetera, et cetera. When would be the next regular dividend meeting where you would consider a more meaningful dividend increase and given that your stock is one of the highest yielding in the group, is that necessary at this point?", "John Stumpf", "Well, we increased $0.05, right from $0.375 to $0.38 and I would remind as John did that and you just suggested that if you take $0.38 and divide that by $1.1, you get a number that is that we're proud about. We just went through our CCAR process and I hope you would agree and I know our investors appreciate the fact that we are shareholder friendly. We have -- of the big banks. We are a leader in returning capital. So dividends are important, speaks to the confidence of our -- of how we run the company and the earnings momentum that we have. On the other hand, buybacks are also important. So they\u2019re both in there and the question you asked, we think about that a lot. So, and we will continue to put all of our emphasis on running a really great business and returning as much capital as we can and we should -- and people should think about the 55% to 75% range.", "Nancy Bush", "Thanks for the artful non-answer, John.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Great, thanks. Just a quick question. When you look at the balance sheet, when you look at the kind of, on the liability side of the balance sheet, if you look at it year-on-year, you\u2019ve seen deposits up 60 billion, where most of the fundings come from short-term borrowings and long-term debt. So is there something changing in the depositor base or depositor is becoming more rate sensitive and that's why you\u2019re not seeing the deposit growth that you once were, especially this quarter where it\u2019s only been 4 billion on end of period for total deposits, just wondering if there is a change in the depositor.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. If there is anything specific, I would say it\u2019s among wholesale customers, I think retail deposits grew by 8% year-over-year and the total grew by 4% and the balance is coming from wholesale customers who are a little bit more price sensitive and in the wake of the 25 basis point move in December, there are some deposits that we paid a little bit more for in wholesale and some that we didn't, and some that have better liquidity value and some that have worse and this is how that\u2019s shaken out. ", "You pointed out that there has been some more wholesale funding on the liability side. We went out and put on some short-ish term, I think it shows up as long-term, because it's beyond the year, but short-ish term financing to make sure we had funding in place for the GES, as they came on, some of that will roll off, some of it might hang on too for a while. But it\u2019s a mix. And then as you also pointed out, we are out there marching along the TLAC implementation path and we will be over the course of the next several years, and that will add to that portion of the liability stack.", "John Stumpf", "Brian, we love all of our deposits and depositors, but if you look at as John mentioned, if you look at the most core of our core deposits, that would be retail and especially retail transaction deposits, savings accounts, checking accounts and if you look at our net primary, which where people live out of those accounts, you look at that growth and you look at the growth on the retail side, it's been world-class for us and that continues to march along.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "John Stumpf", "Thank you. I know we ran over, but I want to thank all of you for joining us today and your interest in Wells Fargo and your questions. So, and also I want to thank all of our 265,000 plus team members for a great quarter. Thank you much. See you next quarter.

As you know, on September 8, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Los Angeles city attorney related to sales practices in retail banking. I know that this is not the type of activity you expect from Wells Fargo and is certainly not what we expect from ourselves. We let down our customers, our shareholders, and our team members. We simply failed to fulfill our responsibility to all our stakeholders.", "Our vision of satisfying our customers\u2019 financial needs and helping them to succeed financially is about building lifelong relationships one customer at a time. The core values of Wells Fargo are as true today as they were a month ago, a year ago, and 164 years ago. However, we had serious problems in our retail bank where products became the focus rather than the relationships with our customers.", "Our senior management could have and should have done more. I'm fully committed along with the entire leadership team to fixing these issues and taking the necessary actions to restore our customers\u2019 trust.", "We have a specific action plan in place to lead our company forward during this period, which is focused on outreach to everyone who has been impacted by retail banking sales practices, including our customers, our team members, our investors, our regulators, elected officials, and the communities that we do business in. It includes being transparent in our communication, and we've included a lot of information in this quarterly supplement for you.", "On pages three and four, we provide some background regarding the sales practices settlements, along with details of the account review that was completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I believe most of these facts are familiar to you, but let me highlight a few key points.", "The 2.1 million consumer and small business accounts that were identified as accounts that may not have been authorized cost Wells Fargo much more than the $2.6 million of fees we received, which we have fully refunded. And let me clarify that these accounts had a de minimis impact to the retail banking household cross-sell ratio that we report on a quarterly basis with the maximum impact in any one quarter of 0.02 products per household or 0.3% of the reported metric. At no time were all of the identified accounts included in our reported cross-sell ratio, because unused deposit accounts rolled off.", "While the revenue generated was small relative to our annual income, and the impact on our cross-sell ratio was not material, the implications for our company and on the trust of our customers are significant. We\u2019ve made several changes to enhance our oversight, expand customer transparency, and improve the customer experience, which we highlight on page five.", "Effective October 1, we eliminated product sales goals for our retail banking team members; and next year, we will introduce a new performance plan based on updated metrics around customer service, growth, and risk management. We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of doing what is right for our customers and the elimination of product sales goals has been positively received by both our team members and our customers. And we\u2019ve made system and process enhancements, including sending automated emails, application acknowledgments, and multifactor authentication.", "We expect to spend a total of over $50 million this year enhanced quality assurance monitoring. We\u2019ve implemented an independent third-party mystery shopper program targeting 15,000 to 20,000 annual visits to our branches to test actual product purchase interactions. We\u2019ve added risk professionals to provide greater oversight and significantly expanded our customer complaint servicing and resolution process. We will continue to invest in process enhancements and product monitoring, a proactive monitoring, and we\u2019re committed to getting it right for our customers.", "We\u2019re reaching out to all retail and small business checking, savings, credit card, and unsecured line of credit customers, and we\u2019re asking them to contact us if they have any concerns about their accounts or any aspect of the relationship with Wells Fargo. We've dedicated resources available 24/7 for inquiries and questions.", "In cases where customers believe they have received a product that they did not want or authorize and they are not satisfied with our resolution, we\u2019re providing an option of mediation through a third-party that is convenient and free for the customer. Our team members are proactively calling a meeting with their customers in all areas of the company.", "Additionally, we\u2019ve been working on contacting the credit card customers identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. As a reminder, their analysis included all credit cards that were open, but not activated. There are a lot of reasons why customers don't activate their cards, so we\u2019re trying to contact all unactivated credit card customers with open accounts to confirm whether they want their credit cards.", "For consumer credit card customers identified, over half have closed their accounts, in part reflecting the passage of time as some of these accounts were opened five years ago. For those accounts that are still open, we\u2019ve called 166,000 un-activated customers so far and we\u2019ve spoken with 34,000 customers who have made a decision whether to keep or close their account. Of those customers, 17% have said that they did not apply for a credit card and 8% said that they did not recall applying for a credit card.", "We\u2019re also focused on determining potential additional impacts that the identified consumer and small business deposit and credit card customers may have incurred. We\u2019ve allocated significant resources to this effort. We\u2019re contracting with a third-party firm to work with us as well as with the primary credit card bureaus to develop a plan for submission to the regulators for their approval.", "Here's what we've learned so far. According to FICO, the impact on FICO scores from a credit card application varies based on a person's unique credit history. But, in general, credit inquiries have a small impact on FICO scores. For most people, one additional credit inquiry will take fewer than five points off their FICO scores for a period of up to 12 months.", "We\u2019re working on determining potential financial impact for customers who obtained a loan with Wells Fargo or another company during the 12-month period where their FICO score may have been impacted by the credit inquiry. For example, if the loan was from Wells Fargo, and the customer was impacted by a lower FICO score, we will adjust the line size, modify pricing, and refund any additional costs incurred. As we did with our original account analysis, in all circumstances, our intent is to err on the side of the customer and to make it right. We've been actively monitoring and tracking our customer activity since the announcement.", "In order to be as transparent as possible, on page nine, we are providing data to compare activity levels across a number of metrics in retail banking. When analyzing these trends versus the prior month, it\u2019s important to remember that September had two fewer business days this year than August.", "While it is too early to determine the long-term impact, and we\u2019re prepared for things to get worse before they get better, here's what we\u2019ve observed so far. Our customer traffic to our branches and call centers remained at typical levels for September. Customers calling and speaking to a phone banker are up 4% from a year ago. And so far, formal complaints related to sales practices have been less than 1% of the calls we\u2019ve received.", "Historically, approximately 70% of banker interactions are service, not sales related, and this percentage increased slightly in September. Customer visits with bankers in our branches, a subset of overall customer traffic, were down 10% in September compared with a year ago. The lower level of interactions in September was driven by lower internal referrals, decreased product offerings and reduced marketing.", "We have begun to reintroduce marketing and will be gradually increasing our marketing efforts throughout the coming months. The drivers of lower banker interactions also resulted in new consumer checking account openings declining 25% in September compared with openings in September a year ago. To put this in perspective, account openings were down 143,000 from a year ago on a base of 33.2 million accounts.", "We continue to have year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers, up 4.5% in September. As a reminder, primary checking customers are those who actively use their checking accounts and, therefore, this metric was not impacted by the accounts identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our deposit customers continue to use their accounts with balances up $6.5 billion in September compared with August and debit card transactions up 9% from a year ago.", "Lower referrals, marketing and product offerings also impacted credit card applications, which were down 20% in September compared with September a year ago. Applications were down 77,000 from a year ago compared with 7.8 million total active cards. We continue to see increased usage among our customers with active cards up 9%, balances up 10%, and transaction volume also up 10% from a year ago.", "We are also actively monitoring customer experience scores with over 80,000 branch customer surveys completed in September. Loyalty scores in September were down from an all-time high in August, but were consistent with where they were as recently as two years ago. We also asked customers about the quality of their most recent branch visit. The score in September was down from August, but was also consistent with two years ago. Our enhanced focus on service seeks to bring these scores back to pre-settlement levels as we work to rebuild confidence and trust with our customers.", "We\u2019re also tracking the impact from the announcement on our other businesses, which we highlight on page ten. Mortgage referrals from retail banking, which account for 10% of our year-to-date mortgage originations, were down 24% from August to September. Auto originations have been minimally impacted since over 90% of our originations were through the indirect channel in the third quarter. We remain focused on maintaining our deep and long tenured dealer relationship, which drive most of our origination volume in our auto business.", "Within wholesale banking, our team members are actively meeting with customers and responding to their concerns. There have been a few state treasurers and municipalities who have made public announcements about temporarily suspending certain business activity with Wells Fargo, while several others have reaffirmed the relationship with us.", "Overall, we did not see any meaningful change of business trends in wholesale banking late in the quarter and deposit balances were up 4% during the month of September and loan pipelines were in line with the second quarter. We've also seen minimal impact so far within our wealth and investment management business. September-ending deposit balances were up 1% from August month-end and up 11% from a year ago. Client transaction activity was muted in September, but largely reflected the market environment. Retail brokerage advisory flows in September were strong, up $1.6 billion from August.", "September closed referred investment assets \u2013 these are the referrals resulting from the Wells community banking partnership \u2013 were more than $1 billion, in line with prior trends. But these referred assets are dependent on banker referrals, so we will be watching this trend very closely.", "We\u2019ve always believed that our team members are our most important asset. And it\u2019s been disturbing to hear claims of retaliations against team members who contacted the ethics line. We are investigating these claims. We are also assisting former team members who left retail banking due to sales performance and who remain eligible for rehire and applying for available positions at the company.", "Leaders throughout Wells Fargo have had ongoing regular outreach with their teams throughout our markets. Mary Mack, who was the new head of community banking, has met with team members in ten cities so far to gather ideas, concerns and questions from frontline retail managers at all levels to help inform the go-forward strategy for a service-driven community bank.", "Eight additional executive officers and their leadership teams met with more than 116,000 team members across the country. During these meetings, we\u2019re reinforcing our code of ethics, business conduct, ethics line and non-retaliation policies.", "We\u2019re also shifting our language in retail banking training and communications to make it more customer focused, less sales focused, and reinforcing our commitment to do what's right for our customers.", "We offer all of our team members competitive pay and benefits, which we highlight on slide 12. For example, tellers and customer service representatives earn at least $12 an hour, 60% above the federal minimum wage. 99% of team members are eligible for company-sponsored health benefits and our benefits programs cover more than 515,000 team members, spouses, domestic partners and their dependents.", "We believe that team member engagement is critical to our success. In each spring, our team members have the opportunity to take an anonymous survey administered through Gallup. It's a chance for our team members to share their perspective on what it's like to work at Wells Fargo.", "In 2016, over 90% of eligible team members participated in a survey and Wells Fargo's overall engagement scores were above 88% of the companies represented in Gallup's database. While we ranked high on the survey, this is not a mechanism \u2013 the only mechanism to identify team member concerns, like sales practices, and we\u2019re implementing other ways for our team members to share their views with management.", "Our team members are active in the communities where they live and work. And in 2015, the United Way ranked our workplace giving campaign the largest in the US for the seventh year in a row. We\u2019ve just finished our 2016 campaign last week. And during the time that has been very challenging for our company, our team members demonstrated their continued support for their communities. The preliminary contribution results are similar to last year.", "We\u2019re also committed to team member development. And last year, we invested $300 million in team member training in credit, risk, technology and customer service. Additionally, we provided $21 million in tuition reimbursement. As we move through this period, we will continue to be transparent regarding trends across the company.", "John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Our strong financial results in the third quarter were relatively straightforward. And in order to allow extra time to take questions, my prepared remarks regarding our results will be shorter than usual.", "I want to start on page 13 with a few key takeaways from our third quarter results, which reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and the momentum across many of our businesses. For the 16th consecutive quarter, we generated earnings of greater than $5 billion. Our loan, investment and deposit balances are all at record levels. Compared with the second quarter, we grew revenue driven by growth in net interest income. Many of our businesses had their best non-interest income results in five quarters, including strong mortgage banking results.", "We grew revenue despite equity gains being at five-quarter lows and $780 million lower than a year ago. Expense growth was driven by higher operating losses and the contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. Credit quality improved including lower losses in our oil and gas portfolio and our capital position remains strong as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders.", "Turning to page 15, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We grew loans and deposits and our liquidity and capital remained strong. Our funding sources grew in the third quarter with long-term debt up $10.9 billion on $20 billion of issuances, including $9.2 billion that we anticipate will be TLAC eligible.", "We also had strong deposit growth, up $330.4 billion from the second quarter. We purchased $57 billion of securities during the quarter, primarily agency MBS in our available-for-sale portfolio. The amount of securities purchased was higher than in prior quarters, but wasn't outsize when factoring in that we did not add duration in the loan portfolio with interest rate swaps as we had in prior quarters. We remain asset sensitive and will benefit if rates increase.", "Turning to the income statement overview on page 16, revenue increased $166 million from second quarter, with net interest income up $219 million. The slight decline in non-interest income was driven by a $303 million reduction in market sensitive revenue, which is at its lowest level in the past five quarters and a decrease in other income reflecting the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business last quarter.", "The $402 million increase in expenses from second quarter was primarily driven by $243 million increase in operating losses on higher litigation accruals. We also had a $107 million contribution to the foundation during the quarter. I will provide more detail on expenses later on the call.", "As shown on page 17, loans grew 6% from a year ago and were up $4.1 billion from the second quarter. Commercial loans grew $1.9 billion from the second quarter on higher commercial real estate and C&I loans. Consumers loans were up $2.2 billion with growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit cards, student lending and securities based lending.", "On page 18, we highlight year-over-year loan growth. I'm not going to highlight each portfolio, but as you can see on this page, we had strong and broad-based growth across many of our commercial and consumer portfolios.", "As highlighted on page 19, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter, up $62.6 billion or 5% from a year ago and included 8% growth in consumer and small business banking deposits. Our average deposit cost was stable with second quarter at 11 basis points and up 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain wholesale banking customers.", "Page 20 highlights our revenue diversification. Our results continued to benefit from our growth in earning assets and our diversified business model.", "Net interest income was up $219 million or 2% from the second quarter, reflecting earning asset growth and one additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by growth in long-term debt and deposits, partially offset by the benefit of earning asset growth. Net interest income grew 4% from a year ago, even with a 14 basis point reduction in NIM.", "Non-interest income declined $53 million from the second quarter, which included a $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business and declined $42 million from a year ago, which included $780 million of higher gains from equity investments. Across a number of our fee businesses, we had the best results in five quarters, including deposit accounts, trust and investment, mortgage banking and lease income.", "Our mortgage banking results reflected strong residential and commercial mortgage originations. Residential origination volume was $70 billion, up $15 billion or 27% from a year ago and up $7 billion from the second quarter, which is typically the strongest quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market.", "Applications were up 5% from second quarter and we ended the third quarter with a $50 billion unclosed pipeline, the highest since second quarter of 2013. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgages was 181 basis points in the third quarter, up 15 basis points from the second quarter. Given our strong pipeline at the end of the third quarter, we currently expect origination volume in the fourth quarter to be up from a year ago, but down slightly from the third quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. And we currently expect the production margin in the fourth quarter to be at or above the upper end of the range of the past five quarters, which was 188 basis points.", "As shown on page 23, expenses increased $402 million from the second quarter, driven by $243 million of higher operating losses, reflecting increased litigation accruals. Operating losses could continue to increase related to outstanding legal matters such as sales practice issues as we\u2019ve disclosed in our 10-K filing RMBS. $125 million in higher salaries due to an extra day in the quarter and FTE growth, $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation and higher FDIC insurance expense, reflecting the increase in deposit assessments.", "Expenses also reflected lower foreclosed asset expense from commercial foreclosed asset recoveries and lower commissions and incentive compensation expense reflecting the forfeiture of unvested equity awards from John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt. Our efficiency ratio was 59.4% in the third quarter and we expect the efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level.", "While our expenses increased this quarter, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth, which we highlight on page 24. We focused on reducing non-core businesses in order to simplify our organization and improve our risk profile. We\u2019re also working on creating a simpler and more collaborative way to seamlessly serve customers and team members by aligning similar teams in areas like marketing, finance and operations. We've also been reducing discretionary spending such as travel and facilities.", "Earlier this week, we announced the formation of a new payments virtual solutions and innovation group that will be led by Avid Modjtabai. This new group will bring teams from across the company together to accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products. This new group includes our innovation, consumer credit card, deposit products, treasury management and virtual channels teams.", "We continue to be active in providing our customers new products, services and technologies. For example, starting in the third quarter, customers can now send and receive real-time payments with any customer of a bank that participates in clearXchange network and our wholesale customers can now send and receive same day ACH.", "We\u2019re also making it easier for our customers to open accounts through mobile channels including brokerage, business direct, and personal credit products.", "Turning to our business segments starting on page 25, community banking earned $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter. The decline from a year ago was due to the lower gains on equity investments. We've already discussed earlier on the call, many of the business trends within community banking, so I'll just briefly highlight that our customers continued to actively use our payment and digital products with debit card transaction volume up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase dollar volume also up 8%. Mobile active users grew to 18.8 million.", "Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 1% from the second quarter. Revenue was $7.1 billion, down 2% from the second quarter due to the gain last quarter on the sale of our health benefits services business. Revenue benefited from record net interest income, up 4% from second quarter and 12% from a year ago.", "Loan growth was driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $48.7 billion or 12% from a year ago, the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. During the third quarter, we closed a portion of our acquisition of GE Capital's commercial distribution finance business. And earlier this month, we completed the final phase of [indiscernible].", "Wealth and investment management earned a record $677 million in the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago and up 16% from the second quarter. WIM generated a pretax margin of 27% in the third quarter and had positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis.", "Positive operating leverage was driven by solid revenue growth, while continuing to invest more in the business. WIM\u2019s average deposits were up 10% from a year ago and average loans increased 12%, the 13th consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Client assets across WIM reached record highs this quarter driven both by market gains and continued positive net flows.", "Turning to page 28, credit results improved from second quarter with only 33 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs declined $119 million or from second quarter from lower oil and gas, credit card and consumer real estate losses, and continued commercial real estate recoveries.", "Non-performing assets decreased $1.1 billion from second quarter with improvement across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. Non-performing assets were only 1.25% of total loans, the lowest level since the merger with Wachovia in 2008. And for the first time this year, we did not have a reserve build.", "Slide 29 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstandings declined to $16 billion, down 6% from second quarter, and there were no defensive draws again this quarter. Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was down 2% from the second quarter and down 11% from a year ago. We had $168 million of net charge-offs in the oil and gas portfolio in the third quarter, down $95 million or 36% from the second quarter, driven by improvements in industry conditions.", "Non-accrual loans were $2.5 billion, down slightly from the second quarter, and criticize loans declined $1.1 billion or 13%. While another decline in commodity prices would have a negative impact on the performance of our oil and gas portfolio, given the current environment, we believe losses peaked in the second quarter.", "Turning the page 30, our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in at 10.7% in the third quarter. Our net payout ratio was 61% as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases.", "Regarding the new Fed proposal for the stress capital buffer, while the initial information provided by the Fed was limited, we have performed our internal analysis and the potential impact appears manageable and the overall changes to CCAR framework are generally aligned with our expectations.", "I also want to provide an update on where we stand related to TLAC. As I mentioned earlier, we issued $9.2 billion of debt in the quarter that we anticipate will be TLAC eligible. However, this was partially offset by $2.1 billion of long-term debt rolling into the less than one-year maturity bucket.", "In summary, our results in the third quarter demonstrated strength and momentum in a number of businesses. However, the impact on future performance from the sales practices related events late in the quarter is still unknown. We\u2019re working closely with our customers, our regulators and our team members to move forward and make things right.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thanks, John. Before we end our prepared remarks, I wanted to address a few of the most common questions that we\u2019ve been getting from all of you. The first is whether Wells Fargo's culture is broken. Our goal of building lifelong relationships with our customers and appropriately offering them additional products is still the foundation of our business model. But there was clearly something wrong and we will make the necessary changes to fix it.", "The values we've always embraced, people as a competitive advantage, doing what is right for our customers, diversity and inclusion, ethics and leadership will continue to guide our company through this challenging period.", "Second, we\u2019ve received questions about the sales practice activities, who was involved and what the timeline of events was. We have acknowledged that we've made mistakes. However, our board is conducting an independent investigation into our retail banking sales practices and related matters and we\u2019re not in a position to discuss those topics today.", "Finally, we know there is uncertainty due to the events that have occurred over the last month, including this week. Let me outline what you should expect from us before we have our next earnings call 90 days from now.", "First, in our retail banking business, we\u2019ll continue our outreach efforts to our customers and focus on making things right.", "Second, we will continue to work with the board on their investigation as well as all the other inquiries we have received, including meeting the required deliverables under the consent orders.", "And third, as you\u2019ve heard on the call today, we\u2019re committed to being transparent regarding business trends and you should expect updates on these activities during the quarter. We\u2019re also planning on an off-cycle investor day for next year where we will update you on our business strategies.", "And finally, I know there is a lot we need to get right. And make no mistake, I get it and our team is on it.", "Jim Rowe ", "Before we open up the line for questions, for today, to be as fair as possible, we\u2019re asking that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up, so we can get to as many questions as possible. Thank you. And with that, Regina, we\u2019re ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Timothy Sloan", "Hi, Matt.", "Operator", "Matt, you may be on mute.", "Matt O'Connor", "Sorry, can you hear me?", "Timothy Sloan", "We can hear you now, Matt. Thanks.", "Matt O'Connor", "Okay. Apologies. I thought I saw a blurb out there that you\u2019re hiring 2,000 employees for various compliance controls areas. And I just want to see if that is true. And then related to that, as you think about the expense impact of all of this, any estimates on what that might be?", "Timothy Sloan", "Matt, the blurb really reflected the fact that we\u2019re moving approximately 2,000 of our team members that are in risk and control positions within our business lines to our corporate risk functions. Its\u2019 not necessarily a net increase in the number of team members.", "Matt O'Connor", "Okay. So, I guess, the broader question is, there\u2019s going to be some cost impact of the sales practice issue, probably some revenue impact as well. And do you have any estimates on what that might be. The revenue impact is probably a little bit trickier. But I would think there may be some way to frame some early thoughts on the cost side of things.", "Timothy Sloan", "It\u2019s tough to be specific because we will definitely be adding people in control positions as we build out the go-forward plan and have it agreed to by our regulators. So that\u2019s definitely a cost headwind. And I guess I would calibrate the relevant range in the tens of millions of dollars for that, specifically as it relates to this. And I think you're right on the revenue side. Some of the early trends that we\u2019re seeing just in terms of account openings etc. don't really have a revenue impact. They may ultimately, with respect to how incremental deposits are redeployed or transactional activity in cards, things like that, but they don't have an immediate revenue impact on this quarter, next quarter. The bigger picture, of course, some people have asked is, what will the business model feel like in community banking with a more service oriented culture rather than a more sales oriented culture. And you'll be hearing more about that as it\u2019s fully developed. It\u2019s our intention to to be successful in providing all of our customers with what they need in terms of financial products through a service oriented model. So that'll take some time to develop and to describe for people. And then it will work its way in over the course of the coming quarters, but it\u2019s a question that people have asked and it\u2019s one that we\u2019ll provide a lot of transparency around, so that people can understand the impact of that change as it\u2019s being made.", "Matt O'Connor", "So these costs and then any revenue give-up, do you feel like it\u2019s going to be absorbable in your current earnings power? Or I think the fear out there in the market is not just the headline risk, which will go away at some point, but I think the fear is kind of this $4 plus of earnings power, is that meaningfully at risk when you factor in some of the costs and revenue reduction, and I don\u2019t know if you can comment on that? Thank you.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thank you. It\u2019s tough to say with specificity. We have a very diversified revenue model as you know. There\u2019s so much coming from wholesale. There\u2019s so much coming from WIM. This will be a headwind in community banking. And it\u2019s one that we\u2019ll intend to absorb. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re upping our transparency, so that people can develop their own sense and we can share facts as they\u2019re happening.", "Matt O'Connor", "Thank you.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning, Erika.", "Erika Najarian", "Good morning. Maybe I can ask Matt\u2019s last question another way. You said return goals during investor day of 1.1% to 1.4% ROA. And I guess, really what the question is, is given the uncertainty of the community bank impact on revenue and expenses going forward, are there other levers within Wells Fargo in that you can deliver that 1.1% to 1.4% ROA within the next two years and can you grow earnings without any help from macro next year despite this uncertainty?", "Timothy Sloan", "Erika, it's a very fair question. And let me take the macro orientation of that first. It's always a function of what the economic environment is and what the interest rate environment is. But I think if you\u2019ve seen from our third quarter results that the other businesses that drive this company performed quite well in the quarter. And we\u2019re excited about their growth. But as John indicated, it's a little bit sooner to rate in terms of what the impact, the longer-term impact of the sales practices issues are going to be within community banking. But, boy, I'm very optimistic about the leadership of Mary Mack, very optimistic about our ability to work through those. But it's going to take a while. And as we said, it could get a little bit worse before it gets better. But I\u2019ll tell you, the team in community banking is up to it.", "John Shrewsberry", "I think those \u2013 what we announced at the last investor day in terms of targets are still a reasonable guideposts. I said just a little bit earlier, I think we\u2019ll still be at the higher end on expenses. And, of course, now in addition to what we just talked about with Matt about compliance costs, we\u2019re going to have incremental operating losses as a result of this litigation etc. That\u2019s got to work its way through. And that will definitely be around for a little while. As Tim mentioned, we\u2019re going to have an off-cycle investor day next May. And between now and then, we'll be talking a lot. And if we think that those aren\u2019t reasonable guideposts anymore, we\u2019ll tell people.", "Erika Najarian", "And my second \u2013 my follow-up question, part of your stock\u2019s appeal has always been the dividend and the overall capital return, and I'm wondering if some of the overhang from these issues from litigation, from potential DoJ investigation impact how you think about capital return going forward?", "Timothy Sloan", "Overall, it doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ve provided similar metrics in terms of the range of capital payout, and we are well within those this quarter, and our expectation is to continue to stay in those ranges.", "John Shrewsberry", "We certainly account for a broad range of stressed outcomes in the capital planning process as it relates to operational risk and operational losses. That\u2019s always been true. And it\u2019s true for other filers as well. So it will certainly be our intention to take a similar path going forward with the approach to distribution that we\u2019ve had.", "Erika Najarian", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "You next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hey, good morning. Hey, could you give us a sense as to why you chose Mary Mack to run the retail bank and give us a sense as to what she's bringing from the wealth management platform, from anything she's done at Wachovia and what your expectations are for how she\u2019s going to deliver?", "Timothy Sloan", "All good questions. First, Mary was the best person for the job. I could not be more excited about what she's been able to accomplish in this environment thus far. She brings experience not only within the brokerage business, but also in the retail banking business. And my expectations are very high and I hope she's listening because they\u2019re high and I'm pretty certain that she's going to be able to exceed the expectations. But she was the best person for the job.", "Betsy Graseck", "But is that \u2013 can you just give us a sense why \u2013 we\u2019re looking for a culture shift or culture enhancement, change in the business model, and that\u2019s a big ask. So I'm just wondering if \u2013 what you saw in her at \u2013 while she was running wealth management?", "Timothy Sloan", "Betsy, I saw an executive with decades of experience in the financial services industry and decades of experience at Wachovia and Wells Fargo, who's been through a variety of challenges in her career and who is an incredibly effective leader and somebody who I believe in, and our entire senior leadership team and the board believe, that who can effectuate the change that is needed on our retail banking platform.", "Betsy Graseck", "And is there opportunities to enhance the efficiency of that platform over time, not in the next several quarters as you work with the outreach with your clients, but over time given the digital investments spend that you've been making and I think given the fact you\u2019ve been running them as separate geographies, so maybe I'm wrong there, maybe very centralized.", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, the short answer is yes. And we talked about that a fair amount at investor day and we talked about it as part of an omni-channel experience. Our customers continue to use our branches as frequently today as they have a month ago, a year ago and so on. But having said, there is incredible opportunities to continue to improve our product set, how we offer convenience to our customers, how our products and our people interact with each other. And, candidly, that's one of the reasons why we announced on Monday the creation of the payments virtual 20 channel and innovation group. And if you want to ask why we picked Avid for that because she was the best person for the job. And that change, I think, I want to just reinforce is very important because what we've done is we've brought together all of the payments businesses, how so many of our customers, both retail and commercial, interact with us every day, we brought them all together. And we think that\u2019s going to create a fair amount of innovation, but also efficiency over time.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, thank you.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "Good morning.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning, John.", "John Pancari", "Just want to go to the wholesale impact. I know you commented on the select states, municipalities that have made some decisions to pullback business. Could you just clarify again, which states and municipalities have indicated \u2013 I believe, it was California. We\u2019ve also seen Chicago. And I believe Seattle. And then how we should think about that impact. Can you help us quantify the amount of revenue that you generally generate from that type of business?", "Timothy Sloan", "Sure. John, I'll start. Maybe John will want to jump in. I don't have a list of all the states and municipalities that have either indicated they want to put us on a temporary pause or those that have reaffirmed their business with us. In our investor day materials, we broke out the revenue associated with our government and institutional banking business. One of the benefits that we have at Wells Fargo is that we have these diversified set of businesses, and so frequently in our list of 90 different businesses, not every one of them is necessarily material in any one quarter to the impact of the company. Having said that, our goal is to earn all that business back. Those states and municipalities had chosen to do business with Wells Fargo for a reason. We have great people. We have great products. Are we disappointed that they decided to put us on suspension or pause? We are. But given the environment, it's not surprising. And we respect their decisions. But we\u2019re going to work hard to make things right within the company to earn that business back over time.", "John Pancari", "Okay. All right. Thanks. And the separately, back on to the cost side, I know you flagged the legal costs for the quarter and then you also alluded to a more focused marketing effort, I want to see if you have any way to help us quantify those two items at least for the near term. And then separately, the offsets that could come on the expense side to those types of items, I believe you allude to branch consolidation potential later on in your slide deck as well as the travel that you flagged on your comments, so wanted to see how we could think about the timing of that type of relief from those items.", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. So this is John. There\u2019s a lot of puts and takes there, which is why we usually revert back to the efficiency ratio of target because while we\u2019re definitely going to have elevated compliance related costs and operational loss related costs, we\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives underway, some of which you alluded to. Some are immediate and some are over the forecast horizon of a couple of years. And it\u2019s designed to keep us in or below the high-end of 55% to 59%. So my guidance at this point is that we\u2019re going to be at the high end of that range accounting for all of those things that we\u2019re showing as levers in order to offset the elevated expense.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And no quantification of the legal costs this quarter, correct?", "John Shrewsberry", "It\u2019s difficult to do. It\u2019s very early for the matters that we filed in our 8-K and that you\u2019re reading about in the newspaper. And as those things mature over time, then they\u2019ll begin to have an impact. But they don\u2019t have a dollar impact yet.", "John Pancari", "Okay. Thanks, John.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning, John.", "John McDonald", "Hi. Good morning. Tim, I know it's early here, but maybe you could talk about what factors are you going to be balancing when you redesign the sales incentive scorecard? How are you going to make sure you don't overshoot and cut off legitimate needs-based selling and relationship building while also making sure you don't encourage the wrong behavior?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yeah, it\u2019s a good question, John. I think the focus is going to be, first, on \u2013 and this is a little bit high level, but I'm thinking about what are the drivers of developing those lifelong relationships with our customers. It\u2019s about service. It's about convenience. So think about our bankers being incented to provide good service, and so we\u2019ll be measuring that on an independent basis, to think about our bankers being focused on helping our customers do more business, but being measured on product usage and activity as opposed to individual product sales and also about an overall growth in assets and balances and also think about it being much more driven to a team approach as opposed to just on an individual basis. We think that that is going to be successful. Now, Mary and team are working on the specifics of that right now and when we complete the analysis and they recommend the program, that's one of the other areas that we\u2019ll provide some transparency about.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And then, so a follow-up for John, on the net interest margin and net interest income, when we try to assess the impact of what a potential rate hike would do, one rate hike, it\u2019s hard to discern what happened after the December hike last time because the first quarter, you had a few moving parts. What\u2019s your best guess of kind of what kind of help you get to your NIM from one rate hike? And then what\u2019s the ongoing impact to NIM on the side of \u2013 from TLAC issuance in terms of drag?", "John Shrewsberry", "The net number that I would look to for ease of modeling if we got one 25 basis point move would be something on the order of $150 million per quarter in the first year. There\u2019s a lot going into that in terms of asset liability mix, loan growth, deposit growth, TLAC issuance, etc. But that\u2019s a reasonable placeholder that accounts for the net.", "John McDonald", "Okay, thank you.", "John Shrewsberry", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Company. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning, Paul.", "Paul Miller", "Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you very much. Hey, relative to some of the shakeup, you guys had an executive leadership. Has there been any thought to bring somebody from the outside? Because a lot of you guys have been with the bank for multiple, multiple years. And to bring somebody from the outside to give a fresh look of the culture.", "Timothy Sloan", "It\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s one we've been getting. I think the board, by the changes that we\u2019ve made over the last week and a few weeks is comfortable with and very supportive of the management team. I think over the last few years, really since the financial crisis, we had a huge opportunity years ago to reset the entire team and we selected the best folks that were available for all the roles. Since then, one of the great things about the company has been how we\u2019ve been able to attract many senior leaders from outside the company, not only in our business lines, but also in many of our support functions, including corporate risk. So that's already really happened from my perspective.", "Paul Miller", "Hello?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yeah, you there? Go ahead.", "Paul Miller", "I'm sorry. And then, on the independent audit, is there any timeline for that? Did you disclose who is doing the audit?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, it\u2019s an investigation that\u2019s being spearheaded by Shearman & Sterling, which is working on behalf of the board. It\u2019s independent and we don't have a date by which it\u2019s going to be finished. Hopefully, it will be finished as soon as practical, but I think independence and thoroughness is much more important than getting something done in a short period of time.", "Paul Miller", "Hey, guys. Thank you very much for taking my questions.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thank you, Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning, Mike.", "Mike Mayo", "Hi. Of the 115,000 accounts that were open without authorization and charged to fee, how many customers did those 115,000 accounts reflect? And what\u2019s been your retention rate of those customers?", "Timothy Sloan", "I think the customer count is somewhat lower than the incidence of the product count at least. With respect to the $1.5 million deposit accounts, which is the bigger number, but the ones that couldn\u2019t be rolled out. That\u2019s related to 1.1 million customers. So it was a 3:2 ratio there. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s somewhat south of a 100,000 customers for the 115,000 impacted accounts. And the retention ratio \u2013 I don\u2019t have the retention ratio at hand. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s independently being measured, at least not at this level.", "Mike Mayo", "I guess, a follow-up, this is a long wind-up here, but it\u2019s a little frustrating not getting that retention [indiscernible] the customers that were impacted the most, what\u2019s been your retention rate. I guess we can\u2019t really ask about the internal investigation. There\u2019s no timeframe. We can\u2019t ask who knew what and when. We can\u2019t ask why it took so long to stop the problem. This is the first time we\u2019ve had to ask a question on the call. We don\u2019t have Steve Sanger on this call. And so, it\u2019s a long wind-up like I said. A little bit more on potential branch closings. Slide, I guess, 24, you talk about, it could allow you to review the branch footprint for consolidation opportunities. 6000 branches. You\u2019re having success with digital delivery and it\u2019s exciting that Avid is promoted into this new position. I'm sure you\u2019ll look at that. Can you give us something concrete as relates to all this? Maybe when you look at the new chapter, what the potential might be for efficiency improvements, especially if you\u2019re telling us efficiency should be elevated for some time?", "Timothy Sloan", "Mike, listen, I appreciate your question. And as one of the many stakeholders at Wells Fargo, I'm sorry that we've disappointed you. But we just spent 30 minutes talking about what\u2019s going on at the company and we provided a lot of information. We provided new slides that provide a tremendous amount of detail on some of the retail sales practices issue and we deliberately and diligently walked through the performance of all of our businesses. And you know what, if that doesn\u2019t satisfy you, I am sorry.", "Mike Mayo", "All right. Well, maybe at the next year\u2019s investor day, do you think we\u2019ll hear more about how you\u2019ll configure your branches and kind of the next stage of that?", "Timothy Sloan", "Sure, absolutely. We talked about that at our last investor day. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we want to accelerate the timing of our investor day because we want to provide increased transparency which we\u2019ve done today and we want to provide a more continuous updates as to how we are operating the company.", "Mike Mayo", "All right. Well, I look forward to the incremental updates that you give. Thanks.", "Timothy Sloan", "Likewise.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies and Company. Please go ahead.", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks a lot. I was wondering if we could just talk about the environment a little bit. Loan growth was okay, but, certainly, we've seen this kind of air pocket on the commercial side a little bit from the industry perspective. And I'm wondering if you could just talk about what you guys are seeing in terms of commercial demand, especially? And if you\u2019re seeing any just noted changes in terms of customer activity and whether you think that's either fleeting or whether you guys are a taking a different view of the extension or credit at all?", "Timothy Sloan", "I think, overall, in the wholesale businesses, as you said, every quarter can be a little bit different in terms of loan growth. We didn't see any trends in any of our wholesale businesses that would cause us concern that commercial real estate loans are going one way or asset-based loans are going another. One of the reasons why our loan growth in the third quarter was in commercial wasn't as strong as in prior quarter is because our energy book declined by \u2013 I can't recall exact figure \u2013 $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We\u2019re still very active in the energy industry. But it makes sense that there is a bit of a decline there. We had a few kind of larger underwritings that either paid off or were transformed into long-term debt or equity for our customers, but nothing alarming from our perspective.", "Ken Usdin", "All right. And then to follow-up, John, I noticed that the securities book was $390 billion at the end of the quarter. It looks like you're moving some of that liquidity and maybe also replacement of some of that loan growth. Can you just talk about the reinvestment philosophy? What kind of stuff you're investing in? And are you able to find a good ROA, ROE on moving the book into securities at this time, given where rates are?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. Well, the first call on that liquidity would be loans that we just talked about to the extent that there was incremental loan demand. We\u2019ve \u2013 versus how we\u2019ve deployed liquidity in the past, we, obviously, have more of a bias toward things that qualify for HQLA just because of the environment that we\u2019re living in for liquidity. So you\u2019ve seen a lot of agency mortgage-backed securities. You\u2019ve seen some treasuries. We\u2019ve actually got a program of late to be a little bit more active in the Ginnie Mae securities because of their liquidity properties. We also have a portfolio of \u2013 a smaller portfolio on the security side are somewhat more credit sensitive, so high-grade corporates or CMBS, things like that we replenish every quarter as well. The returns are okay and we have this lower for longer bias that makes us comfortable deploying capital in that way and liquidity in that way and the capital to withstand what happens if we\u2019re wrong about rates and we end up in a higher rate environment. But it\u2019s consistent with the approach that we\u2019ve taken over the last couple of quarters. We paused in the first quarter while there was a real, real drop in \u2013 it was market volatility that gave rise to risk-free rates going as well as they have. But now in the second quarter and the third quarter, we\u2019ve been back to converting cash into duration basically.", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks, John.", "John Shrewsberry", "That helpful?", "Ken Usdin", "Yep.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.", "Brian Foran", "Good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about overdraft charges. A few articles out there have kind of maybe asserted some of the opt-in processes were over-zealous, let's call it, at the retail network, so is that something you've looked at as part of your review? And then, we don't get a ton of history from the reg filings, but it is broken out now. It seems like your overdraft was running about 12%, plus 12% year-over-year in terms of growth which is a good bit stronger than the industry, so even separate from any of the sales practice stuff, maybe just what was driving that kind of overdraft fee growth?", "Timothy Sloan", "Sure, Brian. We saw some of the same reports that you did. And, candidly, those were a little bit of a surprise. Having said that, like all facets of our retail banking business, we\u2019re going to review those. And to the extent there any issues, we will deal with them. But we\u2019re not aware today that they were a driver of overdraft income.", "Brian Foran", "Great. And then maybe on some of these new account production metrics, it's very helpful. I appreciate the disclosure. I'm assuming the average life of checking accounts and credit cards is pretty long, so is there like a rule of thumb translation you can give us? If the run rate of new accounts is down 25% for six months, let's say, is that a 1 percentage point headwind to balance growth, 2 percentage points? How should we think about that in terms of thinking about balance growth, all else equal over the next two years?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yeah. I would separate that into credit cards, one, and deposit accounts, second. I think credit cards it's a little bit tricky just because over the last few years we\u2019ve seen such gross in our credit card business in terms of penetration and our usage numbers have been good. But you could imagine a point where there \u2013 if credit card growth is down a little bit that in a year or so from now that we could see some decline. But, of course, that assumes that we don't make any other changes in our credit card products, in our offerings, how we interact with customers and the like. So don\u2019t have a great rule of thumb there. And, again, as it relates to the deposit accounts \u2013 and, John, jump in here if you feel differently \u2013 we\u2019re so new into the impact. And what we tried to do in the expanded disclosure is show you the decline in a monthly basis, but also give you a sense of what the impact was on the total base. I think that's how I would think about it. And I appreciate that you appreciated our increased disclosure.", "Brian Foran", "Thank you.", "John Shrewsberry", "And I guess the only thing I would add is that not all deposit accounts are equal in terms of the contribution to deposit balances. I think we have deposits growing by $6 billion when we have new accounts not opening as quickly.", "Timothy Sloan", "Brian, that\u2019s another reason why we want to continue to provide enhanced disclosure because we want to make sure that you are comfortable with how any of the headwinds we\u2019re facing right now are affecting business.", "Brian Foran", "Thank you, both.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning, Eric.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I guess my question gets back to, sadly, to the account issue. But can you describe if there's been any review of interactions and communications about these kinds of issues with the board? And just to sort of get to my follow-up, what I'm really wondering is, if this raises the risk of qualitative review, as it relates to CCAR or any other kind of regulatory action?", "Timothy Sloan", "So let me take the first part of that question. As I mentioned, the board has engaged Shearman & Sterling to do an investigation of retail sales product issues and other matters. And we want to be very respectful of their process. And we want that process to be taken seriously and to be viewed independently. So I don't want to comment on the specifics of how they\u2019re going to go about their review. But we look forward to\u2026", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Sorry to interrupt, but I guess I'm getting to the issue of \u2013 it seemed like at least from the press reports, this issue went on for several years before management made the board aware and I'm just wondering if that issue has been addressed.", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, here's how I would answer that and that is there\u2019s going to be an independent review and I think that it would be appropriate to wait for the independent review as opposed to jumping to conclusion about what media might think. I don't mean to be disrespectful to the media, but I don't know if they have all the facts and the review will look at all the facts and will make some recommendations, I'm sure.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks.", "Timothy Sloan", "Hi, Marty.", "Marty Mosby", "Hey. You created a new role on the board, a Vice Chair, and you put Elizabeth Duke in that role and appointed her there. She has an extensive amount of industry and regulatory experience. You created that role for a purpose. Can you frame that a little bit for us and let us understand better what you \u2013 how you expect to leverage her in that role?", "Timothy Sloan", "Sure. Marty, I want to be very respectful of the fact that neither John nor I created that role, the board did. First, we have a terrific board. It\u2019s diverse in terms of the types of industries that they\u2019ve been involved in, their experience, and we just couldn't be more pleased with the quality of that board, in particular, having both Steve Sanger and Betsy being \u2013 Betsy Duke being willing to step up into these roles is I think absolutely the right decision that the board should be making in the circumstance. Separating the CEO and Chairman role is something that we've done in the past. But, again, in particular to Betsy, to have somebody like that with not only industry experience, but also regulatory experience in this environment to provide assistance for Steve is exactly what\u2019s needed.", "Marty Mosby", "And then not to Monday morning quarterback or rehash what you've done in the past, but, Tim, I really wanted to ask you, what, in this experience, has changed the way you think about the role of CEO, as you now assume it, and Wells Fargo as a company or a culture? And what is the key takeaway? Whenever you go through these extreme crises, there's always something that you've learned that will make the company better as you move forward. What have you learned that you're going to now take to the \u2013 your new role and be able to push forward?", "Timothy Sloan", "Marty, that\u2019s a great question. And by the way, don\u2019t apologize for being a Monday morning quarterback. Candidly, we deserve that and we\u2019re used to it over the last ferw weeks. I also want to preface my remarks by saying, I\u2019ve been in this role for less than 48 hours. And I want you to have high expectations for me, but actually I want to make sure that those are a bit tempered. When I think about the retail sales practices issues we\u2019ve had at the company, I wish that the business had escalated the issues sooner. I wish when the business escalated the issue that while the senior management team did a lot in response, I wish we could have done more. And I highlight that because I think that one of the lessons that I've learned \u2013 one of the lessons the entire company has learned and one of the reasons that we\u2019re organized the way we are today and we\u2019re making many of the changes that we\u2019ve talked about are that we've got to escalate issues wherever they occur within the company sooner. We\u2019ve got to deal with them sooner and we\u2019ve got to make sure that to the extent that they have any impact on our customers that we deal with that impact as quickly as we can. So it\u2019s about escalation and it's about speed and dealing with challenges and also dealing with opportunities as they come, Marty.", "Marty Mosby", "Do you feel that in that vein, being a high performer and being looked at as a high-quality bank for so long created some blinders, that maybe those blinders have now been taken off in your \u2013 like you're saying, reacting and moving quicker at this point?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yeah, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve created blinders. But, again, the fact of the matter is we should have escalated these issues sooner and we should have dealt with them more quickly than we did. So to the extent that some of our prior success impacted that, so be it. I can assure you that we\u2019ve talked about what you just described a lot. And we\u2019re going to make sure that that doesn't create a blinder now or in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Chris Kotowski", "Good morning. I never thought I'd ask you about this page of your press release again, but I'm looking at page 31 at the accretable yield, which usually wiggles and wobbles by $100 million or $200 million a quarter, and all of a sudden the expected cash flows are down by almost $5 billion. So can you say what happened there and does that \u2013 is that a headwind to net interest income going forward?", "Timothy Sloan", "I'm glad you asked. I wasn\u2019t sure whether anybody was going to get there. But the \u2013 so the accretable balance was down $4 billion in the quarter. It stands at about \u2013 I think \u2013 about $11.2 billion right now. So what\u2019s happened here is that prepayments have sped up. We\u2019ve reached a point where a lot of these borrowers have gotten themselves in the money for refis because of the path of HPI and we\u2019re experiencing and modeling faster cash flows as a result of that. And so, frankly, in the near term, I think we\u2019ll see an increased interest income as more of that comes through. But what it means is those loans won\u2019t be outstanding for as long as we might have previously predicted because they will be refi-ed.", "Chris Kotowski", "So that would be elevated accretion into net interest income than the next four \u2013 couple quarters, whatever, as you experience that?", "Timothy Sloan", "Correct.", "Chris Kotowski", "Okay. And then, headwind in future quarters after that. Okay. And the other thing I was wondering is how should we think about the impact of the settlement on op risk RWAs? Obviously, the financial impact is minor, but the impact on your company has been big in terms of management and press and reputation and so on. So how quickly does it all get factored in and any light you can shed on whatever the algorithm is?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yeah. So it\u2019s tough to say because the chapter \u2013 the middle chapters haven\u2019t been written of what the op risk outcome is. We know what the settlement was, but we\u2019ve got a variety of legal matters that we have to attend to, all of which will factor into a future view of what the total op risk experience is from it. So at the margin, it would be increasing. I think I mentioned earlier, in CCAR, our own stress analysis, we concoct and imagine outsized op risk outcomes to demonstrate that we\u2019ve got the capital and earnings power to overcome them and the magnitude of what we\u2019re talking about here frankly, \u2013 while it\u2019s significant, is modest in comparison to what you can imagine in stress, both in our own scenario as well as in CCAR. And, of course, what it means from the regulators perspective is they think about our op risk capacity in the future is up to them. But it will have an increase with the margin. It doesn't have a material increase in the moment because the numbers, as you say, have not been that big on the scale of Wells Fargo's balance sheet and earnings power so far. But it\u2019s a headwind and op risk. We\u2019ve been fortunate to have had modest op risk outcomes relative to the GSIB peer group over the CCAR era and this feels different because of the severity of the reputational harm that\u2019s been created.", "Chris Kotowski", "Okay. Alrighty. Thank you", "Chris Kotowski", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Hey Brian.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Great, thank you. Hi. Quick question just on \u2013 easy one first, on the long term debt, I know you said it went up based on the TLAC issuance, but didn't you also have debt that you put on related to the GE deals for pre-funding those deals that was puttable? Is that still on the balance sheet or did you put that back this quarter as well?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yeah, it\u2019s still on the balance sheet. So it is puttable and it's FHLB asset financing. So it shows up as longer-term debt. And you can see that on page 15, I think, of today's deck. So still in place. Now, of course, we\u2019re just using it as part of the general liability structure overall and will use it as long as we think that it is a good component of the stat.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Okay. Thanks. And then on the slide where you're monitoring the customer activity in the retail banking, you note that consumer checking account opens were down 25% year-on-year, credit card applications down 20% year-on-year. But if you start to annualize those numbers, they start to get very large, if you think about the credit card applications. That would be down on a full-year basis down 12% year-on-year relative to the total outstanding. So is there a way to quantify what that monthly impact was as it relates to revenue? I'm sure like not all applications actually get opened, but\u2026?", "John Shrewsberry", "The waterfall there is that applications may or may not become approvals and approvals may or may not become activated cards and activated cards have to become utilized and utilized cards become balances and balances accrue interest. So there\u2019s a lot of steps that have to be gone through before applications have an impact on either assets or revenue. One of the reasons for showing this is to help people understand what the immediate impact is and then to roll it forwards, so we can see whether annualizing that September number is really the right way to approach. September, obviously, was the first month. It\u2019s the month where we pulled back on marketing. It\u2019s the month when our team members were probably the most uncertain in terms of what the go forward model is going to be as we pivot toward service. It\u2019s the month when our customers and prospects are first reflecting their real dissatisfaction with Wells Fargo, all those things put together. And those are going to change in different ways as we roll it forward. So it\u2019s the installed base that drives the P&L results and that is where it is. And Tim mentioned that we\u2019re going to roll this forward probably during the quarter, so people can see whether October looks like September and November looks like October and then we can start to build a projectable impact on the trend. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "It is. Thanks.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Vivek, how are you this morning?", "Vivek Juneja", "Good. Good, Tim. Congratulations even though we would have all hoped it would have been under better circumstances.", "Timothy Sloan", "Me too.", "Vivek Juneja", "A question for both of you. You took a charge in the second quarter for CFPB several months which was announced September 8. Why no disclosure in the financial filings and are you planning to change anything as you think about that aspect as you look forward?", "John Shrewsberry", "So it\u2019s tricky one because we certainly account for these items when they become known or probable and estimable under GAAP. But, separately, we\u2019re also \u2013 these are also part of a confidential supervisory information that \u2013 there\u2019s a limitation of how much you can talk about while you\u2019re in the middle of a negotiation with the regulator. They can talk about whatever they choose to and they do sometimes and other times they wait until it ends. So we think about the circumstances in the moment. We, obviously, would love to be just close with and help people understand what's going on. We\u2019re certainly taking the charges when we need to take the charge. But we\u2019re not alone in that discussion. And usually, the circumstances are governed by \u2013 in the case of a regulator, the regulator. So that\u2019s how I think about that.", "Vivek Juneja", "So not even without giving us the amount, you couldn't even disclose a set of facts or the existence of those discussions?", "Timothy Sloan", "Vivek, the way that I would think about it is that this stems from the lawsuit that the City of LA filed a year before that. And so, there were issues that we were dealing with. But as John said, we\u2019ve got to be very careful and respectful of what we disclose in terms of conversations that we have with our regulators and that's really important, and the so short answer is we followed appropriate policies, procedures, rules and disclosure requirements.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. Separate question, sort of linked to all of this regulatory scrutiny that's going on, Tim. As a G-SIFI bank, scrutiny, obviously, with all of these happening, is going to increase for you. Does that have any bearing on how you think about the asset size as one metric? You're almost $1.95 trillion, the third largest bank. Citi reported a gap, gets companies to widen [indiscernible] growing even faster. Is that something that factors into how big is too big or what does it mean longer term?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yeah. It\u2019s a fair question. I think \u2013 we\u2019re focused less on size because size is ultimately determined by our customers. It\u2019s not necessarily determined by us. We want to arm our team members with the right incentives and have them work together and provide a good advice and service to our customers and make sure that we\u2019ve got great products out there. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive our size. Having said that, we need to make sure that as we think about our returns, so putting the [indiscernible] you might use, which we do all the time. Are we getting and providing the appropriate returns for our investors based upon our size? That's how we think about it.", "Having said that, we\u2019ve looked at across the company and you\u2019ve seen us exit some businesses that we believed would not provide us with as strong return as they might provide another owner. We sold our crop business. We sold our HSA business and so on. And because we appreciate in this environment and given the amount of liquidity and capital that we have that we\u2019ve got to be very mindful in terms of for how we deploy our assets.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Bush", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush", "Couple of questions, Tim. The first one, much has been made of the investigation that the board is independently conducting, the Shearman & Sterling investigation. I have not heard everything that's been said about that, whether the results of that will be made publicly known when it's over.", "Timothy Sloan", "A good question. I do not know the answer to that. The board will decide that.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. So there's no sort of regulatory imperative along with that? I'm assuming the regulators will have a look at that, but I'm just wondering if there's a transparency issue here that sort of needs to be overcome.", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, I wouldn\u2019t jump to a conclusion about whether it\u2019s a transparency issue or not. As you can see, we\u2019re trying to be more transparent in terms of the operations of the company than we\u2019ve ever been. But, Nancy, I want to be very respectful to the Board because that\u2019s the Board\u2019s decision.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. My second question would be this. Obviously, there are going to some near term issues here, not only retaining customers, but in attracting new ones. And I'm wondering if there is any thought being given to deposit pricing or fees, et cetera, as one of the levers to attract these clients?", "Timothy Sloan", "Nancy, all good ideas in this company are on the table. And we\u2019ve got an impressive management team whenever a company and it\u2019s the certainly case for us faced with these kinds of challenges. It\u2019s absolutely appropriate to step back and think about all aspects of how we provide product and service and convenience to our customers. And we certainly are thinking about price. Having said that, when you think about the driver of our company, one of the drivers for our company for decades is building that lifelong relationship that's not based on price. So could we make some changes in our pricing of certain products, deposit or otherwise? Sure, we could. But I would not expect us to lead with price.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. If I could just ask as an add-on to that. Obviously, your employees have really been put through the wringer through this whole process. Is there any thought about additional compensation or bonuses this year or something just as a way of saying, we're sorry?", "Timothy Sloan", "I think that saying that we put our team members through the wringer is an understatement. I really do. I really do. Especially team members on our retail banking platform. But it's throughout the company. We want to make sure that we retain the best people that we can. And we think we offer a very competitive set of compensation and benefits. We talked a little bit about that on one of the slides. But we appreciate that we\u2019ve got to recruit our team in this kind of environment and all ideas are on the table.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Barker", "Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on\u2026", "Timothy Sloan", "Hi, Kevin.", "Kevin Barker", "Hey, how are you doing? Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up in regards to your comments around the expenses and the efficiency ratio and you're saying it's going to be elevated. And you said it's going to be elevated or on the higher end of the 55% to 59% range into 2016. Are you now saying that that range is no longer valid and longer term \u2013 going into 2017, you might be above the efficiency ratio range or how should we think about that?", "Timothy Sloan", "You should think about it as an annual range. This quarter, we popped up above it, but still a good annual range. And if we start thinking that it\u2019s not, then we\u2019ll telegraph that to people. It\u2019s hard to be more specific. The operational or compliance-related issues are one set of cost that maybe can be modeled in the near term. But to the extent that we\u2019ve got lumpy operational losses that drive it up, those are just harder to predict and they\u2019ll happen when they happen. But if we think we\u2019re \u2013 the band is no longer the right band, then we\u2019ll tell you that.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay. And then when we think about the spend on marketing and compliance, are you expecting that to be offset by the potential to have branch closures or reductions in your branch costs in order to keep the expenses under control due to other areas or how should we think about the puts and takes around the expense number?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yeah. I wouldn't tie the two together. And I certainly wouldn't be focused on branch closures. What we\u2019ve talked about, and again I reflect back and how we described our branch platform at investor day, that we continue to update it all the time. We move branches around. We open new branches. We combine branches. We may close a few. I think this year, in fact, there\u2019s going to be a reduction unrelated to what we\u2019ve talked about here. But as John described, we\u2019ve got to look at our expenses and we have been looking at our expenses for some period of time to be able to keep the efficiency ratio within the range, even though it's at the upper end of the range because we need to invest not only in compliance, we\u2019ve got to invest in technology and bringing on new products and cyber defense and all of the above.", "John Shrewsberry", "Another thing, Kevin, is \u2013 as it relates \u2013 because other people have asked today with regard to that whatever might happen on the branch network side of things. That doesn't necessarily give you an immediate lift if you\u2019re thinking about today's elevated compliance cost or today\u2019s elevated marketing costs. If we\u2019re making moves on the physical distribution side of our business, that creates benefits in year two, year three, year four, but it\u2019s not really an immediate offset. So as Tim said, I wouldn\u2019t think about those as offsetting levers.", "Kevin Barker", "Okay. Do you think you can stay within your target if rates were to remain flat from where they are right now?", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, the way that range was constructed was with our expectation for rates, which is practically flat. But, for example, if we get a 25 basis point move in December, that wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable and that\u2019s essentially baked into being in that range. If we stay flat, we\u2019re not that far off of that. It\u2019s not that big. If we had a big move up in rates, which I think is highly unlikely, then that would probably move us down in the range. I think we\u2019ve said that before.", "Kevin Barker", "Yeah. Thank you very much.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning.", "Brennan Hawken", "Good morning. Sneaking in under the wire here. Just wanted to follow-up with \u2013 on Marty's question. Tim, the response seemed largely tactical. And so, I guess, as far as thinking about changes that your leadership might mean, does that mean that your view on the strategic approach versus prior leadership is largely unchanged? And it's certainly true you haven't been in the seat very long, but the idea that you would be taking over is certainly something that wasn't out of the blue. So I'm sure you had some ideas coming in here?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, I have lots of ideas, but candidly I'd be a lot more nervous if I were you if I came out with some new strategic plan for Wells Fargo in 48 hours. That would be pretty dangerous from my perspective. But, look, the company \u2013 when I think about the company that I joined 29 years ago, it\u2019s so different today. My guess is Wells Fargo is going to be different five years from now, 10 years from now and 15 years now. And you know what, I hope it is, because by changing and adapting to the environment we are in, that\u2019s one of the reasons why we've had a history of success, notwithstanding the last month or so. The last month or so has been a real challenge as we\u2019ve talked about on the call today and I am sure we\u2019ll continue to talk about for a while. But we've made some important announcements this week. Again, you might call them tactical. I think they're actually in the strategic bend. The creation of a new business line, the elevation of some new senior leaders in our wholesale banking and our community banking business as well as consumer lending. They\u2019re going to bring some new ideas. So, no, fair point that it\u2019s probably a little bit more tactical and strategic, but over time you'll see some updates and we'll talk about those over the next few months and I'm sure we'll talk about some of that at Investor day next year.", "Brennan Hawken", "Sure. And actually, the spirit of my question was actually in response to Marty's question. I think you had talked about making adjustments to the escalation methods on the back, right? So that was more the reference of tactical rather than the management changes that you\u2019ve made. Okay. Sorry, Time, go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "No, no. I appreciate it. Fair question. So a different direction here, for the second question. One of your wire house competitors did come out and confirm the recent stories on their policies for dealing with the DOL rule. Have you finalized your policies and can you tell us any details about those?", "John Shrewsberry", "So we\u2019re \u2013 this is John.", "John Shrewsberry", "We\u2019re still in the process of refining the overall implementation approach to be compliant with the rules. I think we\u2019re still going to approach every client relationship with an emphasis on every client having a customized plan that guides their investment activity. We\u2019re going to emphasize advisory solutions and continue to offer traditional brokerage for certain clients that include self-directed options. And we\u2019ll be sharing more details as we get closer to implementation. I think with each ensuing quarter between now and later in 17, you should expect to hear a little bit more about the specifics of the implementation. But we haven't reached the same conclusion in the same timeframe as the comparator that I think you're referring to.", "Brennan Hawken", "Thanks for the call.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thank you.", "I know it's been a busy morning for everybody and our call has been a little bit longer than normal. But I really want to thank all of you for your thoughtful questions, the discussion I think has been incredibly helpful for both John and me and we look forward to continuing to provide additional disclosure to you as we move through the quarter. And we thank you for your interest in Wells Fargo.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].", "I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin.", "Jim Rowe", "Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn our call over to CEO and President, Tim Sloan.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The benefit of our diversified business model once again resulted in strong financial performance. Our team members are committed to putting our customers first and helping them succeed financially, which is demonstrated each and every day all across our Company. Here are just a few examples. We continued to improve customer experience and loyalty scores in Retail Banking. Our debit card purchase and transaction volumes were industry leading. We had record client assets in Wealth and Investment Management, and we originate more ACH payments than any other financial institution.", "Let me briefly summarize our financial results in the second quarter. We generated earnings of $5.8 billion, up 5% from a year-ago and EPS of $1.07 a share, up 6%. We produced $22.2 billion of revenue with record net interest income, up 6% from a year-ago. Average earning assets grew 5% from a year-ago, average deposits were a record $1.3 trillion, up 5% from a year-ago. We had very strong credit results with the net charge-off rate declining to 27 basis points, the lowest level I\u2019ve seen during my nearly 30 years at Wells Fargo reflecting our consistent risk management.", "Our efficiency ratio was 61.1% in the second quarter. While it improved from the first quarter, the efficiency ratio is still too high, operating at this level is just not acceptable and we are firmly committed to the goals we provided at Investor Day. As John will discuss later on the call, we are making progress on our ongoing expense initiatives which target $2 billion of expense saves by the end of 2018 that will support our investment in the business and an additional $2 billion of expense saves by the end of 2019 that is expected to go to the bottom line.", "And while we are focused on reducing expenses and improving efficiency, we are continuing to invest in our businesses and in particular technologies that make it easier for our commercial and consumer customers to manage their finances. During the second quarter, we rolled out Zelle, a P2P payment platform for 28 million digital customers, provided enhancements for our Treasury Management customers to streamline and automate accounts receivable, launched a chatbot pilot for Facebook Messenger, began the rollout of new streamlined mobile checking account opening experiences for our customers, and launched a new service for commercial card customers that allows them to upload and manage receipts with their mobile device.", "At the end of the first quarter, we were the first large bank in the U.S. to offer card-free access to all of our ATMs and our customers are excited about this added convenience. As of last week, our customers had used the new card-free ATM access code over 1 million times. We are also focused on improving the operating performance of the Company by increasing our emphasis on core banking products and services that we believe are most relevant for our customers and provide the best financial returns for our shareholders.", "As part of this effort, last year we sold our crop insurance and health benefit services businesses and we recently announced the sale of our commercial insurance business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter and our shareowner service business, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2018.", "Importantly, during the second quarter, we continued to make progress on rebuilding trust, which remains our top priority. Let me update you on a few actions and milestones. This week, we received preliminary court approval for the $142 million settlement agreement for a class action lawsuit concerning retail sales practices, including providing an avenue for customers whose credit was harmed to seek compensation.", "We expect the settlement to resolve substantially all claims in 10 other pending class actions. Over the past 10 months, we've been very comprehensive in our approach to customer outreach and remediation, and these efforts are ongoing. This preliminary approval, which covers the period beginning in May of 2002 through April of 2017, is a significant step forward in our efforts to make things right for our customers.", "Our team members completed a company-wide, third-party culture assessment in the second quarter, which provided them the opportunity to share feedback about Wells Fargo\u2019s culture. We are processing these results and the goal is to identify both positive attributes and potential weaknesses, so we can take actions that will strengthen our culture.", "We launched our new nationwide marketing campaign, building better every day, which builds on our commitment to creating a better bank for our customers, our team members, communities, and investors. We still have more work to do, including the completion of a third-party review of our sales practices in the Community Bank as part of meeting our consent order obligations as well as a voluntary review of accounts from 2009 and 2010 to determine possible unauthorized accounts and associated harm, which we expect to complete by the end of the third quarter.", "However, I'm pleased with the progress we've made, and I'm confident we're on the right path. Our recent CCAR results are just one indication of that. As part of our 2017 capital plan, we expect to return more capital to our shareholders, including increasing the third quarter common stock dividend to $0.39 per share, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. The plan also includes up to $11.5 billion of common stock repurchases on a gross basis during the four quarter period starting in the third quarter of this year. This is an increase from the $8.3 billion we repurchased during the four-quarter period ended June 30.", "Before I turn the call over to John to discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to again highlight the efforts of our 271,000 team members who work hard each and every day to fulfill our vision of helping our customers to succeed financially, which results in such strong operating performance for our shareholders. John?", "John Shrewsberry", "Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As Tim mentioned, we earned $5.8 billion in the second quarter, the 19th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. We believe this outcome reflects the benefit of our diversified business model during a period of continued modest economic growth and uncertainty regarding future interest rates.", "Tim described most of the year-over-year results that we show on Page 3. So I'll just highlight the decline of 82 million common shares outstanding over the past year, reflecting our strong capital return through a net share repurchases.", "Turning to Page 4, let me highlight a few notable balance sheet trends. Driven primarily by the expected decline in auto loans, which were down $2.5 billion from the first quarter, total loans declined $982 million from the prior quarter. As we've discussed previously, we've tightened credit underwriting standards in auto, which was reduced our origination volume down 17% from the first quarter.", "Cash and short-term investments declined $43.5 billion, reflecting a seasonal decline in deposits and the pay-down of wholesale funding. However, we still maintain strong liquidity levels and could deploy tens of billions of dollars and remain LCR compliant.", "Investment securities increased $2 million in the quarter, we had approximately $37 billion of gross purchases in the quarter, the majority of which were agency MBS. These purchases were largely offset by run-off in the sale of approximately $15 billion of lower yielding short duration securities. The $17.6 billion decrease in long-term debt was primarily driven by the prepayment of Federal Home Loan Bank advances.", "Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5, I'll describe revenue and expense trends later on the call. So let me just highlight that our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 27.7%. This included discrete tax benefits totaling $186 million or approximately $0.04 per share, primarily as a result of our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance Services. We currently expect our full-year 2017 effective income tax rate to be approximately 29%.", "As shown on Page 6, the benefit from higher rates increased average loan yields 10 basis points in the quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of increasing loan yields. We had modest average loan growth from a year-ago, up 1% and average loans declined $6.7 billion from the first quarter. H.8 data continue to indicate that there was softness across the industry, but they're also specific actions we've taken, primarily driven by our own risk discipline, which have caused our growth to slow.", "Let me explain the primary factors impacting our loan portfolios in some more detail. Starting with commercial C&I loans increased $1.9 billion from the first quarter. We had growth across a number of businesses, including $1.1 billion in Government and Institutional Banking, $605 million in Wells Fargo Commercial Capital, $469 million in Global Banking and modest growth in the middle market. The growth was partially offset by $620 million decline in financial institutions from actions we've taken to lower exposure in certain emerging markets and decreased demand.", "Capital markets activity has resulted in pay-downs in Corporate Banking. It's interesting to note that Wells Fargo Securities was involved in some capacity in all of the capital markets activity associated with the pay-downs of these loans in Corporate Banking, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model. The size of our oil and gas portfolio stabilized and we had $12.7 billion outstanding at the end of the second quarter.", "Commercial real estate loans declined $982 million from the first quarter and while we remain the largest CRE lender in the country, our growth has been modestly below that of the industry for the first half of this year. We've remained disciplined and in hearing to our underwriting standards in a competitive market.", "We summarize our consumer loan portfolios on Page 8. This portfolio declined $11.1 billion from a year-ago, primarily due to $7 billion of lower junior lien mortgage loans at $4 billion of lower auto loans. Let me explain the $1.9 billion linked quarter decline in consumer loan portfolio in some more detail.", "Our first mortgage loans increased $1.9 billion from the first quarter, reflecting $7.3 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans, partially offset by the continued run-off of higher yielding legacy portfolios, including the sale of $569 million Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio.", "Our junior lien mortgage loan portfolio continued to decline as expected as pay-downs more than offset new originations. Our credit card portfolio increased $563 million from the first quarter reflecting seasonality. Our auto portfolio continued to decline as expected and was down $2.5 billion from the first quarter.", "As a result of tightening underwriting standards, the quality of originations has improved with the quarterly average FICO of 719 at origination in the second quarter, up from 696 a year-ago. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we're also making a number of organizational changes in this business including a new leader. As we focus on improving execution and efficiency through increased standardization and centralization. We expect auto loans to continue to decline in the second half of this year.", "Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $339 million reflecting seasonality in our student loan portfolio and $190 million decline in personal loans and lines. While consumer loan growth will continue to be impacted by the actions we're taking in our auto portfolio and the expected run-off of legacy junior lien mortgage loans, we are making some modest changes to generate new loan originations, including offering interest-only jumbo mortgage loans to high quality borrowers and testing credit card offerings through our digital channels.", "As highlighted on Page 9, the average deposits were a record $1.3 trillion, up $64.5 billion or 5% from a year-ago and up $2 billion from the first quarter. Our deposit betas remain low with our average deposit cost up four basis points from the first quarter. While we've implemented some incremental commercial deposit repricing in line with the market was not made material changes in rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits as we've seen very little market response in these categories. With the majority of our peers holding rates steady. We continue to monitor the overall market and we expect deposit betas will be more responsive as we move further into the rate cycle.", "Net interest income was a record $12.5 billion in the second quarter, up 6% from a year-ago and 1% from the first quarter. The increase from the first quarter reflected the benefit of the repricing of earning assets due to higher short-term interest rates, which exceeded the associated cost of repricing liabilities. We also benefited from one additional day in the quarter.", "The net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 2.9% driven by higher short-term interest rates, disciplined deposit pricing and a reduction in long-term debt, which were partially offset by the impacts from lower loan and investment securities balances.", "As we've previously stated, we expect NII to grow in the low to mid single digits for the full-year 2017. The rate of growth during the second half of the year will be dependent on a variety of factors including the level and slope of the yield curve as well as deposit betas and earning asset growth trends.", "Non-interest income declined $743 million from a year-ago, driven by lower market sensitive and mortgage banking revenue, while non-interest income was down only $16 million from the first quarter. There are few business drivers, I want to highlight. Deposit service charges were down $37 million from the first quarter, reflecting a higher earnings credit rate for commercial customers and lower consumer and business checking service charges.", "Over the past few months, we've made a number of changes to help our customers avoid unexpected overdrafts including the introduction of a zero balance email alert that sent intraday when a customer\u2019s available balance is zero or negative, which our online banking customers receive automatically.", "Card fees were a record $1 billion, up $74 million from the first quarter, reflecting a 7% increase in debit card transaction volume and the 12% increase in credit card purchase volume.", "Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $80 million from the first quarter, residential mortgage origination volume increased $12 billion or 27% from the first quarter on higher purchase volume, reflecting seasonality and a strong purchase market. However, originations were down 11% from a year-ago, reflecting lower refi volume. According to NBA data, the industry is projected to decline 15% for full-year 2017 from the slowdown in refinancing.", "Applications were up 41% from the first quarter and we ended the second quarter with a $34 billion unclosed pipeline. The production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 124 basis points in the second quarter, down from 168 basis points in the first quarter. Approximately two-thirds of the decline was due to competitive pricing in both the retail and correspondent channels, while the rest of the decline was driven by a mix shift to a higher percentage of correspondent channel originations, which have a significantly lower margin than retail originations.", "55% of our originations in the second quarter were correspondent, up from 50% in the first quarter and 44% a year-ago. While it's still very early in the quarter, we currently expect similar industry pricing and mix trends. Finally, our other income increased $249 million from the first quarter and included a $309 million gain on the sale of a Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio.", "On Page 12, we provide details on trading related revenue and the impact to net interest income and non-interest income. Trading-related revenue was down $151 million or 15% from the first quarter. Trading-related net interest income increased $51 million. However, non-interest income declined $202 million from the first quarter on lower net gains from trading activities.", "$81 million of the decline was from lower deferred compensation plan investment results, which was largely offset in employee benefits expense. The decline also reflected lower market making trading results losses from RMBS and equity-related activity, which was offset in interest income and lower CVA and DVA.", "As shown on Page 13, expenses declined to $251 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by the seasonal decline in compensation related expense. As Tim mentioned earlier, while our efficiency ratio improved to 61.1% in the second quarter, it's still too high.", "We currently expect our efficiency ratio to improve in the second half of the year and expect our full-year efficiency ratio to be 60% to 61% in 2017. This estimate does not include any potential non-recurring expenses including reasonably possible, but not yet accrued litigation expenses.", "At Investor Day, we helped \u2013 to help analyze our expenses; we divided our non-interest expense line items into six main expense categories. We've used these same categories to describe the expense drivers on a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis starting on Page 15. The 2% decline in expenses from the first quarter was driven by $570 million decline in compensation and benefits expense from seasonally lower, personnel expenses and lower deferred comp expense.", "We also had $52 million reduction in infrastructure expense on lower equipment expense from typically high first quarter software licensing and maintenance costs. Partially offsetting these declines was $266 million of higher thirty-party services expense. This increase reflected higher spending primarily related to Technology, Consent Orders, Resolution, Recovery Planning and Legal Expenses. We currently expect these costs to remain at an elevated level in the third quarter before declining in the fourth quarter.", "We also had higher non-discretionary running the business expenses. This increase was primarily from $68 million of higher operating losses in the second quarter driven by higher litigation accruals.", "As we usually do, we will include in our 10-Q filing an update on the high-end of the range of reasonably possible \u2013 potential litigation losses in excess of our accrued liability for the quarter. But based on the information currently available, which may change between now and when we file the 10-Q, we expect the high end of the range to increase by approximately $1.3 billion due to a variety of matters, including our existing RMBS related regulatory investigations.", "On Page 16, we show the drivers of the year-over-year increases in expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $339 million, driven by higher salaries from annual salary increases and a 1% increase in FTE. Thirty-party services expense also increased $339 million approximately $110 million of this increase was sales practice related. Non-discretionary running the business expense increased $185 million, which included $94 million donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation and $73 million amount of higher FDIC expense due to the special assessment implemented last July.", "Partially offsetting these increases were $152 million of lower revenue related expenses primarily from lower commissions and other incentives in Mortgage and Wholesale Banking. Discretionary running the business expense declined $60 million on lower travel and entertainment, postage, and advertising expense. We continue to make progress on efficiency initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year-end 2018 with the full-year benefit starting in 2019.", "As we've previously mentioned these savings will be reinvested in the business, however, there are timing differences to consider. We've significantly increased our business investments in the last few years, and while we've made a lot of progress on the work that needs to be done on these initiatives. Most of the expenses savings are in the earlier stages are being realized.", "As we show on Page 17, the largest opportunity relates to centralization and optimization, we list the lot of great examples of the efforts we're making, which we expect will save $1.3 billion annually. Let me highlight just a few. Approximately 113,000 team members across the Company have been realigned over the past 18 months as part of our centralization and optimization initiative. Operating cost in human resources have already been reduced by 12% since the beginning of 2016 and we reduced the number of marketing agency vendors resulting in 12% reduction in quarterly agency fees from a year-ago also.", "On Slide 18, we highlight the other areas of the $2 billion expense initiative, through aggregating demand and staffing to create certain capabilities in-house we expect to save approximately $200 million related to third-party services expense. During the first six months of this year, we\u2019ve closed 93 branches, including 54 in the second quarter and we're on track to close 200 branches this year. As we disclosed at Investor Day, we plan to close in additional 250 branches next year.", "As a reminder, there are minimal immediate savings recognized from branch closures due to the initial closing costs. So therefore most of the expense benefit from the 200 branches we close this year will not be realized until next year. We also expect to save approximately $150 million and infrastructure expense through continued site consolidation outside of our branch network and we're on track to reduce two million square feet this year.", "We expect to save another $200 million through other initiatives, including reduced to travel expenses. As we discussed at Investor Day, we expect an additional $2 billion in annual expenses saves by the end of 2019 these savings are projected to go to the bottom line.", "Turning to our Business segments starting on Page 19, Community Banking earned $3 billion in the second quarter, down 6% from a year-ago and down 1% from the first quarter. Our branch network is now below 6,000 for the first time since our merger with Wachovia at the end of 2008. As we discussed at Investor Day, we're making a shift in how we report activity to highlight metrics we believe best show how we're managing the business today and our most important to our long-term success.", "As we show on Slide 20, existing customers continue to actively use their accounts, branch and ATM interactions were up 3% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality and we're down 3% from a year-ago. The decline from a year-ago was primarily driven by customers migrating to our digital channels with digital secure sessions up 5% from a year-ago.", "Our 27.9 million digital active customers are increasingly using our award winning online and mobile capabilities. For the first time in May, we had more mobile active customers than online active customers and we continue to invest in our mobile capabilities, including as Tim highlighted at the top, the ability to open accounts through mobile. Primary consumer checking customers increased from a year-ago, although the rate of growth has continued to slow active consumer general purpose credit card accounts were up 2% from both the first quarter from a year-ago.", "On Slide 21, we highlight balance and activity growth, which drives revenue. Average consumer and small business banking deposits grew by 5% from a year-ago. Debit card purchase volume increased 6% and the average consumer general purpose credit card balances increased 7% from a year-ago.", "Our team members continue to focus on what we know is most important providing outstanding customer service. This effort has resulted in the overall satisfaction with most recent visit and customer loyalty scores in June reaching their highest levels since August of 2016 and overall satisfaction scores were higher than a year-ago.", "The Community Banking team continues to work on making changes that will further improve the customer and team member experience. We're investing in training leaders throughout the country during coaching events that started last month. During the second quarter, we had our first payout under the new compensation plan for Community Banking team members with a 90% participation rate. More changes to the way we do business will be rolled out during the third quarter to further support our priorities through simplification, collaboration and innovation.", "Wholesale Banking earned $2.4 billion in the second quarter, up 15% from a year-ago and up 13% from the first quarter. These results included a tax benefit resulting from our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance Services. It's also important to note that prior year results included the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business.", "Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $682 million in the second quarter, up 17% from a year-ago and up 9% from the first quarter. WIM had positive operating leverage on both year-over-year and linked-quarter basis, revenue increased 7% from a year-ago with a 21% increase in net interest income and a 2% growth in non-interest income. Average loans grew 7% and average deposits increased 3%.", "Deposit growth was impacted by seasonal tax related outflows, as well as brokerage clients moving more of their cash balances into other investments. We highlighted last quarter then in March; we had our first $1 billion month of closed referred investment assets from the partnership between Wealth and Investment Management and Community Banking since the sales practices settlement.", "Twice during the second quarter, we achieved $1 billion of monthly closed referred investment assets, a result of effective partnering between our bankers and financial advisors. WIM total client assets were a record $1.8 trillion, up 8% from a year-ago, driven by continued positive net flows and higher market valuations.", "Turning to Page 24, net charge-offs decreased $150 million from the first quarter with 27 basis points of annualized net charge-offs, which are at historically low levels. Commercial losses declined $68 million from the first quarter, driven by continued improvement in our oil and gas portfolio, where losses declined $81 million linked-quarter.", "Consumer losses declined $82 million with lower losses in auto, consumer real estate and other revolving credit and installment portfolios. Our consumer real estate portfolios both first and second lien mortgages were actually in a net recovery position in the second quarter, demonstrating the significant improvement in the residential real estate market and the quality of loans we put on our balance sheet.", "Non-performing assets continued to decline, down $827 million from the first quarter with improvements across all commercial portfolios and consumer real estate portfolios as well as lower foreclosed assets. We had a reserve release of $100 million, reflecting continued strong credit performance.", "Turning to Page 25, our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in increased to 11.6% in the second quarter and we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. Our net payout ratio was 63%. As Tim mentioned as part of our 2017 capital plan, we expect to return more capital to shareholders over the next four quarters, including up to $11.5 billion of gross common stock repurchases.", "Based on our updated TLAC estimate as of the end of the second quarter, we've exceeded our expected minimum requirement of 22% largely from lower RWAs and continued debt issuance. However, we continue to issue eligible TLAC to fund maturities, fund RWA growth and the expected migration of our CET1 level to our internal target level over time.", "In summary, our results in the second quarter, which included 1.21% return on assets and 11.95% return on equity and 14.26% return on tangible common equity demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model which is generated, as I said earlier over $5 billion in quarterly earnings every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2012.", "We shared updates throughout the call today on progress we've made toward our goal of being the financial services leader in six areas; customer service and advice, team member engagement, innovation, risk management, corporate citizenship, and long-term shareholder value. I'm optimistic that the progress we are making will continue to drive our long-term success.", "And I think we will now take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, good morning.", "John Shrewsberry", "Good morning, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck", "I wanted to just kick-off on loan growth because while it was decent number relative to what we're seeing in the industry, the H8 was a little slower than what we're looking forward. So could you just give us a sense as to how you think that's going to be trajecting on a core level? And then was there anything on a non-core roll-off that was impacting the number?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, I think \u2013 Betsy that's one of the reasons why we wanted to provide some additional granularity in the slides in terms of where we're seeing loan growth. I think the loan growth trends continue to be good with the headwind that we're having just in terms of the absolute number being the run-off of the junior lien mortgage portfolio and then the impact from auto. But you saw in the first quarter or in the second quarter that we had some good growth in the C&I book, in Government and Institutional Banking, in Commercial Capital and Global Banking.", "Within the C&I book while real estate \u2013 commercial real estate construction activity was up, the more typical commercial real estate loans were down a little bit, primarily due to some of the competitive pressures that we're seeing out there. But I think our trends should continue and that is \u2013 our goal is to grow above the industry average.", "I think the important thing here and one of the reasons why we wanted to be really transparent is that we've got to do this. And one of the reasons why we've become the largest lender in the country is because of our consistent approach to how we manage risk. And we've seen cycles before; we'll see them again, but we will continue to be optimistic because loans are such an important product for our customers.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And then just separately to follow-up Tim on the decision to sell the insurance brokerage and then there was a small separate sale of a business, I think it was the shareholder services business that hit the tape the other day. I just wonder if you could give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the businesses that you want to retain, attract, invest in versus the ones that you are deciding to move away from because frankly, in conversations with investors, the insurance -- that was a bit of a surprise to people, thought was that it was good for CCAR and ROE, albeit had a higher expense ratio. So with that as a backdrop, maybe if you can give us your sense as to what we should be expecting from the team going forward?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, I think what you should expect from our team is continued strong performance, which is what we've delivered this quarter. I think in terms of businesses to that we've decided to sell, we\u2019re continuing to look at all of our businesses.", "We have high expectations in terms of financial performance, and for those businesses that one, we don't believe are as core for the platform, but two, maybe can grow better in the hands of others, we\u2019ve decided to exit those. I think the crop insurance business is a great example of that. It was actually bought by one of our customers and my understanding is they\u2019re doing well, which is great. We\u2019re happy about that.", "Likewise, the health benefit services business, which was a good business for us. The challenge there candidly was that the regulatory environment for that business got much more in terms of \u2013 became much more focused on medical regulations and we just thought that that was going to be a better chance to grow in the hands of somebody that's in that business full time; and again, we sold that to one of our customers. That's gone pretty well.", "And then likewise, on the insurance business, recall a couple \u2013 or three years ago, we sold the non-footprint offices in our commercial insurance brokerage business because there just wasn't much connection there with our existing business and as we looked at the insurance business, again it was performing fine, but candidly I think that that it might \u2013 we thought it might work better with others and we're very pleased with the buyer USI. They were the same firm that purchase the offices that we sold in 2014 and then again with shareowner services.", "So we're going to continue to look at all of our businesses. Those were all good businesses. I think other thing that is important is that all those buyers took care of our team. So we're trying to improve our results to all of you, and we're going to continue to look hard at our businesses and if something doesn't fit, then we'll move on.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Hey Matt.", "Matt O'Connor", "Good morning. So a lot of good details on the expenses, the drivers of \u2013 with the $2 billion net will come from I think it's all very helpful and at the back half of the year commentary I think it\u2019s positive. But are you able to give some visibility on where you think the absolute level of cost can be looking on a couple of years?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, for the reasons we've talked about before, it's tough to give an absolute number, because so much of our expense is driven by the business results that are happening in any given quarter because they are related to production levels, et cetera. So instead what we are focused on is what we're taking out and focus importantly on our 55% to 59% efficiency ratio because we're driving our businesses to outperform and incidentally that is part of the story that you mentioned in your question.", "But the things we're focusing on our lower efficiency ratio businesses and the things that probably don't fit as well as some of our higher efficiency ratio businesses not all. So I would think of it that way. What costs are we taking out because there is non-value added, and we're improving the Company and where we signaling that we're going to run the Company over time, 55% to 59% as opposed to a specific dollar, which reflects more assumptions and it's reasonable to make about what our business mix is at that time what our production levels are at that time.", "Matt O'Connor", "Yes, I can appreciate, some moving pieces in the revenue side, I do think even a range might be helpful. Some of your competitors, Bank of America and JPMorgan, one would argue they've got more volatile revenue stream and you because of a bigger investment bank and JPMorgan gives us an annual expense target, Bank of America is a number out there, couple years out. So I think it's something we're considering. I think would be helpful for your stock, obviously the expense message overall is positive and I do think it's something that might be helpful?", "Timothy Sloan", "Thank you.", "Matt O'Connor", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "John McDonald", "Hi, following up on Matt's question on the expenses. John, can we go over that concept of the timing differences between the first $2 billion of expense saves that you're targeting for the end of 2018 and kind of the offsetting spending some of which is already occurring. Could you just explain that timing difference again? So we understand it.", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. So the first $2 billion should be fully in the run rate at the end of 2018, and the second $2 billion should be fully in the run rate at the end of 2019. The concept of the timing difference is, we have elevated expense today and we described some of the areas where that's occurring, some of that will abate naturally because programs run-off between now and the end of 2018 or at the end of 2019. So there isn't a nice stair-step that describes what rolls on and what rolls off. But we have higher expenses and this should be today in certain areas, and we've got these programs kicking in when we're describing them kicking in.", "Now it's certainly possible that \u2013 it's very likely actually that will begin to drip into the run rate, the first $2 billion before the end of 2018 and the second $2 billion before the end of 2019 that the last dollar of it should be in the run rate by the end of 2018 and the end of 2019. And then the complicated, I know you know this, but we've got a few other items that will be rolling off after 2018, FDIC insurance that sort of super premium there and some amortization of deposit intangibles that\u2019s out there.", "We are also selling these businesses, which will have an impact on expenses. All of those things will be happening at about the same time, but we'll keep driving people back towards evidence of the $2 billion for 2018 and the $2 billion of 2019, so you can see where we're taking that cost out.", "John McDonald", "And because of that difference between the spending that you're doing to offset the first $2 billion and when you get the sales by next year, won't effectively some of that first $2 billion really be falling to the bottom line again 2018 because if the spending already happened, but now you are getting the savings?", "John Shrewsberry", "Some of it will. That's because it's coming in before the last day of 2018 and there will be some ramp down in certain of the programs that we've got that have elevated expense today. But just for clarity sake to help people to understand how long it might take, we're describing it as the end of 2018 and the end of 2019.", "John McDonald", "And then to the question of longer term targets, understanding the challenge of an absolute dollar target, but maybe a target that's the gap between your revenue growth and expense growth over time? Is that something that you might aspire to having a gap between those two and operating leverage kind of target?", "John Shrewsberry", "We certainly aspire to have consistent positive operating leverage. It depends on what's going on with the rates, well all that's happening because the business mix will make a big difference and what kind of leverage we get with so much leverage in a higher rate environment if there isn\u2019t a lower rate environment, because you get extra revenue without actually having to put more labor into it. So there are assumptions that are embedded and what that would look like, but just to be perfectly clear in every business, in every way we're targeting to end up in a consistent positive operating leverage environment as a result of the moves that we're making.", "John McDonald", "Okay, that's fair. One quick follow-up. Is there any change in your loan growth outlook for the full-year? I think in Investor Day, you're kind of targeting low single-digit loan growth for the year in terms of low single-digits, any change there after the results this quarter?", "John Shrewsberry", "I think we're still looking at that same target.", "John McDonald", "For the year? Okay.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, for the year.", "John McDonald", "Okay, thanks.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Hey Ken.", "Ken Usdin", "Hey thanks. Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. One more specific on just the expense trajectory. Can you help us understand on the insurance brokerage side and the sales of those businesses, is there any way to help us understand the magnitude of the revenue and expense related to those that go away. And are those expenses, specifically in the $2 billion?", "Timothy Sloan", "So two things, one because we're still in the process of closing on those transactions, it\u2019s not appropriate to talk too much about the results of the businesses, we will wait until that's done. But two things, one is both the businesses that have been announced and are being closed this year have very high efficiency ratios. So you would expect to see the efficiency ratio benefit at the margin. These aren't huge businesses, but at the margin from the outcome and we'll talk more about what they meant to Wells Fargo after they close. But no, they're not in the $2 billion. So specifically the list of things that we're doing to improve Wells Fargo isn't getting benefited by expenses going away from having sold the business.", "Ken Usdin", "That\u2019s great. Thanks for that. Second thing, just on \u2013 as the loan mix \u2013 well as the earning asset mix is changed with slower loan growth and mixing a little bit more into securities and cash. Can you just help us through the dynamic of just net interest income and NIM trajectory from here? Thanks.", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes, well, so there's a lot that's going to happen with NIM trajectory and I'd say the biggest drivers to look for \u2013 part of it is earning asset mix and the rate of growth in loans and of course what kind of loans we put on the books. But at least in the short to medium-term probably more impactful is what's going on with deposit pricing, because we have been outperforming the beta that we showed to you at our Investor Day by a reasonable amount, especially on the consumer and small business side of things.", "And so as we sit around and think about the next six to 12 months and what happens with rates and what happens with net interest income whether or not we continue to outperform our modeled expectations on deposit repricing is really one of the big drivers, obviously deposit growth, loan growth, deployment into securities all matter, but I would focus on deposit pricing in the near-term.", "Ken Usdin", "But you feel confident that NII can continue to grow from here?", "John Shrewsberry", "We do. In fact, I think I mentioned sort of confirming that low-to-mid single digits NII \u2013 annual NII growth 2017 versus\u2026", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, understood. Thanks John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Erika Najarian", "Hi, good morning.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning, Erika.", "Erika Najarian", "I wanted to focus my line of questioning in terms of the revenue progress that\u2019s underlying your goal to get back to your efficiency range and maybe it's good to just jump off from Ken\u2019s line of questioning, you mentioned the betas are going to be a big swing factor, and I'm wondering how you're thinking about the sensitivity of outflow in beta as the Fed begins to reduce their balance sheet and how it would impact you specifically?", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. I mean I think our general assessment is if they start selling long duration assets, I know that there are people who believe that depositors will rush out of bank deposits and rush into mortgages in 10 years. I\u2019m less confident that that is an expected behavior, but let's assume that deposits decreased by some percentage of the amount of shrinkage in the balance sheet.", "I don\u2019t think we have any reason to believe that our impact on that would be any greater than our percentage of deposits overall, because we think that we're very competitive in our deposit franchises. We certainly are on product; service et cetera and we could be as competitive in prices as we choose to be depending on what the impact is on our business at that time.", "So the way we're thinking about it is we'll all wait and see what the impact \u2013 what happens to deposits in the aggregate. And then we'll react from a defensive position to the extent necessary to protect our deposit franchise as when and if the market begins to make moves in order to stem whatever tide of outflows there are at deposit side of the system.", "Timothy Sloan", "Erika, just to reinforce John\u2019s point, I think that's why it\u2019s really important from our perspective to make sure that we're investing in our products and services convenience as John mentioned for our consumer customers that is \u2013 that when you are in an environment where it is uncertain, I mean the Fed has never had a balance sheet of this size. We've never been through a situation where they're talking about reducing a balance sheet.", "We can talk about history all day long, but since we've never been through that, nobody knows exactly what's going to happen. But what we do know is one thing and that is our customers\u2019 value convenience, service, reliability. And to the extent that we can continue to invest in all of our products and services we can compete on much more than just price. And as John said, we're comfortable about our ability in any environment of maintaining and hopefully growing our deposits here.", "Erika Najarian", "Thank you. Moving on just to the other side of the balance sheet, one of your competitors gave a dollar number in terms of how much liquidity had been tied up with their Living Will process. And I'm wondering, especially given the treasury proposal, if you could share at least ballpark, how much liquidity is tied up there and just I guess wondering what the opportunity set for Wells Fargo could be, if reform does come to task given it seems like liquidity versus capital, it seems much more of the constraint?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. There are big liquidity requirements as a result of resolution planning, but frankly, I don't think they get us to much different of a number than our LCR process. In fact LCR might actually take us to the requirements, plus our buffer we take us to a higher level than our resolution liquidity needs in our plan. So yes, there's a lot of liquidity on the books of the biggest banks. But it's for both of those reasons, and so if \u2013 in some way resolution planning was softened somehow. Frankly, I don't think for us, it would make that big of a difference, and I\u2019ll leave with that.", "Erika Najarian", "And the final question just on the fee side, if you take out the gain on the PCI loans, the run rate is something like $9.4 billion and as we're looking forward to efficiency improvement for the second half of the year from the 61%. I'm wondering how we should think about the progression of fees in the second half.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, well, I mean I go line by line. Probably the biggest swing item of course will be mortgage and what happens because now there is more price competition I think reflecting excess capacity and reflecting the different market that we're in. It's a little bit more of a free for all in the purchase market than it is in a refi market because of the way people source their mortgage loans and one versus the other.", "Then I\u2019ll just go back to their service or they go out to the market in a purchase environment. So I think mortgage banking could be a little bit more volatile. I think volumes are good and our leading shares certainly help and our introduction of technology, there will be an incremental help, but that's a reasonable swing item.", "I think everything else right now is in line with our five-quarter averages. We had a record in card fees for the quarter. Trust and investment fees are very high with the WIM results and that reflects inflows, as well as the levels of asset prices that drive a lot of the outcomes there.", "Service charges are good. They did tick down a little bit. We have introduced these new capabilities for our customers to avoid overdraft expenses. So that\u2019s \u2013 it would be a shame to lose that revenue, but it's good for our customers and we're happy to have done that. That feels like the right thing to do. And then insurance is likely to be in the run rate for the rest of the year. We probably won't close that until the end of the year.", "And then some of the market sensitive other items will reflect the markets that we're in. So there is the story behind each of them. Most of them are in line with the five-quarter averages and I'd say mortgage is probably the item to look at in terms of what's the size of the market, what the composition of the market and what's going on with margins that reflects competition.", "Erika Najarian", "Okay. Thanks for taking my question.", "Timothy Sloan", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Hello Saul.", "Saul Martinez", "Hi, good morning. Couple questions, first on the auto portfolio, it down $2.5 billion linked-quarter. Obviously you talked about tighter underwriting standards. But how should we think about that going forward in terms of the magnitude of declines in the second half and where we're ultimately in the size of the portfolio get to? Do you have a sense for that?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes, Saul, a good question. I think that you're likely to see a continued decline in the auto portfolio through the second half of this year and my bet is it will probably stabilize sometime in the first half of next year. I think during that entire time, it's reasonable to assume that\u2019s the quality of the underlying customer, which is really key here, but the quality underlying customers measured by FICO score will continue to improve, I don\u2019t know if it will continue to improve at the levels we've seen, but it will continue to be very strong. And then my guess is, that's where the business kind of stabilized sometime in the first half of next year.", "Saul Martinez", "Okay. In the decline is really related more to pricing and not getting targeted returns than anything you're seeing from a credit standpoint, is that fair to say?", "Timothy Sloan", "No, no I think a year-ago, we look at the market and what we saw in the market was the following. And that was that \u2013 remember that majority of our originations are for our used car loans. And so we saw \u2013 we would became concerned about underlying values of the collateral because of production levels by the industry.", "The number of cars that were coming off leases, we got concerned by the risk return in terms of pricing as well as term and we took that all into consideration in terms of ramping down our originations in improving the underlying quality. And on the short-term we gave up loan growth and so the metrics are not as good. We gave maybe some short-term revenue. But over the long-term, this is how we think about credit. We're not targeting certain balance levels or anything like that, but we want to continue to underwrite in an appropriate way on a product-by-product basis.", "Timothy Sloan", "In that business, we're also reorganizing the business itself. We\u2019re collapsing lots of regional offices. More than 50 regional offices down into a number of much bigger centers and while that's going on, we\u2019ve reduced the risk profile of the portfolio and what\u2019s rolling into it. So that we can work through that reorganization with less inherent risk in the loan book and that's helpful. That\u2019s \u2013 maybe [that\u2019s in credit] to Wells Fargo when you're thinking about what this means for your auto loans in general.", "Saul Martinez", "Got it. Just adding to that, on the retail sales metrics, it seems like you kind of embedded them into the segment results or some of them into the segment results. But it seems like some of the forward-looking indicators, whether it's I guess branch banker interactions, credit card applications, don't seem to be there. And I'm just curious what the logic was there and is the trend that you have been showing which was a big step function down after the sales fraud issue and then kind of a stabilization, is that sort of what we're continuing to see in some of those forward-looking indicators?", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes. Let me start and John jump in. I think that what we're trying to do is provide you with a reflection of how we\u2019re measuring and running the business. So we changed for example, the incentive compensation plan in the first quarter. We talked about the results of that briefly. I think that we're seeing actually some very good results in terms of customer experience and a continued improvement in customer loyalty.", "I think the branch interactions are as reflective of what's going on in terms of customer choice moving more to mobile than anything else. And so when you think about our customer interactions what I would do is step back and not only look at branch interactions, but also look at the number of online and mobile interactions.", "We had a total of 1.9 billion interact customer interactions in the second quarter. And that's why it's important for example to make sure that we're investing in technologies. So a customer can open account on their mobile device set. And if they want to or they can come into one of our branches, that\u2019s fine.", "But overall, I would say that we're seeing a slow, but steady return in an improvement in underlying retail business. We still have more work to do, that\u2019s absolutely the case. Mary Mack and her team are absolutely focused on that, but we're making some progress.", "John Shrewsberry", "As we announced at Investor Day, we\u2019re changing our descriptions, our disclosures to as Tim said to emphasize what Mary thinks is important in running the business. And you can see the branch and ATM transactions and the digital transactions in the supplement, they are on Slide 20. And just specifically to your question in terms of us having a stabilization point based on some of the previous monthly disclosures, there\u2019s nothing is changed about that, things are still stable, things are going well, we're opening more than we're closing et cetera. So this just represents the pivot toward how Mary is managing the business.", "Saul Martinez", "Got it. Very clear. Thank you very much.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Hey John.", "John Shrewsberry", "Hey John.", "John Pancari", "Good morning. On the deposit side, the weakness in the deposit fees, I know you've flagged a few items, you flagged the new products introduced and you also mentioned the higher earnings credit rate. Can you give us any idea of how much those factors for each was a drag, so in other words can you just slice it up how much was attributable to the new products versus the ECR and then possibly the sales practice issue?", "Timothy Sloan", "I would say it\u2019s 50/50 between earnings credit rate and the changes that we made on overdraft. I don't \u2013 I\u2019m not specifically attributing anything to what was going on in sales practices in particular.", "John Pancari", "Okay, all right. And then also on the deposit side, the decline in the deposit balances itself. Can you give us similar color around the drivers there, how much of that is at all tied to sales practice if at all or is just other factors that are impacting the\u2026", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes, I wouldn't attribute any of the decline in sales practices, I think again the second quarter tends to have a lot of seasonality in it particularly on the consumer and the wealth side because folks get their tax refunds and then they use them. And the tax refunds were delayed a bit this year and so I think there were probably three weeks to a month delayed and we talked about that in the first quarter. So actually I think that the deposit franchise on the consumer side and the wealth side performed better than what we had expected and better than last year.", "John Shrewsberry", "So couple other items and we mentioned them earlier, but in WIM we had more customers shifting from cash into investments, so people actually moving out of cash and getting invested, so those would show up in assets under management on the WIM side. We also on any given quarter end we will have big dates for payroll, we\u2019ll have big dates for escrow payments, we\u2019ll have big dates for M&A, et cetera. And so just depending on what day of the week or what deals outstanding and what part of the cycle that occurs and those could be multi-billion dollar swing items at any point in time. So as a result, we tend to look at averages more often, and in Q2 we had a record average in deposit, so that reflects the whole business.", "John Pancari", "Yes. All right. That was the color I was looking for. And then separately on the commercial real estate side, on the lending side, I know you indicated that you're adopting a bit more of a conservative credit discipline there. Can you talk about what you're seeing? What's making you back off incrementally here? And what areas are you really stepping back from? Thanks.", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes, I apologize if you took away from my earlier comment that we're adopting a more conservative time. We've always been a conservative commercial real estate lender that's why we become the largest commercial real estate lender because you got to be able to adapt through cycles.", "Having said that from time-to-time and again, this can be quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year there's a fair amount of competition in stabilized commercial real estate projects, I mean there's lots of liquidity out there. And so this quarter there just happen to be more transactions that we\u2019ve looked at where we said, gosh, another risk return it just isn\u2019t there, but I wouldn't describe it, and that's more based on underlying risk return in an individual transaction as opposed to stepping away from any region or any product type within CRE.", "John Pancari", "Okay, great. Thanks Tim.", "Timothy Sloan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Good morning, guys.", "Timothy Sloan", "Good morning, Gerard.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Tim, can you share with us \u2013 obviously, you are centralizing a number of the processes as you guys have described and how do you ensure that you maintain the incentives or the entrepreneurial spirit, if you will, of your people in growing the business? Centralizing could kind of slow down the process for loan approvals and such? Can you share with us what you're doing to try to prevent that from happening?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, I think it\u2019s a really good question. I mean when you think about the amount of change that's happening at the Company, there is no question, there can be impacts in terms of how we're interacting with our customers. And the way that you guard against that is that you talk about it a lot, you make sure that when you're \u2013 for example centralizing all of your \u2013 our HR functions that we've got the right service level understandings between our aligned folks and our HR folks were as we centralize some of our risk functions that we've got an understanding.", "And then you encourage folks to provide feedback. You ask our enterprise functions to think about themselves as service providers and their customers are the lines of business. And as you can imagine, you get feedback in terms of the decisions we made and things you've done. And in some places you might go little bit far, you get that feedback and then you make adjustments. But I think it's \u2013 making sure you've got a plan in place, making sure that you've got the right team in place, asking folks to provide a lot of feedback and then responding to that feedback. And so far, I think we're doing a good job, but it's something we talk about a lot Gerard.", "John Shrewsberry", "And one thing I would add is that today the people who have been centralized are the same people who were serving or working in the business or for the business to be entrepreneurial and get things done. As you described, the tax will be what happens as the generation changes and we have new people.", "Timothy Sloan", "Right.", "John Shrewsberry", "We never were in the business that are in those centralized roles into they provide \u2013 how do we make sure that they provide the same level of support and service back to the business.", "Gerard Cassidy", "And John with that is there a time line? Is it we should know in two years or 18 months that you've been successful in keeping that entrepreneurial spirit or is it further out? And it just takes a while before\u2026", "John Shrewsberry", "I think the timeline is for ever\u2026", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes, the timeline is for ever, but just to be clear, like you're describing, one of the potential vulnerabilities, there is a list as long as your arm of the great things that come out of having pulled together people to provide a common service at a \u2013 in a more effective way, which creates better experiences. So the upside is huge. Not only to save money. That's a great plus. But for all of these things that our businesses we're doing for themselves. They weren't doing at it scale and now we can provide it scale with the best tools, the most highly trained people, the deepest bench. It's like, it's a benefit. So I\u2019d encourage you to think about it that way to.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Sure. And you mentioned, if I heard correctly, that people now digitally can open up accounts online. What type of loan products can people apply for and get approved for? I'm sorry, through the mobile app? What type of loan products can people actually apply for through the mobile app? For example, quick and mortgage probably familiar with they have the Rocket Mortgage that you do through the phone. Are you guys there yet with that type of product or other loan products where consumers can actually apply and get approved for them through the mobile device?", "Timothy Sloan", "So the short answer is, not enough. And that was one of the areas that we highlighted at Investor Day within our mortgage business. We're working on our own online capabilities. And right now, we're piloting it for our team members and so far the response for our team members who are taking mortgage has been very good. In fact has been much better than what our expectations were.", "And so our plan is to end to pilot that for non-team member customers later in the year and roll it out next year and we think it will be a step above anybody else in the market. On the small business side and you can \u2013 if you're a Wells Fargo customer, you can go online and you can open up or apply for a loan and will give an answer in 45 seconds or 60 seconds or something like that.", "We have more work to do from a credit card standpoint. But our goal over the next couple years is to make sure that on the consumer side, all of our products and services are available online and as many as possible on mobile, probably less likely mortgage is going to be on mobile, but we're going to improve the capabilities across the board.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great, and then just finally shifting gears on the total loan portfolio, obviously year-over-year essentially flat, but one of the growth areas has been your commercial foreign loans? They're up over 10% year-over-year? Can you share with us where that growth is coming from? Grant that I know it's less than well below 10% of total loans, but where is the growth coming from? And second, where do you see that growing to? How big could that business be, since you're seeing some good growth there?", "Timothy Sloan", "So Gerard, recall that within our Wholesale Banking business, we have a Global Financial Institutions business with offices located around the world and we have a real benefit given the quality of our balance sheet as also the quality of our products and services in terms of the relationships that we have with other financial institutions around the world. They'd like doing business with us.", "And so in the second quarter, we saw some growth. In the first quarter, we didn't see growth. In addition, when you think about what our international strategy is separate from the global financial institutions business. It's to help our customers when they want to do more business outside the U.S. or help non-U.S. customers do business here and we continue to see good benefit from that very focused strategy.", "We're not trying to be all things to all people, but gosh, if you look over the last five years or so, I think we've been growing those activities that are kind of mid double-digit rate. So I wouldn't say it's any region around the world in particular or any product set. But I think about it is over time in global financial institution and then in that very targeted global banking strategy", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.", "Timothy Sloan", "You bet. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Hey Nancy.", "Nancy Bush", "Good morning, guys. How are you?", "Timothy Sloan", "Good.", "Nancy Bush", "Yes. Couple of questions. Back to the sales practices issue, I think you mentioned that you had preliminary court approval for the $142 million settlement. Could you just summarize for us what other suits issues, et cetera that have been publicly disclosed that are out there? Is there anything major that's still outstanding at this point?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, the $142 million settlement that was preliminary approved by the court. We believe addresses the other class action suits that are sales practices related. I think there are about 10 that are out there. So we have high expectations that ultimately that preliminary approval will become final approval after we execute on what we're being \u2013 we agreed to do, which of course we're going to do that. In terms of other activities out there, we have consent orders and plans that were for both OCC and the CFPB that we need to comply with and we're working very hard to be able to do that.", "And has been discussed, there's been \u2013 there is an investigation that's still going on by the Justice Department and we will continue to provide more disclosures in the disclosure of that in the 10-Q in the 10-K, but there's nothing really new that's different in the 10-Q as it relates to other legal matters for sales practices with the exception of the announcement of this preliminary approval from the court on this settlement.", "Nancy Bush", "The CFPB\u2019s recent move on arbitration versus class action or versus lawsuits, I mean I'm assuming that will not be retroactive, I mean if you had a chance to sort of look at that and see if it's going to have any impact on what happens going forward?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, I think that lots of folks have had an opinion on this and not only in Washington, but also various business groups and so on. I'm not going to applying on the legality or illegality of what they're doing whether it's retroactive \u2013 I don't think it's retroactive. But I think there is a lot of concern about this decision and I think that my guess is that based on the feedback that we'll see legislative or administrative and legal action against it.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. And just finally on the subject, there have been several large municipalities that have several relationships with Wells Fargo. I think New York City may have been the last one, you have to refresh me on that. But is there \u2013 I mean my understanding of this municipalities business, and it's primarily liquidity management, it tends not to be terribly profitable business et cetera, I mean obviously you don't want to lose it, but I'm just trying to see if there are any trends that we can sort of track to that right now and where to look on the income statement to see if there is an impact?", "Timothy Sloan", "Sure. But overall, I think the punch line is there hasn't been a material impact to the Company for all the decisions made or some of the decisions made by some of our municipal customers. But you're right, there been some cities, some states who put us on a freeze or put us on probation or something for some period of time because they want to see that we're going to fulfill the obligations that we have related to sales practice and of course we're going to do that.", "And our expectation Nancy is that we're going to win all that business back. A great example is the State of California recently put us on probation and then we competed very hard and won some municipal business because we provided the best option for the citizens of California and for the state.", "The fact of the matter is that there's a lot of reporting on when politicians stand before a podium and talk about how they want to put us a freeze on Wells Fargo for a while. It doesn't get reported is the fact that most of our municipal and GIB customers are continuing to do business with. They love working with Wells Fargo.", "And in fact, one example of that is, you saw the growth and balances in the second quarter of $1.1 billion in our Government and Institutional Banking business. So that business continues to perform well, we're going to win all the business back and we're going to fulfill the obligations that we\u2019ve and promises we've made all those customers.", "John Shrewsberry", "One nuance to your question, Nancy, you mentioned it tends to be the portion of the business at least profitable. Most of these relationships are complex relationships where we're a credit provider. We're managing their cash because a very few institutions can manage liquidity and manage cash like we do.", "And then we might also be doing some investing for them or some bond placement for them or some risk management stuff for them and the ones that I've tracked since we\u2019ve begun usually we've been sort as Tim describes it put the box for a year or for two years on bond underwritings.", "But it's \u2013 they go through a painstaking process to pick their partners on who provides credit and who manages their cash. And it takes years to switch those things, if they decided to and we have a tenancy not to want to do that. So the core underlying piece of the business tends to be actually quite good.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. Thank you.", "Timothy Sloan", "Yes, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Great, thanks. So I had a quick question, first I think an easier one on the oil and gas loan portfolio I know the reserve still at almost 8% for the overall portfolio, but given the slight pullback in the oil prices, could you give us kind of a little bit color on the portfolio today versus where it was [indiscernible], is there a actual number for oil prices per barrel that you kind of get more concerns about your oil book?", "John Shrewsberry", "Also on your last question first, I wouldn't say there's an exact price. The production is migrated to the most efficient producers. So whatever that prices that would make people disturb, it's a lower price than what you might have thought a couple of years-ago. The portfolio overall is now about 1.3% of our total loan portfolio, $12.7 billion is down 10% year-over-year.", "We had $20 million of charge-offs in the portfolio this quarter, which is down $80 million from the prior quarter. Oil and gas not accruals or at $1.8 billion down called it $230 million linked-quarter, criticized assets are $4.5 billion down $0.5 billion linked-quarter and the remaining oil as you said is almost 8% outstanding.", "So I think we feel good about where we are. We got after this early, we built reserves against it to what we thought was the right level and then we're coming out the other side of it. We the whole it's of course more than keeping an eye on the price of crude, this is both an oil and gas business and we've got hundreds of professionals in market. We\u2019re working with all of our customers all the time to help them manage down the risk and it doesn't feel like an area of concern in the resource prices, the neighborhood that we\u2019re operating in.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Okay. And then on the primary consumer checking customers, I know there's still more opening and closing at this point in time, but the growth rate is still decelerating. So do you have a better handle on one that will actually start to inflect and see a better growth rate, I know you\u2019ve done investments in the marketing spend picked up this year. I mean is it next quarter we should see that inflect. Is that the fourth quarter, can you some insight on the timing there?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, I think it's going to continue to occur over time and I think that that it's - I wouldn't say the inflections tomorrow or a week from tomorrow or next quarter I think our expectation is that we're going to continue to grow from the current levels and being - every quarter is a little bit different. But my encouragement of view is to look a year from now and see where we are.", "John Shrewsberry", "Little more context on that metric because we've been pointing towards relying on that metric and increasingly over the last couple of years and in the early days of really emphasizing that metric, one of the things that we were working through is the conversion of customers who were Wells Fargo customers, but we're primary customers to a primary status by encouraging them to do that giving them reasons to do it, giving them capabilities et cetera, but a compelling value proposition.", "And so setting sales practices aside, we had been working through that stock of people who were already customers, but weren\u2019t primary. So in any event even if we hadn't had sale practices issues that was going to slow down. Now we've got the sales practices issues to recover from and we also have the fact that we've converted as many or probably as many as are going to be converted from non-primary status. So it's really going to reflect taking business from other people and getting more than our fair share of new household formation or new bank customer formation as it happens over time.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Yes, perfect. Thanks.", "Timothy Sloan", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.", "Timothy Sloan", "Hey Marty.", "John Shrewsberry", "Hi, Marty.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks for taking the questions. I want to talk about mortgage banking. It used to be a real powerhouse for Wells Fargo. And couple of years ago on Investor Day, we actually had a mortgage banking \u2013 talk about [indiscernible] finally turn the corner after we come out of this financial crisis.", "And here we have a seasonal quarter where you sort of seen an uptick and we actually had treasury rates falling, which should have been a better delivery quarter, but we have margins fell off. So just the innate trends and metrics of the business just don't think to be working the way that I\u2019ve grown used to it in my history, so I was just interested to see how you think about the business and how do we get this thing turned around?", "Timothy Sloan", "Well, Marty I might push back just a bit and that is that one of the decisions that we've made over the last few years is to make sure that we're building this business for the long-term and to eliminate any portions of the business that we would describe is providing additional amount of risk. So we got out of the wholesale funding or wholesale mortgage we've got out of reverse mortgages.", "We exited the direct FHA business because of the potential liabilities and so during the period that you're describing what we've been trying to do is really build the business for the long-term. We made most of \u2013 all those changes, and now as we look toward the future, we think it's really critical to make sure that we've got for example that online product that Gerard ask about, and which we're in process of and it will be rolling out next year.", "And our expectation is that we will continue to grow this business in the short term. As John mentioned what happened this quarter was just the mix between correspondent and direct shifted a little bit. But also remember in the background that because of the size of our servicing book in periods where there's a lot of refinance activity, we get a disproportionate amount of share relative to the rest of the industry proportionate for us.", "So I wouldn't throw in the towel on the mortgage business. There is huge opportunities here. There is huge opportunities to grow the first mortgage business. There is huge opportunities to grow the second mortgage business, and Franklin and team are very focused on that.", "John Shrewsberry", "One more thing I\u2019d add Marty that doesn't show up in the mortgage banking line item, but we're making non-conforming prime jumbo mortgage loans handover for our best customers and then they show up on our balance sheet. So they contribute to net interest income, but they don't flow through the mortgage banking line item in the same way.", "And so we think the business is the combination of those things, some of it\u2019s shifted because of our emphasis on higher credit quality and that loan balance cutoff, puts those on our books. So there\u2019s a variety of things, all de-risking. Last thing I\u2019d say is that, as I mentioned for those loans that are on our books and we are the biggest mortgage lender, we had a net recovery in credit in the quarter. So we like the credit profile that we're putting on our books as well.", "Marty Mosby", "Got it. So really is that holding more on the balance sheet as well, like you were saying kind of retooling the business. So this should be the kind of basing of that and we should hopefully begin to see some improvement in the market and the business now being able to improve from here. So that hopefully will be what we'll see over the next couple years.", "And the other thing I want to ask you about was when I looked at your deposit rates, what would be your MMDA or kind of the savings, money market savings aligned where the majority of your deposits are, the rate has done really well had increased several basis points. But the line right above it, which is really the checking account has been going up almost with the Fed fund rate, so it's somewhat surprising that your checking account is going up faster than your savings account. So it has to be kind of an anomaly in that account. Is that just more corporate related? Is that how you kind of classify it? Or was just curious why that rate is moving up so fast?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, that's more commercial and corporate-related. On the consumer side because of the service convenience that we can provide \u2013 as we've talked about in the past, we were trying not to compete on price, and that's what you're seeing across the rest of the industry. I think the growth that you're seeing is primarily on the commercial in the corporate side, particularly medium and larger corporate some financial institution were candidly, it\u2019s much more price sensitive. It's still been increasing at less than the rise in short-term rates, but that's what explains it.", "Marty Mosby", "And the checking account just more is that more Treasury type of products in that, what you actually show interest-bearing checking is that first line on that supplement?", "Timothy Sloan", "They\u2019re indexed to a variety of things, but\u2026", "Marty Mosby", "Right, got it.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.", "John Campbell ", "Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn our call over to CEO and President, Tim Sloan.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you, John. Good morning. I want to thank you all for joining us today. Over the past year, we have made fundamental changes at Wells Fargo in order to build a better and stronger bank. And John and I'll be highlighting our progress throughout the call. But first I want to discuss our financial performance. ", "In the third quarter, we earned $0.84 a share; including the impact of a $1 billion discrete litigation accrual for previously disclosed mortgage related regulatory investigations. This is not tax deductible and reduced our EPS by $0.20. This accrual was for a pre financial crisis mortgage related regulatory matter. While this accrual impacted our financial performance in the quarter, the commitment of our team members to put our customers first and help them to succeed financially remains strong and was demonstrated by average deposits growing 4% from a year ago, client assets reaching record levels in wealth and investment management, debit card purchase volume increasing 5% from a year ago, balances in our consumer and general purpose credit card portfolio also growing 5%. And illustrating the benefit of the GE Capital acquisitions and strong collaboration across our wholesale businesses, we led more syndicated asset base loans in any other firm in the third quarter. ", "As part of our priority of rebuilding trust, we provided expanded disclosure in our second quarter 10-Q filing, detailing our efforts to identify and address other areas and instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Let me update you on a few recent actions and milestones. At the end of August, we announced the completion of an expanded third party review of retail banking accounts covering 165 million accounts over a nearly eight year period. As we committed to a year ago we reviewed more accounts over a longer period of time and identified additional customers who may have been impacted. All customers identified as having potentially unauthorized accounts are being notified directly as to how they can participate in a $142 million class action settlement and we are refunding customers for any of these accounts that experienced fees and charges. Last week we completed another around of broad customer outreach via email in 43 million statement notifications to encourage anyone with questions about their accounts regardless of when they were opened to let us know so we could address their questions. ", "We also announced in August a plan to remediate auto loan customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to collateral protection insurance policies which we purchased on their behalf when customers' insurance policies lapsed. We discontinued our CPI program last year and we began issuing checks to affected auto loan customers this month. Last week, we announced plans to reach out to all home lending customers who paid fees for mortgage rate lock extensions requested from September 16th of 2013 through February 28th of 2017 and to refund customers who believe they shouldn't have paid those fees. ", "In March of this year, we changed how we managed the mortgage rate lock extension process by establishing a centralized review team that reviews all rate lock extension request for a consistent application of our policies. We are working diligently to make things right for our customers. We will continue to be transparent and we will be reporting more progress in months ahead. ", "We are working hard to transform Wells Fargo into a better bank for our customers, our team members, shareholders and our communities. I'm proud of the progress our team members have made to strengthen our culture, improve our business practices and risk management. We made fundamental changes to our business model, organizational structure and compensation and performance management programs. One reason I am confident that we are on the right path is it in the third quarter total team member attrition at Wells Fargo reached its lowest level in over six years. Within Community Banking, attrition is also at its lowest level in over six years and it has improved every quarter over the past year. Our customers are also responding positively to the changes we've made. While branch customer loyalty and satisfaction with most recent visit scores decline slightly in September after our announcement of the completion of the expanded third party account review, both metrics had reached individual post sales practices settlements high earlier in the quarter. And we saw improvement in loyalty scores near the end of the September.", "We also continue to invest in innovation to better serve our customers. Let me highlight a few examples. Since launching the Zelle person-to-person experience in June, we've seen significant growth in both the number of transactions and the dollar sent. In the third quarter, P-to-P payment sent by our customers increased 46% from a year ago. We've recently launched a pilot of our online mortgage application. It combines the power of Wells Fargo data with the digital interface to create a know-me customer experience. We expect a complete rollout in the first quarter of next year.", "Later this month, we'll rollout Intuitive Investor, a new digital advisory offering providing low cost allocation, portfolio selection and rebalancing. We launched CEO Mobile Token which allows our treasury management customers a secured, convenient way to provide secondary authentication anytime they need to complete a transaction. Since the first quarter when we became the first large bank in the US to offer card free access to all of our ATMs through a one time access code, our customers have used card free ATM access codes 3 million times. And just this last we week announced than more than 40% of our ATMs are now NFC- enabled which allows our debit card customers to use their mobile wallet at the ATM providing another option for card free access. ", "Citing our card free ATMs along with a number of new capabilities, Wells Fargo was also recognized as the industry leader in Business Insider's mobile banking study that was released this week. ", "Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge the devastation many of our communities have faced from the recent hurricanes. To help our impacted customers in those areas recover we are providing payment relief and proactively waiving fees. Our mobile response unit was deployed to impacted areas in Texas a month ago and we are deploying three additional units to Florida so customers can receive in person assistance from Wells Fargo disaster recovery specialist. The Wells Fargo Foundation donated $2.6 million for hurricane relief efforts in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, and our customers have generously donated over $2.6 million to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund through our ATMs nationwide. We are also working with our customers impacted by the wildfires in California and the Wells Fargo Foundation made a donation to help these communities this week. ", "John Shrewsberry will now discuss our financial results in more detail. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We earned $4.6 billion in the third quarter, down $1.2 billion from the second quarter. This decline was driven by higher operating losses from the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual that Tim described. Linked-quarter trends were also impacted by the $100 million reserve release we had in the second quarter. This quarter we did not have a release as improvements and credit performance in certain portfolios were offset by a $450 million of reserve coverage for potential hurricane related losses based on initial review of our portfolio. As a reminder, our result in the second quarter also reflected a $309 million gain on the sale of Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio. ", "On Page 3, we highlighted our results compared with a year ago. While net interest income increased $524 million, revenue declined $402 million reflecting lower non-interest income, driven by lower mortgage results. Average loans declined 1% from a year ago as grown in our commercial loans was more than offset by lower consumer loans, while average deposits increased 4% from a year ago. And we've maintained exceptionally strong capital levels even as we've returned more capital to shareholders including $96 million reduction in common shares outstanding through net share repurchases. ", "Turning to Page 4, I'll be highlighting trends in loans deposits and credit later on the call, so let me just call out a few items from this slide. Cash and short-term investments increased to $7.4 billion, reflecting lower loan balances and growth in deposits. With our strong liquidity levels we could deploy tens of billions of dollars and remain LCR compliant. ", "Investment securities increased $5 billion in the quarter, we had approximately $31.2 billion of gross investment purchases in the quarter, primary agency MBS in the available for sale portfolio which were largely offset by run-off in sales.", "Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5, I'll describe revenue and expense trends later on the call. So let me just highlight that our effective income tax rate in the third quarter was 32.4%. This included net discrete tax expense of $186 million primarily resulting from the non deductible treatment of the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual, partially offset by discrete tax benefits arising from favorable resolutions of prior period matter of certain state tax authorities. ", "As shown on Page 6, the benefit from higher rates increased average loan yields 5 basis points in the quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter of increasing loan yields. Average loan yields were down $5.2 billion from a year ago with growth in commercial loans offset by declines in consumer loans and down $4.6 billion from the second quarter with declines in both commercial and consumer loans. H.8 data continue to indicate that there was softness across the industry, particularly in certain categories like C&I, but they're also specific actions that we've taken, primarily driven by our own risk discipline, which have impacted our growth.", "Let me explain the primary factors in more detail. Starting with commercial loans on Page 7, lien utilization rate remain stable at approximately 40% in the third quarter and balance is increased $3.7 billion from a year ago, but declined $5.7 billion from the second quarter. We've previously highlighted expected run-off within our consumer portfolio but we've also had expected run-off in certain portfolios of commercial loan. We provided $6.5 billion of financing relating to our government guarantee student loan sale in the fourth quarter of 2014 which is then securitized in several tranches over the past couple of years with $1.3 billion remaining at the end of the third quarter down approximately $800 million from the second quarter. ", "We fully anticipated the run down of a couple of loan portfolios we acquired from GE Capital and pay downs have totaled $7.9 billion over the past 18 months including $1.7 billion in the third quarter with approximately half of the reduction in the quarter in C&I and half in commercial real estate. On this slide we provide details on the individual loan portfolios that drove commercial loan trends this quarter. ", "We summarize our consumer loan portfolios on Page 8. This portfolio declined $13.1 billion from a year-ago, primarily due to $7.4 billion of lower auto loans and $7 billion of lower junior lien mortgage loans. However, consumer loans increased $200 million from the second quarter with growth in first mortgage loans and credit card.", "Our first mortgage loans increased $3.6 billion from the second quarter, reflecting $7.5 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans, partially offset by the continued run-off of higher yielding legacy portfolios.", "Our junior lien mortgage loan portfolio continued to decline as expected as pay-downs more than offset new originations. In terms of credit card portfolio, over the past three years our annual growth rate was the largest among the large banks. Clearly the sales practice announcement last year had an impact but we started gain a bit of momentum. Our credit portfolio increased $944 million linked quarter driven by higher spend per active account. We've invested in our rewards program and had continued our migration to digital acquisition while staying within our risk appetite. In fact, 42% of card openings in the third quarter were through digital channels, up from 17% in the full year of 2016. Our auto portfolio continued to decline as expected and was down $2.5 billion from the second quarter as a result of tightening underwriting standards. We expect auto loans to continue to decline.", "Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $252 million from the second quarter driven by declines in personal loans and lines which we expect to continue to decline due to lower branch referrals over the past year. ", "As highlighted on Page 9, average deposits were $1.3 trillion, up $44.9 billion or 4% from a year-ago and up $5.2 billion from the second quarter. Based on the latest FDIC data, we retained our number one ranking in retail deposits. Our deposit cost was 26 basis points in the third quarter, up 5 basis points from the second quarter and up 15 basis points from a year ago. We've not made material changes in rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits within our retail bank with the majority of our peers also holding these rates steady. We have implemented some incremental deposits repricing for commercial and wealth and investment management customers as market rates have increased. ", "Net interest income increased $524 million, or 4% from a year-ago primarily driven by growth in earnings assets and higher interest rates. However, net interest income declined $7 million from the second quarter as the impacts of lower investment portfolio yields driven by accelerated prepayments and lower average loan balances were largely offset by the impact of one additional day in the quarter and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing. ", "The net interest margin declined 3 basis points to 2.87% as the impact of lower investment portfolio yields driven by accelerated prepayments, lower average loan balances, growth in average deposits and growth in trading assets and related funding were partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing.", "For the first nine months of the year, we've growth net interest income by 5% which is consistent with our previously stated expected of low to mid-single digit growth for the full year 2017. ", "Non-interest income declined $926 million from a year-ago, driven by lower mortgage banking revenue and was $236 million from the second quarter. Let me highlight few of the drivers of this decline. Card purchase volume increased but card fees declined $19 million from the second quarter due to higher reward expense. We offered competitive rewards and our expense is increased due to high purchase volume, more spending on our highest reward card and higher acquisition bonuses. ", "Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $102 million from the second quarter. Servicing income declined $91 million from the second quarter primarily due to higher on reimburse direct servicing cost driven by an increased and estimated cost for aged FHA foreclosures while origination volume increased, residential mortgage origination revenue decline due to a lower repurchase reserve release. Residential mortgage origination volume was $59 billion in the third quarter, up 5% from the second quarter and higher refinancing volume. The production margin on residential held for sale mortgage origination was 124 basis points in the third quarter consistent with the second quarter. Compared with the second quarter there was a favorable impact of $72 million from net hedge ineffectiveness accounting. The FASB has issued new hedge accounting guideline that we will adopt in the fourth quarter which will significantly reduce the interest rate related to foreign currency related ineffectiveness associated with our long-term debt hedges due to the way we structured our hedging instruments, we may continue to experience some ineffectiveness volatility primarily related to require differences in the discount rates for our foreign currency denominated long-term debt and associated cross - currency interest rate swaps. ", "On Page 12, we provide details on trading related revenue and the impact to net interest income and non-interest income. Despite decline in customer trading activity, revenue driven by lower volatility and seasonally lower trading volumes, trading related revenue increased $52 million from the second quarter. Trading related revenue was down $29 million from a year ago, reflecting lower volatility and lower transaction volume. ", "As shown on Page 13, expenses increased $810 million from the second quarter, driven by $1 billion litigation accrual. The discrete litigation accrual increased our efficiency ratio by 456 basis points in the third quarter. Last quarter we said that we expected our efficiency ratio to improve in the second half of the year and that our full year efficiency ratio was expected to be 60% to 61% in 2017 not including any potential non-recurring expenses including not get accrued litigation expense. We currently expect our full year 2017 efficiency ratio to be plus or minus 61% excluding the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual and any other non-recurring expenses including not yet accrued litigation expense. The reason why our 2017 efficiency ratio is now expected to be higher than we anticipated last quarter is due to lower than expected earning asset growth and higher than expected expenses, primarily for cyber regulatory initiatives and data modernization. These expenses are part of a building a better bank. However, we are fully committed to improving our efficiency ratio and achieving our target of total of $4 billion of expense reductions.", "As you can see on Page 14, we had linked quarter declines across many of our expense categories except for revenue related expenses and running the business non discretionary expenses which is a category impacted by the $1 billion litigation accrual. The increase in revenue related expenses was primarily due to higher commissions and other incentive compensation driven by wholesale banking and brokerage. The $24 million decline in compensation expense was driven by seasonally lower payroll tax expense. Third party service expense declined $82 million from the second quarter driven by lower project related, legal and outside data processing expense. Running the business discretionary expense was down $34 million from second quarter primarily from lower TNE and advertising expense. ", "On Page 15, we showed the drivers of the year-over-year increase and expenses. Compensation and benefit expense increased $338 million driven by higher salaries from annual salary increases and higher health benefit expenses. Also these expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were reduced by the forfeiture of unvested equity award. Revenue related expense declined $131 million from lower commission and incentive compensation driven by lower mortgage and wholesale banking activity. ", "Third party service expense increased to $184 million, driven by higher project spending and legal expense, approximately $80 million of this expense was sales practices related in the third quarter. The $665 million increase in running the business in non-discretionary expense was driven by higher operating losses reflecting the $1 billion litigation accrual.", "We've previously described the main drivers of the first $2 billion of targeted expense saves by the end of 2018 and we've now identified initiatives and programs for the total $4 billion of expense target. On Page 16, we summarize these initiatives and the expense categories that will be impacted and we are committed to achieving these reductions. This leverage have evolved slightly from Investor Day but are still focused on areas like centralization and optimization and evaluating capacity to achieve savings in areas such as corporate properties and workforce optimization. As you can see on this page, some of these initiatives will generate savings throughout the periods while others unexpected to be realized until later. ", "We are making progress and work that needs to be done on these initiatives but many of the changes that drive savings are longer term efforts and are in the early stages of being realized. For example, while we are seeing benefits from centralizing our functional areas, the saving for corporate property including savings from 200 branches we plan to close in 2017. We are on track as we closed 145 branches during the first nine months of this year. However, there are minimal immediate savings recognized from branch closure due to initial closing cost. Therefore, most of the expense benefit from the branches we close this year will not be realized until next year. It's also important to note that these initiatives do not include the benefit of the expected run-off of core deposit intangibles by 2019 which resulted in $640 million of expenses in the first nine months of the year. It also doesn't include the expected completion of the FDIC special assessment in 2018. And finally it doesn't include the expense savings due to the sale of businesses we've announced including commercial insurance and shareowner services businesses which are expected to close in the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively. ", "On Slide 17, we provide details on the expected timing of our target expense reductions. We expect to achieve 21% of the $4 billion of the annual expense saves by the end of this year and 50% by the end of next year. The rest of the expense saves are expected to be achieved by the end of 2019. As a reminder, the first $2 billion of targeted expense saves will support our investment in the business and we expect that the additional $2 billion target in annual expense reduction by the end of 2019 to go to the bottom line and to be fully recognized in 2020.", "Turning to our business segments starting on Page 18, Community Banking earned $2.2 billion in the third quarter, the impact from $1 billion litigation accrual which is reported in this segment was the primary driver of the year-over-year and linked quarter decline. ", "On Page 19, we highlight customers continue to actively use their accounts; branch and ATM interactions declined 6% from a year ago. This decline was driven in part by customers migrating to a digital channel with the digital secured session up 6% from a year ago. As teller interactions migrate to self service options, teller FTEs have been reduced 4% from a year ago while we continue to invest in more specialty bankers which are up 5% as part of our goal of providing better customer service and advice. ", "Primary consumer checking customers declined modestly from the second quarter in a year ago, while our attrition rates have remained stable, the decline in new account openings has impacted primary consumer checking customer growth. However, as we've highlighted in Investor Day, our new customers continue to have higher balances and into use their debit cards more frequently. ", "On Page 20, we highlight balance and activity growth. Average consumer and small business banking deposits grew by 2% from a year-ago. Debit card purchase volume increased 5% and consumer and general purpose credit card purchase volume increased 4% from a year-ago. Customer experience survey scores predictably declined after we announced the completion of the expanded third party review of retail banking accounts at the end of August. However, as Tim mentioned earlier, we continue to improve these scores prior to this announcement. While this past year has been challenging, the numbers we've made are creating more consistency -- the changes we've made are creating more consistency and simplicity for our branch team members which will result in a better experience for our customers. We know that improving the experience for customers and team members is critical to growing our business. It's more than being nice it's offering the right products and services to meet the financial needs of our customers; it's also about making changes with real customer impact for example empowering managers in the branches to immediately resolve some customer issues such as fees and service request rather than having to redirect customers to a call center. I am confident that the changes we are implementing will improve customer service and also drive growth. ", "Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, stable from a year-ago and down 14% from the second quarter. Results from the second quarter included the tax benefit resulting from our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance Services which is expected to close in the fourth quarter and resulted to gain in fourth quarter. ", "Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $710 million in the third quarter, up 5% from a year-ago and up 4% from the second quarter. Revenue increased 4% from a year-ago driven by 19% increase in net interest income. WIM total client assets were a record $1.9 trillion, up 8% from a year ago, driven by higher market evaluations and continued positive net flows.", "Turning to credit quality on Page 23, the quarterly loss rate was 30 basis points, up 3 basis points from the second quarter but still near historically low levels. Commercial losses increased 3 basis points with higher losses in C&I, consumer losses increased 2 basis points as continued net recoveries in consumer real estate and lower credit card and other revolving credit were offset by higher auto losses.", "Nonperforming assets continue to decline down $512 million from the second quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of decreases and NPAs were now less than 1% of total loans. We did not have a reserve build or release this quarter as continued improvement in consumer real estate and commercial loan portfolios including continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio was offset by a $450 million of reserve coverage for potential hurricane related losses based on an initial review of our portfolio. Our preliminary estimates includes coverage for potential losses in our reliable auto business which is based in Puerto Rico was been specially challenging to determine the full impact from Hurricane Maria. ", "Turning to Page 24, our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in increased to 11.8% in the third quarter, remaining well above our internal target level of 10%. The growth in our CET 1 ratio reflected lower RWA driven by lower loan balances and commitments, as well as improved RWA efficiency. We remained focused on returning more capital to shareholders. Third quarter was the first quarter under our 2017 Capital Plan and we increased our net share repurchases by 34% from the second quarter. We've returned the total of $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases which was up 16% from the second quarter. ", "Before I conclude, I want to update you on our resolution planning efforts. We made a decision to move from a multiple point of entry resolution strategy to a single point of entry preferred resolution strategy for our next resolution plan submission. We've concluded the developing SPOE strategy will enhance the flexibility of strategic options available to resolve the firm. This decision does not related to any agency feedback we've received in our 2017 submission and is not expected to result in any additional fee lock issuance or liquidity requirements. ", "In summary, while our financial results in the third quarter were impacted by the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual, our asset quality, liquidity and capital levels all remain very strong. We highlighted throughout the call the transformational changes we are making and I am optimistic that these changes will help drive our long-term success. And I think we will now take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. ", "John McDonald", "Hi, good morning. John, I want to try again to ask about the idea of the timing differences between initial $2 billion of expense saves to be realized by the end of next year. And when the spending that is offsetting that is occurring, if you could kind of comment on that. And then if you have an initial thought on type of efficiency ratio that you guys might strive for next year. I am sure folks will love to hear any thoughts on that. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. So we provided this slide on the deck this time that shows what portion of that first $2 billion should be out of the run rate by the end of this year and what portion should be out of the run rate by the end of next year which is incremental information. The part that's hard to convey is what is already being spent as reinvestment of that for a variety of programs. We've talked about a lot of these but we've had and will continue to have elevated spending around various regulatory and technology related activities. Now just tick few off for you including resolution planning this year which doesn't completely go away. This BSA and AML activity going on, lot of cyber work going on. I mentioned data modernization earlier in our remarks which is a big undertaking is technology re-platforming and this of course your sales practices issues that are lingering. So some of those are in the run rate today. And many of those will continue to be in the run rate throughout 2018 and maybe some of it even into 2019. There are bits and pieces of getting more efficient on those programs that are part of that $2 billion save that we are working on. So it's not dollar for dollar if as these things roll off and that first $2 billion gets realized those benefit, but with respect to efficiency ratio we think that will be sort in the -- as I mentioned plus or minus 61% from the fourth quarter and it is definitely our goal to be at 59% or below at some point next year. Now there is two parts to that. One is expenses which we are talking about but it is also what happens with revenue. So rate increases, if there are any loan growth which is very important will contribute to that too. So it is both the numerator and denominator that we are working on. But I'll say we are shooting for plus or minus 61% in the fourth quarter and we are -- we like to get to 59% or below at some point during 2018.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And then separately could you talk about some of the factors affecting net interest income and net interest margin for next quarter? With the loan growth headwinds not having a rate hike in September, is it possible to have net interest income growth going forward or what are your thoughts there? ", "John Shrewsberry", "That's good question. So it depends on a few things including what you mentioned. It also depends on what happens to deposit pricing and what the market response is in retail deposits in particular. I wouldn't anticipate a lot of incremental growth in interest income in the fourth quarter. I think we are at 5% [here today] [ph] on year-over-year basis and we've been imagining and telegraphing low to mid 4% to 5% for the year as a whole. So I think the fourth quarter will probably reflect that especially because as you said nothing moved on short end, the long ends moved a little bit but that only matters at the margin as we reinvest. ", "John McDonald", "Okay. And one quick last one for me. The business sales that you mentioned in the fourth quarter and the first are helpful to the efficiency ratio. Are those relatively earnings neutral? Is there any loss of earnings as those businesses go away? ", "John Shrewsberry", "They are relatively earnings -- the run rate which I think is what you are referring to is relatively earnings neutral going forward. ", "John McDonald", "Okay. Meaning when you sell them there is no net income that goes away, they are pretty P&L neutral. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. The only complication that adds is indirect expense because we have a work to do take up the associated indirect expense but in general I'd say that that we will not be giving up a lot of net income.", "John McDonald", "Okay. Meaning you will just take some time to get the expenses out.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes.", "John McDonald", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Erika Najarian", "Yes. Hi, thank you for taking my questions. My first question is for you Tim. I think that as I speak with your current and prospective shareholders, the biggest sort of question mark in terms of visibility into next year is not really on the expense management side but really on the revenue side. You started out this call with the list of the remedies that you've done on the community bank. I guess the question for me is in terms of the overall culture of the bank how much is the wholesale bank being impacted by the issues and the scandal on the community bank? In other words, is it impacting risk appetite? Is it impacting growth initiatives? Is it impacting your ability to hire? ", "Tim Sloan", "The short answer as it relates to wholesale banking, Erika, it is a great question, is no, I mean at the margin and our government and institutional banking business. There is a little bit of impact on some municipalities they have put us on probation or just said they are not going to use as much for a period of time. Though we had some municipalities that have taken us off that because we've executed on everything we said we are going to execute over the last year. So it's not impacting our ability to hire people. And I mentioned attrition for the entire company but the same would go for wholesale banking in terms of lower attrition so we are not losing people. And is not affecting our credit appetite at all. And again I think wholesale banking performance in the quarter was good and I'd say the same thing for wealth and investment management. I mean you saw real good performance there. So there is no question that there is impact. We've talked about that. John provided a number of details in his presentation as it relates to some of our consumer businesses but for the rest of the company we are continuing to move forward. ", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. And just thank you so much for providing the new slide, slide 17, in terms of what we can expect to be achieved when. And I am wondering as we think about 4Q, 2019, John, is it a simple as saying okay let's assume a core run rate for Wells Fargo, let's say it's the $13.3 billion this quarter excluding the $1 billion in litigation accrual, assume a growth rate off of that and then deduct $500 million. Is that what falling to the bottom line means by 4Q, 2019?", "John Shrewsberry", "That's elegant but I guess the way I think about it -- I think about it is you got to take a snapshot of a business mix that throws off its -- each component which throws of its own efficiency ratio and I expect us frankly to get more efficient in the businesses as we roll forward. But as you look forward a year we should have taken out call it 40% of the first $2 billion and the rest of it to be coming out at the end of next year. So obviously that will be phasing-in through that period of time. You will have these harder to gauge elevated program related expenses for the types of items that I mentioned that sort of happening over the top. They have been for a little while and I anticipate the next 12 or 18 months will be -- there will be a lot of it going on. So I don't know much will be rolling off exactly at the end of the next -- nobody knows exactly how much will be rolling off at the end of next year. But that's a big number. And then we began to have this structural take out like the amortization, deposit intangible, the extra FDIC premium and the cost of the exited businesses although those will be happening earlier in 2018. So those are the moving pieces as I see them. Now with something new could occur to that changes the business but those are the big items and the way that are moving that as we forecast through 2018 and into 2019 are the drivers of where we are going to be. And with that an expectation for revenue that's what makes us think that we will get down to 61% for 2017 in the fourth quarter and hope to get to 59% in 2018.", "Erika Najarian", "And just one last question, a follow up on the revenue side of the 2018 efficiency equation. Is there idiosyncratic catalyst for the margin decline that you would like to point out that impacted performance for this year? Or maybe a better way to ask if the Fed does raise rate in December could you walk us through what the impact would be for 1Q, 2018 that would be perhaps different from what we saw this quarter? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. So with respect to year-over-year margin and what's going on I mean it's what you imagine. We've got different categories of earnings assets they are priced differently investment securities loans, short -term investment et cetera. We've got mix and we have repricing. And the sort of weighted average of that matrix is the benefit in a rising rate environment, and then we've got deposits, we've got long-term debt, other funding liabilities, we've got mix and we've got repricing that's the negative in a rising rate environment. And that's what -I think we are five basis points up year-over-year but if there is a move in December and we roll into the beginning of the year and the easy calculation is actually our parallel move, so I'll give you the number for a parallel move. We think that's probable all things being equal that's probably worth $90 million a quarter including in the first quarter. So now things don't happen in parallel. We don't know what's going to happen at the longer end but and the big question mark about that is what is the deposit response in retail that bigger banks either cause or impacted by on the next move because we model a reasonably meaningful response and yet we haven't seen what yet so there could be upside to that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Ken Usdin", "Hey, guys, how are doing? Good morning. Hey, can you talk a little bit about just the loan growth expectations? I know John in your prepared remarks you talked through a couple of the buckets where you are continuing to let things roll off. But obviously we are seeing the period end come in lower than the averages in part because of that. Can you just talk about end demand and try to separate end demand and customer growth from perhaps any lagging ramification of retail sales and the slower account growth in terms of how you expect loans to traject going forward?", "Tim Sloan", "Ken, it's Tim. You are talking about fourth quarter next year in term from the timeframe standpoint? ", "Ken Usdin", "Yes. Just your general outlook for when do you we see kind of bottoming in loan growth and how much of that kind of let go part is weighing on the overall amount of growth that you are seeing? ", "Tim Sloan", "So let me start with the portfolios that are likely to decline over that period and then we'll get to the ones that are going to increase. So as we've highlighted for last few quarters, I think it's likely that the auto portfolio will continue to decline over the next few quarters. Our expectation is it probably bottom out sometime second half of next year. I think the home equity portfolio will also continue to decline though our expectation is that next year all other things being equal will originate more home equity loan than what we did this year. But again recall there still that legacy portion of that portfolio that's burning off that we used to be very concerned about from a loss standpoint and it is now performing beyond all of our expectations. I expect the credit card portfolio to continue to grow. We saw that this quarter that was absolutely terrific driven by some really good improvement in digital acquisition. And so all the investments that we are making in the credit card business and our digital platform are working. I expect the on balance sheet mortgage portfolio to grow during that period. There will be some seasonality in the fourth and first quarter we've seen but again like we saw this quarter, we saw good growth in the first mortgage residential portfolio. And then on the wholesale side and commercial side we expect to see growth throughout that period. John highlighted some of the idiosyncratic reasons why we saw some decline this year. But our expectation is going to continue to grow. Having said all that, the reason we became the largest lender in this country is because we look at the market, we look at our customer demand and we want to make sure we are making good, long-term credit decision. So sometimes in a quarter it means you grow, sometimes you shrink but over the long term we are very confident we are going to be able to continue to grow. ", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. And then if I could just dig in on the commercial business specifically. The biggest of the loan buckets on the wholesale side. Even maybe some granularity there in terms of -- I know the specifics that John mentioned but obviously C&I had slowed overall and what do you just seeing in terms of customer demand and where that growth would come from inside that commercial business ?", "Tim Sloan", "Oh I think again we called out some specifics for example in this quarter we had a number of larger CRE construction loans that paid off and that's again that's going to be little bit episodic but overall view is that we are going to see growth across the entire portfolio again because we are in so many businesses, each business is going to have a little bit different complexion in the quarter. We highlighted the fact that because of the GE Capital acquisition we are now the number one asset base lender and we are pretty excited about that. That hasn't necessary happened over last few years so there is -- we think there is good upside there but really across the board we are optimistic about being able to grow. ", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, got it. And on the flip side just if I can ask the question about your credit in general and you are kind of got to this point where your charge-off bounced up a little bit and you didn't really release for the first time in a while. There is a lot of moving parts and you mentioned the hurricane impact. But just can you just talk about outlook or any credit normalization going forward in terms of also the mix and just amount of recovery that you are still being continuing to see on the commercial side?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, Ken, it's a really good question. I think that everybody in the industry and certainly been for us too, we've seen such a benign credit environment except for the energy business which we've all work through. Whether you are a 27 basis points or 30 or 33 whatever the number is over the last few quarter it's still really low. If you overlay the current economic environment we continue to believe that losses will probably bounce around at lower rate ex things like the impact from the hurricanes but overall the portfolio has never been in any better shape in my 30 years at the company so we continue to be optimistic. Sorry John -- ", "John Shrewsberry", "I think for us auto will look better because we've taken out the low end of credit quality. ", "Tim Sloan", "It's good point.", "John Shrewsberry", "Vintages a recent quarterly, vintages of origination. I think with card we've been adding more new cards. We -- our card portfolio is now probably 50% what you consider to be very seasoned vintages so we should probably see a tick up because newer card vintages are going to experience front end loaded losses that's to be expected. ", "Tim Sloan", "But again that's not necessarily because of any fundamental deterioration at card portfolio, that's just a natural aging of new customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the lines of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Pleas go ahead.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, good morning. I had a couple of quick questions. One was on the hedge accounting treatment that you said you are going to adopt next quarter. Could you give us a sense to why you decided to adopt that? And could you also go through what do you think the impact is on balance sheet or you are going to be realizing any gains as you move over securities et cetera?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. So this is -- this really relates to our own liabilities. When we issue long-term fixed rate either in dollars or in other currencies we hedge -- we often hedge back to floating, and we almost -- we generally hedge back to dollars or at least historically we did. So is that accounting noise that gets reduced as a result of the new accounting. So the only real impact that you are going to see is there will be some catch-up adjustment, year-to-date adjustment in Q4 which I think might amount to call it $100 million - $200 million kind of range. We haven't finished all the map on that yet but we'll figure out and that will come through in Q4. And then going forward what you see is a lot less volatility and the reason of course we are adopting it is because we are creating this noise in non-interest income that was bouncing around to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter that was just as a result of different evaluation schemes for the liability lag and the hedge lag and things that were permanently hedged. So we are happy with this kind of change. ", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And I heard in that there is one time opportunity to move some securities from held for -- held to maturity to AFS. I just wondering if you are going to take advantage of that at all or not?", "John Shrewsberry", "Not going to. The impact for us is really on the liability side. ", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, got it. And then question on the living will and living will have been extended right to next one is not for another was it 18 months or so. Just want to understand how you are thinking about that? Because I know we had a conversation before round how you are thinking about the size of the investment bank versus the living will and maybe you can give some updated thoughts on that. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. So the MPOE strategy that we've had in our recently filings works great for us. And I point out that because it's more unique to us among the larger banks because we've got smaller non bank affiliate activity going on and that's sort of a key driver of whether that works or doesn't work. In order to create more flexibility going forward including more either size or complexity of some of our non bank affiliate activity with nothing in particular or urgent in mind but just in general. We get more flexibility with an SPOE strategy. We had to sort of finish the process first of satisfying the deficiencies that were called out a couple of years ago and then filing the most recent plan. And so we stuck to our plan and delivered that and the feedback thus far has been -- it's not complete but it has been fine. So by doing this we think we open up more flexibility for Wells Fargo going forward and as you mentioned the industry got word that there will be instead of an annual cycle, at least this time an extra year and so whether we wait and file at the end of that period or we file at the middle of that period, we haven't really figured out yet but the intention is to move towards SPOE and we thought that the investment community should know that. ", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. Just on auto specifically. I know you mentioned your actions you would be taking in the auto portfolio. What would drive you to get back into growth mode there? I know there has been some chatter around demand picking up and obviously the hurricane has had some impact. ", "Tim Sloan", "Yes. I just add I think there are two things going on, Betsy. One, there is the execution of the fundamental changes that we are making in the auto business to make it much more efficient and much more -- much less complex. And then it's just going to be our view of what's going on in the business. And if we think that there is more opportunity from a risk-reward standpoint as it relates to credit and we will take advantage of that but I think the decisions we've made over the last year had really worked because when you look at the average FICO scores of our customers, we did now increase and that's exactly what we wanted. So it's going to be a function of the changes that we are making in the business and then our view of what's going on in the industry. Even said all that I think you should expect that portfolio -- I am not being negative I just want to make sure you reinforce the comment I made to Ken, you should expect the portfolio even if we turn things up a notch to continue to decline through the fourth quarter this year through most of the next year and probably bottom out again sometime hopefully at the second half of next year. I mean we like that business. Don't get us wrong and our expectation is over time we will continue to gain share in that business but right now we are cautious and we got lot of changes going into the business and we got to execute those. ", "John Shrewsberry", "And those changes which we talked about are taking 50 or 55 distributed origination underwriting and collecting centers down to three bigger regional centers. And so while that's happening we rather have a higher credit profile the average customer so just that we are dealing with fewer defaults frankly while we make that change. And it will be made in 2018.", "Betsy Graseck", "Right. And so that you get down to the 3 by the end of 2018 or is that 2019?", "John Shrewsberry", "It's happening now; it should be by the end of 2018, Betsy. ", "Betsy Graseck", "And then just lastly on the reserve built for hurricanes $450 million is that right? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. And it's not net build -- it's -- we would have it released but for the analysis that we've done so far on the hurricane impact areas. ", "Betsy Graseck", "Right. And is that -- it's a little figure that we've seen in other folks, can you just give us a sense of exposures or what's include in that? Is that across all credit spectrum, consumer and corporate? Is there anything that's really driving the bus on the size? ", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, it is. Betsy, again we are the largest lender in the country and you had a significant hurricanes have affected to very fast growing estate Texas and Florida in particular. ", "John Shrewsberry", "And Puerto Rico", "Tim Sloan", "And Puerto Rico and so it's across all product types. But I would also put in the category of if it's early in our assessment and I think we've been appropriately prudent in wanting to be conservative. We could end up being a little bit too conservative, maybe a little bit less but right now because there is so much going on in all those markets we just thought it was prudent not to have a release until we get to the bottom or whatever the exposure would be. And our folks have been working very hard in terms of trying to get their arms around it and everyday is a little bit different. My guess we'll have updates throughout the quarter.", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. One of the first things we did in Texas and Florida was offer people a 90 day forbearance on their mortgage payment then add them on to the back end of the loan with no negative repercussions so they get just get their feet back on the ground. That's great thing although it is just complicate figuring out whose going to make their payments or not. So we have to wait I suppose just seeing all the information and every first of the month payment cycle. We also have more complications here with our borrower insurance whether it's auto insurance or homeowner insurance, how are they covered for flood, how are they covered for winds, those types of things which will -- which increases the uncertainty on what performance are going to be. So we noticed also that there was a bigger number than what some other people have talked about. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.", "Scott Siefers", "Hi, guys. I was wondering if you could spend just a moment or two talking about the branch footprint overall? I mean you guys definitely been more aggressive recently than you had been over say the last several years and sort of pairing back where appropriate but I guess increasingly I am finding myself getting questions about why your branch footprint shouldn't be like 1,000 or so branches, if you are just given how many more branches you have been -- the other biggest players in the country so just curious if you could maybe offer a little color on sort of how you are thinking about the appropriateness of the footprint as look you forward and what any additional opportunities might be?", "Tim Sloan", "Sure. So Scott I think it's a great question but fundamentally I think every institutions going to have a different footprint. We are really, really proud of this footprint that we've developed over decades and decades which is one of the reasons why we have the largest market share from the deposit standpoint. That's incredibly valuable. And I'd also just caution that it's not just about the number of branches, it is the size of the branches, it's how they are organized, it's where they are located, which drive cost and so on. But I think Mary Mack was very clear in our Investor Day in giving a couple of years of guidance in terms of what are plans are and we are in the midst to executing on those plans. So far this year as we've detailed we are on track in terms of the branches we are closing. We haven't seen in any significant revenue impact which is part of the goal too. Most of our team members that were in those branches have now liked other branches which are absolutely terrific. So we've got an experienced crew. My guess is that over time we'll continue to respond to our customers because they are going to ultimately tell us how many branches they want. We transaction billions of dollars, billions of interactions each quarter but over 50 millions time a month somebody still comes into our branches and they want to be able to use them. So I think it's likely over time the number of branches that you see will decline. If our customers tell us that they want fewer of them then we will accelerate that. But candidly, if our customers tell us they want more we are going to listen to them. But I think you had also seen Scott the impact from the investment that we are making from the digital standpoint and it's not just the investment in terms of opening new accounts, it's also how we are integrating that into the branch experience. So it's long-winded answer to your question we are going to execute on what we said for 2018 and 2019. We are going to have an Investor Day next May. We will provide you with an update. I am sorry 2017 and 2018, we will have Investor Day next May, we will provide you with some updates and we will continue to move forward. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Only thing I'd is that we are thinking very, very aggressively about what the right mix is. We own half of our branches. We have short leases on most of the other half. We are in a position to be as flexible as we need to be if we think opportunity presents itself.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ", "John Pancari", "Good morning. Just wanted to -- sorry to everybody here but I just want to kick the dead horse on loan growth one more time. And I'll be quick on this one but the way we should think about with loan growth and the potential impact of the sales practice in card and auto insurance issues that if those issues did not happen at all. If you never had the sale practice issue emerge nor the auto insurance gap, CPI issue and all that. Loan growth headwind that you are seeing rights now, this decline in commercial et cetera that still would have happened? ", "John Shrewsberry", "For commercial", "John Pancari", "Yes", "Tim Sloan", "Yes. John, the sales practices impact for our loan growth has been primarily based on referrals from our branches to some of our other businesses. So there has been impact in terms of credit card referrals and first mortgage home equity and things like that. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Personal loans", "Tim Sloan", "And personal and lines, thank you John. That's really where the impact has been. There has not been material impact in wholesale or wealth and investment management for that matter. ", "John Pancari", "Okay, thank you. And then a couple quick more things on the slide 16 where you give us the targeted savings exclude those items there including the CDI and the FDIC. What is the total of those items? Is it about a $1 billion?", "John Shrewsberry", "On an annual basis it is about $1 billion, yes. ", "John Pancari", "Okay, all right, great. And then lastly on the credit side the 90 plus days past dues up 14% on a linked quarter basis. I am sorry if I missed this but how much of that is storm related and what is the amount that maybe related to the storms I guess and could that increase from here. Thanks. ", "Tim Sloan", "I don't have a good answer for you, John. I don't think much because it just happened and so I don't think that's a big driver. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ", "Matt O'Connor", "Good morning. Tim, so you have been CEO now for about a year ", "Tim Sloan", "A year and a day I think. ", "Matt O'Connor", "All right that even -- ", "Tim Sloan", "Maybe two I don't know, yes, seems like forever, Matt.", "Matt O'Connor", "So now that you've been there for sometime do you feel like you have identified all the issues related to just call it sales practices and tactics have become headline issue for the stock and obviously weighted on results as well, issues like you have identified those issues. ", "Tim Sloan", "Well, Matt, we've been working very hard to identify all the issues. I am very pleased with the progress obviously, I am not necessarily pleased if you had find something, it sometimes it's not particularly positive but we've made a commitment to look through everything and be very disclosive and I appreciate that can create a headline. And weigh on the company and stock and team members and others stakeholders. But we've made a lot of progress. I can't commit to you Matt that we've finished everything because things are still in progress but we are very far along but I think it's also important to reinforce -- our review of all of our policies, procedures, practices is going to continue for a long time meaning that we got to continue to ask more of ourselves everyday. And I think that was in hindsight one of the mistakes that we made and we've -- I have taken responsibility for that, we've taken responsibility for it. But it's long-winded answer to your question, we are making a lot of progress. We've been transparent about everything that we've talked about, we discovered and so on. I am really pleased with the progress. ", "Matt O'Connor", "And if you had to guess I mean how much longer until you can say we've look through everything, this is what we found, we are done and I kind of appreciate that so issues can pop-up at any company at any time but when you kind of put the stake on the ground and say, we've been through everything, it's a big company, lots of businesses, lots of employees and we are moving forward and I kind of 100% guarantee nothing will pop up but like we are essentially on par with everybody else and we are feeling good from here. How long that is going to take? ", "Tim Sloan", "Well, Matt, I don't ever want to be on par with everybody else. I want to be better than everybody else. And that's why we rolled out our six aspirational goals for our team in March. And we said, look, we want to be the best in the industry. We are not in the best in the industry and everyone of those right now but that's what our goal is. So listen I appreciate the question and I understand the reason for the question and so on. But I don't have a specific date and I think it's a mistake notwithstanding in the short term that might feel good but in long term it would be a mistake, it's a mistake to put a stake in the ground, and say everything is got to be done by certain day because then what happen is people might rush to get to an answer and I don't want them to rush to the answer. I want them to get to the right answer. But again we've made a lot of progress. As John described, we are spending a lot of money looking through everything and building a better company. So we are going to continue on that journey. ", "Matt O'Connor", "Okay. I can appreciate it's hard to put a timeframe on it but I do think it's important to come out when you feel confident and say that these legacy issues have been addressed, we are turning the page and we are moving on. ", "Tim Sloan", "Understood.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks for taking the question. Hey, what I want to focus on is your deposit beta has been higher than the peer which is a normal compared to your history. And that is really been I think reflective of you wanting to especially with corporate and wealth management customers not giving any other reasons in this period to work anywhere else. So you have been defensive in your deposit pricing which is not been the case in the past you have been much more offensive and aggressive being able to hold back those deposits. When you look at your assets structure because of the duration that would have had you to assume on your deposit side over time, you would have extended your asset. So what you are kind of getting is a fundamental shift into deposit beta which doesn\u2019t reflect on your asset side so you got almost a mismatch and I am just wondering if that's the way to kind of think about this and is this how and why we are not seeing the margin expansion that we are seeing in some other banks. ", "John Shrewsberry", "The aggregate deposit beta is a function of the component pieces of it. And as I mentioned earlier we are the number one retail deposit franchise and beta there is essentially zero. And in wealth and investment management where we've got a sophisticated clientele with lot of excess liquidity and lot of options, I think our beta -- our realized beta has been on the order of a third -- 30% to 35%. In the wholesale where we as you point out we have lots of sophistication, lots of competition et cetera, I think the realized beta has been something on the order of two thirds and so to the extent that we've been growing wholesale deposits a little bit faster than the weighted average deposit beta moves up reflecting that mix. I don't know whether Perry would say that he is being responsive in this cycle to give not give people a reason to move money away from Wells Fargo. I think they are being judicious; they are going customer by customer or customer category by customer category. We are doing more for example with certain type of institutional borrowers which probably have the most sensitivity to change in rate but we need them for our total liquidity profile and it sort of is what it is on average. And when I think about NIM expansion and the rising rate environment, obviously this is a big part of the outcome but it's also the change in rest of our liability structure as well, we've got more long -term debt than we've ever had before that comes in more of cost which has been NIM depressing during the time that we've been adding an office, this few other structural items as well. ", "Tim Sloan", "Marty, let me just reinforce how we think about pricing, deposits for our wholesale customers. It's very much based -- very much done on a relationship by relationship basis. So it's not just about hey let's decide whether or not we want to keep these deposits, it's about what's the value of the overall relationship. And so it's as you appreciated it's a little bit more complicated than just the deposit. It's the relationship and it's very much coordinated with what we are doing on the wealth and the individual side. So there is a lot of coordination going on, if there has as John mentioned the beta is a little bit higher but I wouldn't necessary jump to the conclusion that's fundamentally changed the structure at the company. ", "Marty Mosby", "Now I thinking that might be temporary in the sense that you used to be able to most aggressive lagger which helped you to be able to expand when everybody else was expanding but also maintain a higher margin because you had extended the duration on your assets prudently so that defended your margin in a decline rate environment but takes away a little bit of the punch in the way up that you used to be able to make by just being half of what everybody else did in deposit increases. Then my last question was if you look at fee income, you've seen disruption of activities related to these hurricanes and other things that have go on in the last couple of months. Do you feel like -- we've seen what you have allocated on the loan loss reserve, but hasn't it also probably impacted some of your fee income in the third quarter. ", "Tim Sloan", "Oh I think at the margin, Marty, there is no question when you have such an important market like Florida without power and still parts of Florida without power, you have an important market like in and around Houston which has been like very dynamic from a growth standpoint, there are some impact. I don't know how much it is but at the margin there is some impact and we'll work through, that has an impact to the company in a very short term, over the long terms those are great markets, they are going to recover. Generally, what you see kind of post hurricane, in a hurricane situation you see kind of V shape recovery in those markets and we are looking forward to that. That's one of the reasons why we've really focused on making sure that we provided all the benefits to our customers possible to help them recover even faster. ", "Marty Mosby", "No, I think that's right. And this was say it's kind of hidden impact there was no way to put your finger on but it is kind of underneath a numbers as you kind of look at and it will rebound quickly but thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Good morning, Tim. Good, thank you. Can you guys give us some color -- obviously, you're leading mortgage originator in the United States, leading mortgage originator. And can you give us some color on where you see the housing industry at this point in the cycle? Are we halfway through the cycle? 2/3 the way through? We're just turning out? Any color would be helpful.", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, I mean everybody has got an opinion on this. I wish Franklin on the phone because he'd probably give you the best one but my personal view is that I think this recovery is very different than what we've seen historically because of the impacts of demographics and what we just see the millennials forming households and therefore buying houses at a different pace than what we saw in earlier recovery and/or prior recoveries in other demographics. So I think there is -- and we believe there is a lot more room to grow. I don't know what inning it's in but I would say its -- again assuming kind of the steady economic growth that we've seen, we see that demographic grew aging more, they are starting to form families more, we are starting to -- and we are starting to see the benefit of that. So my expectation is that we are early in that process and we got lot to look forward to. And that's one of the reasons why we have been so focused on rolling out our new digital mortgage application because I think particularly for that demographic group, they are used to a mortgage and then they want a mortgage experience and maybe you and I didn't experience when we bought our first home. They are used to --when they go online they want all the information as they should have and so that's why we are excited to roll this out in the first quarter and we think that will be very positive to that demographic group.", "Gerard Cassidy", "In that application you've described, Tim, that's equivalent to the rocket mortgage that Quicken loans has right now?", "Tim Sloan", "I want to be respectful to the Quicken, I think they've done a great job with rocket mortgage but I would describe what we are doing as the kind of the next generation because it's not just about giving a fast answer. That's part of it. Everybody expects that and we are doing that across the platform from a consumer side. This is about if you are going online, you are Wells Fargo customer, you type in a little bit information like who you are and you want to mortgage and we pre populate your application so that you are not -- we are not asking you and you are not having to give for the 44 time where you live, how much you make and it's using the trusted data that we have here. What's even more exciting about that is that we are going to have the capability of pulling that data from outside Wells Fargo too. So we are going to have that same capability both inside and outside of Wells Fargo. So I would describe that is a next generation. ", "John Shrewsberry", "So I mentioned in my comments earlier that data modernization is one of our big initiatives because for reasons like this with the breadth of reach that we have to call it 21 million households and 70 million customers in one way or another, we know so much about our customers that we should be able to as in this case pre populate with trusted data, but present really customized, really personalized solution when people are looking for a new product or new service. We can use that same data in a fraud protection way, it's very, very, powerful and a risk management way, it's very, very powerful. The more we know because of the breadth of our relationship with customers, the stronger the value proposition is going forward. So it's a huge initiative and it's going to -- it should change the way retail banking is done. ", "Gerard Cassidy", "I see. And maybe Tim, sticking with home mortgage for a moment, I think, very recently, the mortgage bankers association came up with the top 20 originators. And what's fascinating is the top 10, the number of non-banks that are in there, like the Quicken loans or Freedom Mortgage Corp., and they're growing very rapidly. How do you see them as a competitive threat to the traditional banks like your own?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, I think the primary driver for the change in mix in the top 10 has been related to FHA direct mortgages again set correspondent aside for a minute. Because the FHA has not adopted the same liability structure that Fannie and Freddie have. The larger originators we would be one and our other bank competitors or the other have just said you know what we are not going to sign up for the fact that 10 years from now somebody could come back and say I mortgage the originated today defaulted at that point in time. That's really been the driver. Now I am hopeful that with all the changes we are going to incur as we look at how homes are financed in this country that issue will be dealt with and I can assure you that if and when that occurs we will back into FHA direct business and you will see an improvement in our share over time. But that's been the driver. Plain and simple. And I don't mean to be negative about any other competitors. They are all terrific and I am sure they are providing good service and so on to their customers but that's been the driver. ", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. And then with home equity loans, I think you mentioned, if I heard you correctly a moment ago, that you could see growth in the product in 2018, but the vintage home equity loans are performing much better than your earlier thought. Is there any possibility that, that type of product whether it was an interest only product for a 10-year term, would those come back when you think about growing the portfolio since they performed so much better than expected.", "Tim Sloan", "There is no question that we want to try to retain as many of those customers as we can. So the short answer is yes, I think that's part of our overall growth strategy but many of those are just paying off because the customers don't need them any more. ", "Gerard Cassidy", "I see. And then just lastly, you guys talked about your expense initiative, of course, and it's $4 billion that you're going to reduce, I think you, John, pretty clear, that the expectations for the reduction in expenses do not include the core deposit premiums that you've been running every year, also the FDIC special assessment and then also expenses associated with businesses that you sold of. Can you frame up for us what that total could be from those 3 areas and that it will be on top of the $4 billion?", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, I think Betsy had asked about the sum of the FDIC premium and the amortization of deposits intangible. That's about $1 billion a year in full run rate. And the expenses from the businesses that we are selling, I don't think that we have called that out one yet, it's less than $1 billion but there is a portion of that's direct and a portion indirect and so we need to make sure that we can drive out all of the indirect that's associated with it in order to take the full amount out. We will get some more clarity as those businesses actually close and are sold. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes. Let's get the deal and then we will provide some more detail. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Saul Martinez", "Hi, good morning, everybody. Two questions. First, client customer growth, your primary checking account customers have essentially been flat over the last year, that compares to sort of mid to high single digit historically and it's really decelerated since second quarter of last year. And on top of that small business account deposit and consumer deposits have been come in as well. So I mean how important is it to stem that and start to drive some consumer account growth and what you need to do to kick start that? Is it at some point does it suggest that maybe you do have to start to become a little bit more aggressive in terms of deposit pricing on the retail side as well? ", "Tim Sloan", "So let me answer the last question, last part of your question and get to the beginning because it's a really good question. The short answer is no. We don't -- that the driver this is not deposits pricing. I think that at the margin if you are competing on price, you are making short term decision and invest in the opportunity to build long term relationships. What -- how I would think about the primary checking account growth in kind of two parts. One is quality and one is quantity. You are talking about quantity which is an absolute fair point year-over-year it's been flat. I think the reason for that is because we've been through and are going through a transformation in our retail business. And when you think about what -- how that sales practices settlement and related reputational impact affected our team and our customers particularly in the third and the fourth quarter, and then Mary and team have been making fundamental changes to the business in terms of a new incentive plan, going through reducing a layer of management in terms of new training and just there has been so much going on. And I think that what we are seeing and actually I was talking to Mary about this over the last couple of days. What we are seeing right now in our branches our team members that are so much more confident and working so much better with their customers to provide them with solutions and I think you are going to see that in not only continued improvement in customer experience and loyalty scores but you are going to see that in terms of growth. The quality I think is an important point. Mary highlighted at Investor Day that average customer deposits per account were up about 8% year-over-year, now we are seeing that be up about 11%. So we've got work to do on quantity, quality is already improving but it's just the execution of all the plans that are in the process right now. And we are seeing improvement everyday. ", "Saul Martinez", "Okay. No, that's helpful. I guess a follow up with sort of a bigger picture type of question and you guys have lot of stakeholders as any banker any company, employees, the community, you serve your client, your shareholders, you obviously want to be seen as good corporate citizen whose actions are doing good for society at large. But sort of in the grand scheme of things I mean how important is generating an 11% to 13% ROE for shareholders. And the question isn't meant to be confrontational or grandstanding in anyways but it does feel like it sort in the background of discussions you have with investors as well going to pull the cost leverage harder as they can or they going to communicate that or they are going to be more up to change pricing or increase deposit pricing or whatever it is. But I kind of wanted to just ask sort of how do you think about the push and pull of how you run the business and decide how to address different stakeholders' interest? ", "Tim Sloan", "Yes. I will start and then I am sure John want to jump in but look we appreciate that we have lot of stakeholders. And it is not lost on us, that one of our most important stakeholders are you; our shareholders and we have historically provided exceptional returns on an absolute and relative basis. I think our returns are continued to be very, very good. Others have caught up, we appreciate that but make no mistake, we understand that increasing our capital return to our shareholders like we did this quarter where we were up to $4 billion and continuing to grow ROE is very important. And that's one of the reasons why when we introduced our six aspirational goals to our team that we were very clear that providing the best long-term returns to our shareholders and the industry is one of our goals. And we are going to achieve that goal. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ", "Vivek Juneja", "Hi, John. Just a couple of questions, mortgage application issue that came out you said you are refunding customer from September 2016. Just want to understand does something changed in the system that caused this thing to start from September 2016? Any color on that what happened that it starts on that point? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. So prior to 2013, we were in the midst of refinancing boom and everybody was so busy, everybody in the industry but we certainly were that we didn't charge for any sort of rate lock extension. We put a new policy and practice in place at that point which was in place until we changed it. So it's that roughly three year timeframe that we are focused on where some customers where we charged a rate lock extension maybe should have been -- it should have been handled differently and that's population that we were focused on. We changed our practice, it's done centrally now and so that's there is a focus. ", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. And so I guess brings a bigger picture question. So with all these kind of little, little things that have come up which not always easy to find, is that something you are trying to do to I mean it is a big bank in terms of processes so that you can catch more of these, Tim?", "Tim Sloan", "Oh, absolutely. I think that's really been fundamental to the changes that we've been executing on in the last year. We are very clear about the fact that one of the reasons that we had some issues in our retail banking business is because of how we were organized. So we've centralized all of our control functions whether its compliance or HR, finance, you name it. And so we've got a better check in balance than we did before. That's number one. Two, we've been very focused on reinforcing to the entire team that if there is something they are concerned about, go ahead and raise your hand and escalate it and so that's working too. And then within our centralized risk functions we are also -- we've also created a conduct office and within that we are assembling data to John's point about the investment we are making at data. So that we are using data better to triangulate into any area that we are concerned about. You take call to an FX line or attrition or complaints or whatever, you put that altogether and then you can more quickly look at something and say, hey, we got an issue, we don't. The good news is we are making lots of progress but absolutely right. I mean we have fundamentally changed this organization. We fundamentally changed it for the better and we are seeing that everyday. Now, sometimes in seeing that it means that we find something. We are going to be very transparent about it because that's what we promised you to do. ", "Vivek Juneja", "So even things like product pricing, Tim? Product pricing - ", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, oh sure. ", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. Different question. John, you mentioned something about spending on BSA AML; I haven't heard that from you before. Something new I mean is there an order or event or something that caused you to mention that or any color on that? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Nothing new. There has been an order in place for sometime which just raises the standard for the level of borrower due diligence if necessary in order to be satisfying from a regulatory perspective. So there is a lot of beneficial owner or if there is a lot of sort of incremental memo writing, file cracking et cetera across hundreds and hundreds of thousands of wholesale customers. And it cost at the margin hundreds and millions of dollars per year to accomplish. That sort of a backlog issue. ", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. And when do you expect you might be able to get out of this consent order? ", "John Shrewsberry", "Well, I think the expectation is that the work necessary to deliver would be done -- finished in 2018. It has been underway for more than a year. That's a different question as to getting under the consent order. ", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Hi, good morning. So yes two quick questions I think. When you look at the C&I growth, I know it's down, I know you highlighted some of the decline and some of -- what was offset by growth in the presentation but that still only accounts for $1 billion of the $3 billion decline. So can you just highlight where the rest of the decline came from? And in light of some of your peers were reporting strong growth in large corporate banking, how would that large corporate banking perform on a quarter? ", "Tim Sloan", "Large corporate was down, I don't have the specific number in front of me but it was down a bit. I would say was probably in line with what I have seen from some of our competitors. It was just a little bit decline or low in some of the larger transactional activity. But we called out these specific areas that were the primary drivers. Everything else was relatively small and we also called out the impact in terms of the commercial real estate.", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Okay. And then on the facility ratio for 2018, I know you hear -- you have been saying that your whole to lending growth picks up and that you are optimistic it will but being what kind of lending growth is in the budget for you hit that 59%? I mean can you just still hit the 59% goal with 1% loan growth or 2% loan growth? ", "Tim Sloan", "We haven't exactly send a budget for next year yet but look our assumption is that we are going -- and belief is that we are going to be able to grow our commercial loans as we have year-over-year-over-year, I mean we had some impact us so far in the last couple of quarters. But I wouldn't describe that as the primary driver for what's going to happen from the efficiency standpoint because we've got a consumer loan portfolio and we've got revenues coming from our fees and like. So it's a little bit more complicated than that in terms of the driver or the efficiency. But again our goal is to get down to a 59% level sometime next year. So I am sure we'll be talking about that again. ", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Okay, thanks. ", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you. Listen, I really appreciate everybody's time this morning. I know it's been a busy morning for all of you. Just want to reemphasis that over the past years we've made a number of fundamental changes to our business model, to structure the organization which I was just mentioning and to a number of our performance management programs to ensure that we are focusing on our customers and focusing on their financial needs. Again, I want to thank the hard work and effort of our 268,000 team members for their focus and resiliency in meeting those customers' need. We are seeking every opportunity to identify and fix any issues that we have with the company. And make sure they are done correctly. As I mentioned, we've seen a very strong progress in addressing those issues and also rebuilding trust with all of stakeholders including all of you. And while we understand there is more work to do, I am confident that we are absolutely on the right path as we continue to build a better, stronger Wells Fargo. So again thank you very much for your time. Have a good day. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. ", "I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.", "John Campbell", "Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.", "I will now turn our call over to CEO and President, Tim Sloan.", "Tim Sloan", "Thank you, John. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2017 was a transformational year for Wells Fargo as we made significant progress on our efforts to build a better bank. Our vision of satisfying our customers' financial needs remains unchanged, but how we execute this vision has evolved. ", "This evolution includes develop new ways to more efficiently serve our customers and create a better customer experience, which includes investments in innovation, streamlining and centralizing processes in organization structures, strengthening the foundations of the way we manage risk and building a robust and more modern data and technology infrastructure. ", "Pages we supplement highlight the few of the actions we taken at Wells Fargo better for our customers, our team members, our shareholder and our communities. Some with our customers in order to help those impacted by hurricanes last year we provide a payment relief and proactively way -- to approximately 100,000 customers. We've also made a number of customer friendly changes to help all of our customers to better manage their accounts. For example, in March we introduced Automatic zero balance alerts and we now send over 18 million real time alerts a month, enabling our customers to make a deposit or a transfer so they don't overdraw their account. ", "In November, we introduced Overdraft Rewind, which has already helped over 350,000 customers avoid overdraft charges. We believe that using data and technology to help our customers better manage their finances will enable us to grow and build more long-term relationships. ", "In 2017, we accelerated the pace of innovation and launched value added technologies, including card-free ATM access, which our customers have used more than 5 million times since March. And since June, our customers have sent more than $10 billion through Zelle for P2P payments. As our customers have increased their use of online and mobile channels, we've made it easier for them to interact with us digitally. For example, digital credit card account openings were up 47% from a year ago. In November, we launched Intuitive Investor, our digital brokerage advisory offering, and later this quarter we will fully rollout our digital mortgage application, which combines the power of Wells Fargo Data with a You Know Me customer experience. ", "In 2018, we expect additional innovations including instant issuance of debit cards to customers in mobile wallets and control tower, a central hub for customers to view and manage the places where their Wells Fargo cards and account information is stored. ", "In addition to these innovations, we rely on our team members to help drive an exceptional customer experience and in 2017 we took a number of steps to enhance team member benefits, including adding four additional paid holidays, announcing plans to grant restricted stock rights to approximately 250,000 team members, and increasing the minimum base pay for all U.S. based team members. We increased the minimum hourly rate, to $13.50 in 2017 which impacted 31,000 team members. After the passage of the tax cuts and Job Act, we announced another increase to $15 an hour starting in March 2018 and we are also reviewing team members, who were already making $15 an hour or slightly above to ensure that they are paid appropriately based on their role. We estimate that approximately 70,000 team members will receive a pay increase related to these changes. ", "Our goal is to deliver long-term value for our shareholders through a balanced business model, strong risk discipline, efficient execution and a world-class team. In 2017, we generated $22.2 billion of net income, with an 11.35% return on equity. From that, we've returned $14.5 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. This is up 16% from 2016. Returning more capital to our shareholders remains a top priority. ", "Another goal is to make positive contributions to the communities we serve. And in 2017, we donated $286 million including more than $4 million to areas that were impacted by Hurricanes, California wildfires and other natural disasters. We also announced that we are targeting $400 million in donations to non-profits and community organizations in 2018, an increase of approximately 40% from last year. And beginning in 2019, we are targeting 2% of our after-tax net profits for corporate philanthropy. ", "Our results in the fourth quarter were strong and they included a net benefit from the tax cuts and Job Act. While it's too early to determine the full impact, it appears that tax reform will benefit our customers and help grow the U.S. economy and surveys indicate business confidence has increased. Other items that impacted our results in the fourth quarter included, the gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, and higher litigation accruals. ", "Our efforts to transform Wells Fargo were evident in our results in 2017, including record deposit balances, improved retail banking household retention, increased brand satisfaction with most recent visit scores, which are now back to the levels we had prior to the sales practice settlements, growth in debit card and credit card purchase volume, both up 6% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, record levels of client assets in wealth and investment management, historically low credit losses, exceptionally strong capital and liquidity levels. And while our expenses increased driven by higher litigation accruals and investments in our businesses and capabilities, we are on track with our expense initiatives and we remain committed to our target of $4 billion in expense reductions. John will provide more details on this later in the call.", "In summary, Wells Fargo is a much better company today than we were a year ago. And notwithstanding our challenges, I am confident that the hard work, dedication and resiliency of our team members demonstrated throughout 2017 will make Wells Fargo even better in 2018 as we continue our transformation. ", "John will now discuss our financial results in more detail.", "John Shrewsberry", "Thanks, Tim. And good morning, everyone. We are earned $6.2 billion or $1.16 per share in the fourth quarter. And as Tim mentioned our results included three noteworthy items I will describe in a minute. First, I want to quickly highlight the impact from our election to early adopt the new hedge accounting standard which was mentioned on the call last quarter and was discussed in our third quarter 10-Q filing. It\u2019s described in a note on slides that highlights, slide 4. As a result of this early adoption, our previously reported EPS for prior quarters in 2017 was revised resulting in a net $0.03 per share increase in EPS for the first nine months of the year. We have more information on this accounting standard in the appendix. ", "On page 5, we summarize the noteworthy items which included a $3.35 billion after-tax benefit or $0.67 per share from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I will be providing more details about this on the next page. Our results also include an $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services which benefited EPS by $0.11, and we had a $3.25 billion litigation accrual in the quarter for a variety of matters including mortgage related regulatory investigations, sales practices and other consumer related matters. The majority of this expense was not tax deductible and it reduced EPS by $0.59.", "On page 6, we provide more details on the impacts of the Tax Act. The estimated tax benefit from the reduction to net deferred income taxes was $3.89 billion, was somewhat unique in that the tax effective, our temporary difference results in a net deferred tax liability which is primarily driven by differences between the book and tax treatment of our leasing and mortgage servicing businesses and mark-to-market timing differences. ", "In addition, we\u2019ve not had big historic net operating losses which are now less valuable under the Tax Act and we earn substantially all of our income in the US, so we have lower amounts of foreign cash subject to deemed repatriation. This benefit was partially offset by a $370 million after-tax loss from valuation adjustments related to leverage leases, low income housing and tax advantage renewable energy investments. ", "In addition, there was a $173 million tax expense from the estimated deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. We currently expect our full year 2018 effective income tax rate to be approximately 19%. ", "And we\u2019ll highlight much of what\u2019s on page 7 later on the call. So, let me just point out on the asset side, we purchased $20.9 billion of securities in the fourth quarter which were largely offset by one-off and sales. ", "On the liability side, our long-term debt balances declined $14.2 billion primarily driven by lower federal home loan bank debt. ", "I'll be highlighting our income statement drivers on page 8 later on the call. So, turning to page9. Average loans declined $521 million from the third quarter with commercial loans down $692 million partially offset by a $171 million of higher average consumer loans. However, we did have some positive momentum in our loan growth during the quarter with period end loans up $4.9 billion from the third quarter. ", "Let me highlight the drivers starting on page 10. Commercial loans increased $3.2 billion from the third quarter, with C&I loans up $5.2 billion. C&I growth was broad based and included seasonal growth in financial institutions and commercial distribution finance as well as growth in asset backed finance and corporate banking. Commercial real estate loans declined $2.1 billion from the third quarter, reflecting our continued credit discipline in a very competitive market. ", "Consumer loans grew $1.7 billion from the third quarter, similar the trends we've highlighted throughout the year. We had growth in first mortgage loans and credit card balances and declines in junior lean mortgages auto and other revolving and installment loans. As a reminder, growth in the first quarter will be impacted by seasonally lower mortgage origination and credit card balances. ", "Auto originations were relatively flat linked quarter and were down 33% from a year ago. We've reduced volumes while strengthening the credit profile of this portfolio and our origination volume with the FICO score above 640 grew to 85% of total originations in the fourth quarter, up from 76% a year ago. We expect balances will continue to decline throughout 2018 given the transformational changes we're making in the business. ", "Our deposits reached a record high in the fourth quarter and our average deposits increased 2% from the year ago. Our average deposit cost increased 2 basis points from the third quarter and was up 16 basis points from a year ago. The market hasn't made changes to the rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits and neither have we. As Fed funds and LIBOR have increased we've had incremental deposit repricing for commercial and wealth and management customers. If the tax act drives stronger, industry loan growth this year, deposit betas could be impacted somewhat as market demand for deposits increases to fund this growth. ", "Our full year 2017 net interest income increased 4% consisting with the expectation we provided at Investor Day. Net interest income in the fourth quarter declined to $136 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by the $183 million reduction to net interest income from adjustments related to leverage leases due to the tax act, which reduced loan yields in the quarter. Similarly, our NIM was down 2 basis points to 284 as the negative impacts from the adjustment related to leverage leases and growth in average deposits was partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest benefit from all other growth repricing and variable terms. ", "Investors often ask us about our loan swaps. So, let me provide some additional details on our position. As we previously disclosed between 2014 and 2016, we entered into received fixed rate swaps to hedge some of our LIBOR based commercial loans when the expectation was the interest rates to be lower for longer. We converted lower yielding floating rate loans into higher yielding fixed rate loans. ", "At the peak, we had $86 million worth of loan swaps. We actively manage these positions as starting in the third quarter, we began to unwind some of them. At year-end, we had $51 million of notional outstanding, and we've unwound more early this year leaving us with that current notional value of closer to $30 million. The reduction in swaps will reduce interest income from these loans in 2018, but it's increased our interest rate sensitivity from the low end, back to near the midpoint of our range of 5 to 15 basis points for a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. ", "Being modestly more asset sensitive at this point in the rate cycle should be beneficial. However, it's important to note, that during the extended period of loan interest rates since these swaps we're entered into they generated incremental revenue of approximately $3 billion for Wells Fargo. The cost of unwinding the swaps which is approximately $700 million will be amortized over the remaining life of the original derivative which averages approximately 3 years. ", "Our net interest income for full year 2018 will be dependent on a variety of factors including the level and of slope of the yield curve as well as deposit betas and earning asset growth trends. ", "Non-interest income grew $337 million from the third quarter. This increase included the benefit of the $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, which was partially offset by a $414 million reduction from impairments on low income housing and renewable energy investments resulting from the tax act. Deposit service charges declined $30 million from the third quarter, driven by customer friendly changes including the launch of Overdraft Rewind in November which Tim highlighted at the start of the call. ", "Trust and investment fees increased $78 million on higher asset base fees and retail brokerage transaction activity. Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $118 million from the third quarter, largely due to a $71 million decline in residential mortgage origination revenue, driven by a 10% reduction in origination volumes primarily from seasonality in the purchase market. The gain on sale margin in the fourth quarter was 125 basis points relatively flat from the third quarter, and based on current pricing trends and channel mix in our held-for-sale pipeline we expect the margin to decline in the first quarter. ", "Servicing income declined $47 million, primarily from lower net hedge results due to the impact of changes in MSR valuation assumptions, including the impact of increasingly competitive industry pricing, lower carry on our MSR hedge in the flatter yield curve environment and increased customer payment deferrals in areas impacted by recent hurricanes. ", "On page 15, we provide details on our trading related revenue, which declined $49 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by declines in customer trading activity from lower volatility and compressed spreads. ", "Turning to expenses on page 16. Expenses increased $2.4 billion from the third quarter largely driven by the $2.2 billion higher operating losses. On page 17, I'll highlight the other drivers of the increase. ", "The $142 million increase from the third quarter in compensation and benefits expense reflected higher stock award expense, primarily from stock price and performance impacts on prior period awards. Higher salaries expense was largely driven by higher costs from the additional paid holidays we granted our team members in 2017. Increases in running the business discretionary and infrastructure cost were driven by typically higher advertising and equipment spending in the quarter. ", "On page 18, we showed the drivers of the year-over-year increase in expenses, which was also primarily driven by higher operating losses. Compensation and benefits expense increased $475 million, primarily due to annual salary adjustments and higher benefit costs which were partially offset by lower FTE. Our FTE were down 2% from the year ago reflecting the sale of our insurance services business as well as declines in consumer lending and community banking. Higher compensation and benefits expense also reflected $115 million of higher deferred comp expense which is P&L neutral. ", "On page 19, we highlight the progress we made in 2017 on our expense initiatives which was primarily driven by the efforts we\u2019ve made through centralization and optimization. We centralized enterprise functions that were previously distributed across our organization. ", "In addition, we realigned businesses to eliminate redundancy and leverage customer synergies and we\u2019ve continued to make transformational changes for our operating models including in-contact centers, technology and operations. ", "We also saved money through continued improvement in vendor leverage in contract pricing. We have done this by using our centralized contract team to negotiate rates based on the aggregated volume of the entire company.", "We reduced travel and entertainment expense by 2% by enhancing our travel policy standards and leveraging technology. We also exceeded our target of 200 branch closures in 2017 and to date, the closures have had minimal impact on household retention and growth. Based on customer channel usage, we currently expect to close 250 branches or more in 2018. Branches play an important part in serving our customers and we will have as many branches as our customers want for as long as they want them. ", "Based on our current assumptions regarding consumer channel behavior and our own technology advances as well as other factors, we can see our total branch network declining to approximately 5,000 by the end of 2020. ", "We are also reducing properties and other businesses including standalone mortgage locations which stand [ph] by over 10% in 2017. We are also transitioning operational activities in our auto business from 57 regional banking centers into three larger regional sites. ", "We expect to complete the consolidation in the first half of 2018 helping us further standardize process in the business. As we pursue these reductions, we will continue to support team members by helping them find other positions while we also consider the banking needs of the communities we serve. ", "We are on track to achieve our targeted $4 billion of expense reductions which have been identified and assigned to the business leaders who have specific responsibility for achieving them. As a reminder the first $2 billion of targeted expense saves by year end 2018 supports our ongoing investment in the businesses which includes a number of key areas such as enhancing our compliance and risk management capability, building a better bank and strengthening our core infrastructure. ", "We expect the additional $2 billion targeted annual expense reductions by the end of 2019 to go to the bottom line and be fully recognized in 2020. These expected savings do not include the completion of core deposit intangible amortization expense at the end of this year which will amount to $769 million in full year 2018 and also it doesn\u2019t include the completion of the FDIC special assessment which we expect should happen by the end of 2018. ", "Finally, it doesn\u2019t include expense savings due to business divestitures which we highlight on page 22. ", "As part of our efforts to be more transparent in response to investor request, we are providing more detail on our expense expectations for 2018 on page 21. We currently expect that full year 2018 total expenses to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion. This expectation includes approximately $600 million of typical operating losses this year and excludes any outside litigation and remediation accruals or penalties. ", "As I mentioned on the call last quarter we expect to achieve a quarterly efficiency ratio with a 59 handle by the end of 2018, not including any outside litigation accruals. ", "2018 revenue which will impact the efficiency ratio will be influenced by a number of factors including the absolute level of rates, the shape of the yield curve, loan growth, deposit betas, credit spreads, cash redeployment and the absolute level of the equity markets. And just as a point of reference, we estimate our efficiency ratio sensitivity to be plus or minus 60 basis points for every 1% increase or decrease in revenue from the $88.4 billion we earned in 2017. We will provide guidance on the expenses for 2019 in our Investor Day in May. ", "For the past couple of years, we\u2019ve been taking a hard look at all of our businesses and their contributions and as a result we\u2019ve had multiple divestitures, we thought it will be helpful to share the revenue and direct expense associated with the businesses we sold over the past two years, which we provide on page 22. As you can see there was a revenue impact from selling these businesses but they were sold for sound economic reasons and generated nice returns for our shareholders. As a reminder, Wells Fargo Insurance Services was sold at the end of November and the share owner services is expected to close later in the first quarter. ", "Turning to our segment starting on slide 23. The majority of the impacts from the tax act as well as the litigation accruals in the quarter were included in our community banking results. ", "On page 24, we highlight the customers continue to actively used their accounts, we have strong growth and digital secure sessions up 8% from a year ago and we continue to have declines in branch and ATM interactions reflecting the increased use of digital channels by our customers. ", "On page 25, we highlight balance and activity growth which included an increase of 6% in both credit and debit card purchase volume from a year ago. As Tim mentioned, branch satisfaction with most recent visit scores are now back to the levels we had prior to the sales practice settlements. I believe the transformational changes we\u2019re making to better meet our customers financial needs including providing bankers with innovative tools to enable more meaningful financial conversations with our customers not only improves customer service, but will also drive growth. ", "Turning to page 26. Wholesale banking results in the fourth quarter included the gain on the sale of our insurance services business. Total wealth and investment management client assets reached a record high of $1.9 trillion, and average closed referral investment assets were up 12% from a year ago. ", "Turning to page 28. Our credit quality remained exceptionally strong, our loss rate for the full year was among the lowest in our history and in the fourth quarter our loss rate was 31 basis points of average loans. All of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position in the quarter including our home equity portfolio. Non-performing assets have declined for seven consecutive quarters and were less than 1% of total loans for the second consecutive quarter. Continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio have benefited this trend. ", "During the oil and gas cycle over the last three years, we established a peak oil and gas reserve of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016 and incurred through the cycle losses of $1.2 billion. We believe we\u2019ve largely put this issue behind us and we\u2019ll no longer provide credit updates on this portfolio in future quarters unless factors change, but we will continue to include the size of the portfolio in our 10-Q, filings. We had a $100 million reserve release in the quarter reflecting continued strong credit performance. ", "Turning to page 29, our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in increased to 11.9% in the fourth quarter remaining well above our internal target level of 10%. We remain focused on returning more capital to shareholders and we turn to record $14.5 billion through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in 2017, up 16% from 2016. We had net share repurchases of $6.8 billion in 2017, up 42% from 2016, and period end common shares outstanding declined 2% to 4.9 billion shares. ", "In summary, we began 2018 with an exceptionally strong asset quality, liquidity and capital. We're on track to achieve our expense targets and the transformational changes we're making throughout Wells Fargo will help us achieve our six goals and drive our long-term success. ", "We'll now take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ", "Erika Najarian ", "So, I expect you to differ me to Investor Day, but I'm going to try anyway. I'm sure that your investors are going to refine your 2019 and 2020 outlook for the company following your results. And if you think about your new guidance for dollar expenses in 2018 and again fully acknowledging that you will get more color in May, is it fair to take that $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion range, assume a growth rate, and this is for 2020, assuming normal growth rate over the next two years and then take out the $2 billion in cost savings, the $769 million in CDI expense and the $573 million in sold business expense, isn't included?", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah. Erika, I think that's a fair description of what could happen. I think one of the big impacts to that could be what revenues look like in 2020, but I think that's fair. ", "John Shrewsberry", "The one thing I'd add that will be, we've been talking about, we'll talk about more at Investor Day as you mentioned, is the arc of the ongoing reinvestment or investment in the various programs that we have to transform Wells Fargo. Some of them are regulatory in nature, some of them are [probation] in nature, but there are variety of them, each of them has their own arc. They're in place today and so how they come off the total is going to be the missing link for what happens in 2019 and maybe even in 2020 for some of them. ", "Erika Najarian ", "Got it. And my follow up question is on the consumer loan side, it was up $1.7 billion on a linked quarter basis. Two of your peers are more relatively upbeat in terms of the consumer outlook for 2018 especially relative to tax reform. And the question for you is, has the attrition in the consumer book bottomed in 2017? ", "And on the mortgage side as you think about non-conforming loan growth and loan originations, is there still a gap between what your underwriting standards are today and what you think they could go down to if we had better guidance or reformed guidance from the agencies on mortgage?", "Tim Sloan", "So, Erika good question. I think let me respond in a couple of ways. First, I think it's absolutely fair and the feedback that we've been getting from our customers is that we should all be cautiously optimistic on the impact of the tax reform act on consumers. There have been millions of employed folks across the country that have gotten pay races and bonuses and the like, and I think that\u2019s a net positive for economic growth. ", "As it relates to cyclically to our consumer loan growth, we believe that we will grow mortgage loans this year. We believe that we will grow credit cards this year. But we believe that it\u2019s likely that the home equity book will continue to decline, not -- if you look at the home equity book and you divide it in the kind of the post crisis and pre-crisis book, pre-crisis book just continues to decline as we\u2019ve been talking about for years. But we expect the post crisis book to grow. But I don\u2019t think that growth will offset the decline in the home equity book for 2018. ", "And then likewise as John mentioned at it relates to auto, we believe that with all the changes that are going on in the auto portfolio, notwithstanding the underlying credit improvement and new originations, that we will see a continued decline in that portfolio throughout 2018 and in our current estimates this maybe, the lines will start to cross the fourth quarter this year may be first quarter 2019, it\u2019s -- we will find out. But I would think about our consumer portfolio, we are optimistic about -- again about the impact of the tax act on consumers.", "Erika Najarian ", "Follow-up on the underwriting side. ", "Tim Sloan", "Yes, we don\u2019t anticipate making any changes to our underwriting. Our underwriting, as it relates to mortgage, that we look at those every day and we are going to be competitive from a market standpoint. We are also going to take the long-term view and not get too aggressive at any one point in time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Tim Sloan", "Congratulations Matt. You were right. We needed to provide $1 expense guidance. We listened to you. Can you mark that down in your calendar?", "Matt O'Connor", "I do think it\u2019s a good first step given [Multiple Speakers] 2019 and 2020 trajectory, I think of great importance. So, appreciate that\u2019s coming in a few minds. The only thing I \u2018m really been focused on and obviously the market as well is just the legacy issues and at this point a year and a quarter after taking over CEO and obviously being in very senior roles for many years before, do you feel like you\u2019ve identified Tim, all of the legacy issues and they have been all disclosed. And now you are at the point where you\u2019re just finishing out working through them internally and hoping to reach settlements this year where applicable?", "Tim Sloan", "Well Matt it\u2019s a very fair question, particularly with the accrual that we took this quarter. And my answer continues to be very consistent and that is I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in terms of looking at the operations of the company. But I can\u2019t provide you with a guarantee or absolute assurance that we won\u2019t be making additional changes in the future to anything that we might find. But again, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.", "Matt O'Connor", "And I guess I wonder why you can\u2019t. Because I feel like -- you\u2019ve been there a long time, John has been there a long time. I appreciate it\u2019s a big company and any company can have issues that arise. So, I am not trying to kind of get the all clear on everything for forever. But it does seem like there\u2019s a number of issues that are probably legacy in nature that you\u2019ve identified and I would assume you\u2019ve reviewed and re-reviewed in triple shake [ph] banks or are doing that now and I do still think it\u2019s great importance to be able to turn the page whether it\u2019s for the investors, the employees, I would think it\u2019s relevant too, so that\u2019s why just continued to push on this as well.", "Tim Sloan", "Look this is very reasonable question and I love to live in a world where I can give you an absolute guarantee and certainty, but it\u2019s just not the world we live in. I mean we\u2019ve been working very hard and looking at operations across the company. We have invested a significant amount of money in doing that, we\u2019ve been very transparent when we have issues for all of you. I know that sometimes it\u2019s disappointing, but that was the promise that we made and when we find that we\u2019ve made any sort of mistakes we fix them and if there is a customer on the other end that\u2019s been harmed, we will remediate them. But I just can\u2019t provide you with that absolute guarantee at this moment in time, maybe someday I will, but I think it\u2019s going to be something we look at the rare view mirror over a longer period of time as opposed to having some inflection point today or tomorrow or the week after that. ", "Matt O'Connor", "And just last thing on this, are there certain businesses or regions or customer segments that you are still reviewing, maybe they\u2019re not as close customers to you like those third-party relationships that can be a little trickier like are there still segments that you\u2019re reviewing that you are just not a 100% sure is not issues or?", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah. again, it\u2019s a fair question. I would say that we\u2019re continuing to look across the entire company as opposed to in any specific area. Again, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress, but as I reflect on my first year and a quarter in this role, I think it\u2019s fair to say that one of the mistakes that we\u2019ve made at this company was that we didn\u2019t have a thorough enough review of the businesses on an ongoing basis. So, our review will be continuing, we\u2019re never going to declare victory, we\u2019re going to always make sure that we\u2019ve got the right checks and balances from a corporate risk standpoint and an audit standpoint and we\u2019re making even more investments in the infrastructure and collecting data in a different way. So, we want to continue to make improvements. So, again the punch line matters that we\u2019ve made a lot of progress and we\u2019ve been very disclosive, but I can\u2019t provide you with absolute certainty. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Ken Usdin", "Hi, good morning Tim. How are you guys doing. Questions on the fee side of the business. Maybe to start with, nice to see that trust side are actually moving the right way. I\u2019m just wondering how much of that is any improvement in transaction side. How much of it is the higher markets and what\u2019s your just basic outlook for how that business can do going ahead?", "Tim Sloan", "Well we\u2019re optimistic and we\u2019ve seen growth in that business for the last few years, we\u2019ve had a nice transition [Multiple Speakers] that\u2019s a good point John, we\u2019ve had a nice transition in the senior leadership from David Carol who did a terrific job to John Wise. I think John mentioned in the fourth quarter that he thought we'd see 4% to 5% type revenue growth this year. And so, we continue to be optimistic. A large part of the increase in the fourth quarter to your point was related to higher underlying values, but again that tends to drive revenues in future too. But we continue to be optimistic about that business and to reinforce John's point about the improvement in referrals from community banking to wealth and investment management. ", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. And I guess I'm just wondering the markets are up a lot and your referrals are up a lot, but obviously the revenues are up but not as much. So that whole underlying shift to seize and decompression, is that start to stabilize or is it just an ongoing burden you always just have to overcome on with volume?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, your point is fair. Because there have been some changes in the business that attracted the entire market because of the DOL rule and implementation last year. And it's a competitive business, but again, I think John was clear that he, John Jon Weiss clear that he thought that he would see 4%, 5% not even say 6% growth on the top-line. So, we're comfortable with that. ", "John Shrewsberry", "I also think this secular shift this intentional shift to emphasize recurring asset management relationships over transactional revenue. Means you've got the means, the outcome that you're describing but less volatility around it because you're less reliant on people trading stocks and more aligned with the managed solution which is a more stable form of revenue. ", "Ken Usdin", "Got it, okay. And then just to keep on in another big area, fees. Just on the mortgage business, you got your platform rolling out and there is obviously it's major potential transition happening just with rates, and tax and housing markets. So, what's your expectation for just your size of the mortgage market and what do you think share can be? And within that, you've got a big, big mix sale of correspondent versus retail as a percentage. And can your new platform start to change that mix?", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah. So, I think the NBA is calling for the overall mortgage market size to be down a little bit. They can't factor in what might happen with more economic expansion as a result of the tax act. But call the size of the market unchanged to down, it's probably going to continue to be a little bit more of a purchase market from a reify market or trending more in that direction, which is a more competitive market for us to operate in. As a big servicer, we have an advantage in the reify market. As a result, our retail share may end up being a little bit lower, but we do a lot of correspondent lending and servicing. And so, our volumes represent the aggregate of what we originate directly and what we fund and service for correspondents. ", "So that's part of why margin is down because that mix from retail to correspondent means our costs are less but our revenue opportunities is less too. So, I think it's our expectation that the market is flat to down a little bit. Again, unless tax reform does something remarkable which will be great. I think it's our expectations that gets, it stays competitive. I mentioned in my comments. We think the first quarter is going to be a lower margin quarter than the fourth quarter based on what we can see. Some of that is specific behavior and a part of the agencies, because of programs that they run in the fourth quarter to get things done. And as it relates to our competitiveness, whether it's our feet on the street or our technological innovation that's rolling out right now, we anticipate being as competitive as we can possibly be in every market and maintaining our leading share. And so, it's a big point of emphasis for Michael DeVito and the folks who manage that team, but we don't want to cede that position. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. ", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "Great, thanks. Hey, good morning. Quick question on the loan growth, it looks like CRE was loan growth again this quarter and you did mention that you saw focusing on continued credit discipline. But can you maybe breakdown kind of what you are seeing in that market currently, how much farther do you have to kind of wind down this book, I mean how much lower can it go? ", "Tim Sloan", "We don\u2019t want to wind down this book. I mean we are the largest commercial real estate lender by far in not only in total but in almost every product type and we have the most diverse and broadest commercial real estate platform in the market. We are committed to this business long-term. But to be committed to the real estate business long-term you need to also make important and disciplined decisions when you see that you are at a period in the cycle that doesn\u2019t last forever but a period in a cycle where, things that that -- underwriting standard or pricing might be a little bit out of balance. That\u2019s how you get to stay in this business through cycles because you made good decisions. So, we want to grow this book but we want to grow it in a way that makes the right decisions for our shareholders. ", "So, what we have seen this year is an increase in competition, slightly lower in credit spread -- standards excuse me, and a little bit more aggressive pricing and that's meant that our book has declined a little bit. But again, we\u2019ve got a balanced business here and so our real estate capital markets business has absolutely been on fire and you can see that other parts of revenue in the company. So, I wouldn\u2019t look at this as we\u2019re purposely rolling down this book because we don\u2019t like the business, we love the business. We want to grow it so that we are ready for next year and the next cycle. ", "Brian Kleinhanzl", "And then maybe a separate question on the retail bank metrics, like the primary consumer checking account growth, just the other positive year-over-year, if you look at it where it was last December, you\u2019re up 3% year-on-year. May be if you could break down what you are seeing with regards to new customer acquisition versus the attrition? Because I thought you said the attrition had slowed, did you see the acceleration in the fourth quarter? Thanks.", "Tim Sloan", "I don\u2019t think we saw acceleration. I think that Mary Mack and team are doing a terrific job in terms of fundamentally changing that platform. It takes time to make changes in a business that has 5,800 branches and call centers and tens of thousands of team members who are working very hard. We made changes in terms of incentive plan. We made changes in terms of the management team to streamline that. We\u2019ve improved training and we\u2019ve also delegated responsibility so that our folks in branches can address customer opportunities and needs more quickly, that takes time. But I am pleased with the progress and our expectation for 2018 as we are going to see checking account growth, I would also say -- primary checking account growth, I would also say an improvement over what you saw in the fourth quarter but I would also say that underlying value of those accounts has increased, and we\u2019ve talked about that at Investor Day last year. And we are continuing to see that trend.", "John Shrewsberry", "One thing I would add is that the 2015, \u201816 primary checking account growth numbers were also benefited by a major attempt to convert people who were primary. They were customers of Wells Fargo but they were at that point primary into primary customers. And so, we had a backlog of relationships to convert to primary that we\u2019ve, I\u2019d say we basically worked through and now it\u2019s really about net new customers to the bank and making them primary customers. And so just to comp owner. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "Back to the loan growth front. Thanks for the color on the areas you\u2019ve commented on already. I know you\u2019re seeing some of the interest in still and auto and declines in home equity and you\u2019re being selective in CRE. So, given that as you look at 2018, can we see growth in 2018 in average loans versus full year 2017? And as a commercial that can really drive that growth despite the headwinds?", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah. Hope so, our plan is to do that, John. I think the wild card is just the pace of underlying economic growth, and we\u2019re the largest lender in this country and so we\u2019re dependent not only on the hard work and effort of the great team of relationship managers, but it\u2019s also a function of economic growth. So, if we see an increase in economic growth that should be a net positive. Just anecdotally I would tell you that I\u2019ve spent a lot of money in the last week and a half with our commercial and corporate customers and there is a lot of optimism out there. ", "John Shrewsberry", "The C&I loans, credit card and first mortgage is likely where our net loan growth is going to come from in 2018 and similar to the quarter. ", "John Pancari", "Got it, got it. Thanks John. And then just secondly on capital, I know we\u2019ve seen that article recently in the journal in the camel ratings and everything. And assuming -- I know you haven\u2019t commented on it, but want to say if you have anything to say about the ratings. And then secondly if that is true and everything is there an implication in terms of capital deployment. And if you could just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about deployment as you look at 2018?", "Tim Sloan", "So, fair question given the media coverage. We can\u2019t comment on confidential supervisory information from our regulators and so we won\u2019t. But as it relates to capital return, I think that I said it early in the call and John repeated it that we\u2019re pleased to have increased the amount of capital returned to our shareholders by 16% year-over-year and our expectation is that we will continue to increase capital return because we have excess capital at the company to fund our growth. And so, our goal is to reduce our 11.9% Tier 1 common equity number over the next few years to something closer to 10%. I don\u2019t know exactly what that means in terms of what our submission for C-CAR is this year or next year for that matter. But, we\u2019re certainly going in that direction. John, I don\u2019t know if you have any other comment.", "John Shrewsberry", "No, that\u2019s right the I guess I was interpreting the question also mean deployment for growth and loan portfolio and that would be the first call on our capital share and make loans for our customers. There is no M&A in our future that would be a use of capital that we can possibly imagine at this point. And thus, the high starting point in the ongoing relatively high level of capital generation should lead to attempting to return more of that to shareholders. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. ", "John McDonald", "Hi. Hey, good morning. Just want to clarify the outlook on expenses the range for 2018, that would include the community contribution stuff that you list on page 3, the $400 million on donations and the other things there?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yes, it does. And the higher base pay for the roughly $70,000 fee numbers. ", "John McDonald", "Okay. And then, John, you also mentioned hoping to get to 59 handles on the efficiency ratio by late 2018? I guess you had to kind of make some assumptions about kind of the economy and rate hikes there. Could you just give us some sense of what it would take to kind of get there?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yeah, I mean. I think we are imagining 3 rate hikes built into our baseline scenario. We don't have a lot of economic impact from tax reform built into our current forecast for 2017 to the extent that it achieves its desired goals to see some upside there. I think those would be the big drivers. And one of the key estimations we have to make as what's going to happen with deposit pricing throughout the course of the year. I think we're anticipating normalizing betas over the course of the year that feeds into that range.", "John McDonald", "Okay. And how do you evaluate further reduction in the swaps, what's kind of the calculus that you go through? And has that remain fairly way you've got. ", "John Shrewsberry", "Sure. The calculus is what is our outlook for rates over the next couple of years versus what the forward curve implies because that's where swap pricing comes from. And if we think that if there is a chance that we're going to be earning more over the next couple of years, then it might make sense to get out of today's fixed rate to get back into a floating rate scenario. Then we do the math to figure out what the swap mark is and the amortization cost is and what the benefit of increased asset sensitivity is. And we've been doing that and it's made sense to us to reduce that position. ", "John McDonald", "Okay. And then just on the expense outlook and efficiencies. I know you don't want to get into 2019, 2020 too much, but just maybe broader thoughts. I'm not sure if this came up before, I think it might have, but with all the tailwinds that you have in '19 and '20 is, is there any reason that directionally the 2019 expenses wouldn't be down absent a material pickup in business operations. And then maybe John, you can address that. And Tim, are you holding or Tim, is there any reason you wouldn't be holding a team to getting back that efficiency ratio middle of that range, the 55 to 59 by 2019 and further deeper into the range in 2020. Is that broadly a goal that you're going to hold folks too?", "Tim Sloan", "I'll pick that. That's a goal that I hold myself too as well as the senior management team. So, you're spot on there John. ", "John Shrewsberry", "And there is no reason, for the reasons that we've laid out, the expectation is that those incremental cost would be coming off in '19 and '20 and expenses would continue to trend lower. The caveat I guess I would give is if there was some -- several years ago we went through a period like this where we gave specific expense guidance and then there was a wild mortgage reify here with a revenue opportunity was used and expenses, direct expenses grew to reflect to take advantage of it. So, absence something like that, which we'd all be happy about if occurred, then as you say, there is no reason to believe the expenses shouldn't keep coming down based on these structural items that we're talking about that will fall off. ", "John McDonald", "Okay. And again, just to clarify Tim. How would you phrase the efficiency ratio goal over the next 2 to 3 years?", "Tim Sloan", "As we said, our expectation is to get -- by the end of this year to get down to 59 handle and then continue to make progress year after year after year. We should be within the 55% to 59%, that\u2019s a goal to get in there. And then once we are in that range, we are going to continue to make progress. We\u2019ve got to improve the efficiency of this company. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, good morning. A couple of follow-ups. One, the 53.5 to 54.5 expense target that you\u2019ve put out for this next year, what is the relative number that we are assessing that against in 2017? I know there\u2019s a lot of one-timers here. And I just wanted to get what your view on 2017 like-for-like is?", "John Shrewsberry", "We\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t really normalize our 2017 expenses and I think many people would obviously look to take out their larger operating losses that we experienced. But beyond that I wouldn\u2019t view much of a normalization for you just because it\u2019s a slippery slope.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And then second question is just on liquidity. I noticed there was a couple of questions already on that. But I think if I heard you correctly, it accelerates beyond what we\u2019re generating today. Your expectation is that you might need to reset deposit rates, did I hear you right on that?", "Tim Sloan", "Actually, my reference there is more to the market. I don\u2019t think people appreciate how much the industry is holding the line of retail and small business deposit prices. It might be as a result of the fact that there\u2019s been a lackluster on demand. And if the economy heats up because of tax reform and everybody has got higher loan growth, then somebody is going to -- may very well begin to defend their deposit franchise in order to fund it, or to attract deposits in order to fund it. So that\u2019s more of an industry comment than a Wells Fargo comment specifically.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. If you mind giving us your view on your situation just grace the question because your LDR looks like it\u2019s around 73 or 74 so, seems like there \u2026", "John Shrewsberry", "I would say that we don\u2019t think that we have to do too much, although again if there\u2019s a big cyclical change that causes betas to catch up to where people might have previously imagined they should be, looking at prior cycles of rate increases, then if we\u2019re looking for a catalyst or imagining one that could cause that, one of the things that could cause it is a big pick up in loan demand, it hasn\u2019t been there. And we\u2019ve been studying deposit response as an industry without that loan demand, if you were to add loan demand, it could change things, that\u2019s my point. Your point is right, our loan-to-deposit ratio is very modest. We\u2019ve got a lot of liquidity where we are not in a position where we think we need to attract a lot of incremental deposits to fund the next $10 billion of loans. But the industry overall has -- should be thinking about whether an increase in loan demand overall changes the calculus for deposit pricing.", "Tim Sloan", "And Betsy just on deposit pricing for a minute, I would just also make an observation separate from John\u2019s point which I completely agree with on loan demand and the potential impact is that when I think about the interaction and the relationship that we have with consumers, it\u2019s not just about deposit pricing, it\u2019s about how much firms are expanding from a marketing standpoint which doesn\u2019t go into deposit pricing line and I think there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about that this year, that\u2019s maybe ramped up for some firms more than others. It\u2019s also about the massive investment that we\u2019ve been making in technology to improve innovation so that we\u2019re not at the margin just competing on price, we\u2019re competing upon the value of the relationship and the convenience in the service that we can provide. And we look at the pace of innovation particularly for us, I think that\u2019s been one of the drivers and some of the reasons why we\u2019ve been able to continue to attract deposits. We\u2019re providing real value to all of our customers because of the massive increase in innovation and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. So, we\u2019re not just competing on price. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. ", "Tim Sloan", "Good morning. Thank you very much for those comments on CNBC this morning, my mother thinks -- you\u2019re now her favorite analyst. ", "Scott Siefers", "At least I am somebody's favorite analyst. Thank you, please pass along my gratitude. Tim, I guess actually John I have got a question for you. On the NII outlook for 2018, I appreciate the comments earlier on the rate outlook that\u2019s actually there. Are you still thinking kind of a low single-digit number for NII growth year-on-year is good for 2018?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yeah. I think it\u2019s a little earlier to fully forecast it. There is a lot going on. And we\u2019re just talking about deposit pricing and what that means that could be a huge driver of this year. It wasn\u2019t really as much of a topic last year. We\u2019re shaving some NII of the top for the -- on the tax equivalency front for our tax-exempt investments that\u2019s probably worth $400 million and some change in 2018 versus 2017. And then the loan growth and cash deployment are going to matter too. So, it is a stated goal that we\u2019re trying to grow net interest income period-over-period, year-over-year and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re vectoring towards. But, at this point may be at Investor Day it will be easier to think about the year as a whole because we will have a quarter and some change behind us. But, I wouldn\u2019t pencil in last year\u2019s growth rate this year until we get a little bit further into and we know what tax reform means and a couple of other things. ", "Scott Siefers", "Okay. All right. Perfect. And I think you hit my next SCE question on there as well. So, appreciate it. And then actually just on the effective tax rate guidance. When you look at sort of gap between your effective tax rate and the FTE tax rate, any noticeable change that we should expect now that tax reform is down in there?", "John Shrewsberry", "No, no I don\u2019t think so. And we\u2019ll probably continue to give \u2013 well we\u2019ll certainly give call out changes in our guidance on the effective tax rate overall if conditions change throughout the course of the year, it will be impacted by a couple of things. Most notably how much money we\u2019re making. But that\u2019s the number for now. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. ", "Saul Martinez", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the fees, on the overdraft to wide product and forgive me if I missed, but did you quantify how much that adversely impacted deposit fees in 4Q. And how much more it could linger on into the 1Q 2018 results?", "Tim Sloan", "So, it was $19 million in the quarter although it came in during the quarter. And so, it will be -- it will probably be more in the first quarter. And we\u2019ll see how customers adapt to that capability overtime. ", "And just for anybody, who isn't familiar with the product, essentially if you overdraft payments tonight and your direct deposit hits in the morning, we don't charge you for the overdraft, it happened the night before, that's where the Rewind comes from. So, we'll see a full quarter of it in Q1, we'll call it out at the end of the quarter and make it transparent so the people can model it in. But we think it's a very useful capability to help folks who are generally speaking right at the end of the pay cycle when they have an overdraft situation and then rectify it the next day. ", "Saul Martinez", "Okay, that's helpful. And secondly on John, on your comments on deposit betas and the possibility of sort of maybe a non-linear type of increase in deposit betas if you start to get loan growth. Is there any way to -- I know you're probably going to say it's difficult to put numbers around it, but I'll ask anyway? If you were to see loan growth pickup and let's just say loan growth picks up to mid-single digits. Is there any way to think through the parameters about how much deposit betas can move up maybe based on history or some assumptions of consumer behavior? But is there any way to think about sort of the parameters around which you might see deposit competition and deposit betas move up in that type of scenario. ", "John Shrewsberry", "I don't have a silver bullet for you. But I can tell you that you could stress or model some sort of a catch up to historically normal levels, call it the 40% level. And then ask yourself, by bank who might go first and why? And as Tim mentioned, there are a lot of non-economic reasons for customers who want to maintain relationships maintain balances etcetera call it the very full service with the less full service. All of those things matter. But everybody's deposit franchise is going to look a little bit different. So, people have more core primary types of transactional account relationships and some people are funded with how their money they are seeking the highest yield at any point in time. And that's going to, it's different banks that are going to behave differently. My general guess is that within the relevant range for likely loan growth for Wells Fargo, that if we achieve the higher end of that range, and the impact on our deposit price isn't really going to be because we think that we need to go out and raise more money and jack up our deposit cost, but rather that it's happening to others and they're doing it and we respond -- and if we feel we need to we will be responding to what's happening in the market. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Bush", "Hi, gentlemen. I have a couple of questions for you. And this probably falls into the last question as well. For many years, you were the lowest rate payer in the nation and you are able to maintain that through the location of branches et cetera et cetera. From a competitive standpoint and given the issues over the last couple of years, do you need to kind of get into the middle of the pack or the top? I mean how do you feel competitively, where you need to be positioned with deposit pricing in a rising rate environment. ", "Tim Sloan", "Yeah, Nancy it's a very fair question. I don't think our view particularly as it relates to retail consumer customers has really changed. And what you have seen in our deposit pricing so far, this year is that we're one of the lowest if not the lowest in the industry. And our expectation is that we will continue to be able to do that because of the franchise that we have, not only the physical franchise but also the digital franchise that we\u2019ve continued to invest in, based upon the innovation and the convenience that we are providing to our customers. I think when you move from traditional retail deposit customers to wealth customers, it\u2019s more competitive and you\u2019ve seen the higher weighted there and we\u2019re kind of in the middle, and that\u2019s fine with us. I think we\u2019re comfortable there. And then as you move to larger corporate customers or financial institutions and the like, it\u2019s very competitive, where your deposit days are close to 100 percentage you can get. And I think that\u2019s been pretty consistent through cycles for us as well as the rest of the industry. So that\u2019s how I would break it down.", "John Shrewsberry", "On the last point I would add, we\u2019ve been a little bit more active with some of the financial institution customers to get their deposits because we don\u2019t have a leverage ratio problem so we can afford to have a slightly better balance sheet. We can use the liquidity from time-to-time. So, if we weren\u2019t doing that, because that is the highest cost deposit number, we probably weighted average basis like a lower deposit cost payer. But it\u2019s really some purpose to do more business of various types with those customers by having that deposit relationship. ", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. And also, the follow-on I have is about branch closures. And I am sure you guys have seen the articles over the past couple of months, there was a series I think in the Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago, about how rural America is being impacted by branch closures that there are many small towns now that basically have no bank branches. And I am wondering if this is the coming of bigger regulatory issue or it\u2019s coming more on to the regulatory radar screen and do you guys anticipate that you may in the future have to not close branches that you would have closed otherwise because of their locations?", "Tim Sloan", "Well Nancy again it\u2019s a fair question. I think that when we look at our branch network, we included a number of factors beyond just a P&L for the branch as a likely expectation for growth or quality of customers. There is also CRA type requirements and other reasons that we want to keep branches open in certain markets. ", "But to your specific question about regulatory interaction, we haven\u2019t had any increase in regulatory interaction related to a significant increase of -- regulatory interaction related to rural branches as of this point. ", "John Shrewsberry", "I would say there is big investment in digital capability that allows people to bank from anywhere including opening accounts, including applying for and having credit trenches [ph] including deposit taking, eases the burden doesn\u2019t completely remove it, but it makes it easier for people who live far from branches even if there is a branch there, may be 30 miles away, still be in the county. We are making it easier for people to do that from home. So, it\u2019s a better situation than it was 20 years ago or 40 years ago and that same calculus is being weighed. ", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Good morning. Can you guys share with us -- you talked about bringing this efficiency ratio down with 59 handle on by the end of the year and then further improvement in following periods. What percentage of the improvement comes from revenue versus expenses or vice versa. How much is going to come from expenses versus revenues?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, you can see the range that we\u2019re talking about for expenses for the year and while that\u2019s an annual number and other quarterly number. We showed some sensitivity around our 2017 on our revenue items. So, right now we\u2019re very focused on specific actions that are being taken on the expense side. And we have to make some assumptions about what\u2019s happening in the revenues estimate, what the handle range will be on efficiency later in the year. ", "And very importantly, I\u2019d remind everybody that Q1 is a very -- is high for seasonal expense I think you know that, it is your business. But that\u2019s something to account for. So, John asked the question earlier about what\u2019s going to happen -- or I forgot who asked the question about NII in 2018, there is a range of estimates depending on the drivers that I mentioned similarly on the noninterest income front. We\u2019ve got a lot of things that are core and easy -- easier to forecast but there\u2019ll be other just as well. So, we\u2019re trying to grow revenue. We have control over expense and it\u2019s the expense that we\u2019re through specifically pointing to in terms of what\u2019s driving the outcome. ", "Gerard Cassidy", "Okay. And then in your community banking metrics in slide 24, you obviously give us good data on the digital customer\u2019s and such. And you guys have alluded to on the call about opening up new accounts and selling products through these lines and that seems to be where the industry is going and you\u2019re going. Can you share with us what kind of penetration you have whether it\u2019s credit cards or other types of consumer loan products that you\u2019re actually opening up through the online channel versus people having to come into a branch?", "Tim Sloan", "So, right now I\u2019d say credit card is probably the easiest one to point to. I think 43% of card originations in 2017 were digital. Now, to be fair we -- it\u2019s not so important to us what that percentage is, we want more of our customers to have our card in their wallet and if they get it digitally or they get it in-person either will work. But, 43% are trending towards half of our card openings were digitally transacted in 2017. That\u2019s an interesting metric and that\u2019s up from a very small percentage in prior years. ", "Mortgage will be -- this will be the year to see to see what the trend is there as we fully roll out the digital mortgage applications, people who aren\u2019t -- including people who aren\u2019t already customers in Wells Fargo. And while we have the digital account opening process for two of the investor which is something that we\u2019ll be measuring all year and figure out how much benefit our customers and prospects drive from interacting with us in that way.", "Gerard Cassidy", "And just on the mortgage, when do you guys go live with that again? I knew it was this year, but is it first quarter or second quarter?", "Tim Sloan", "Well, it\u2019s live now for a people who are already customers of Wells Fargo. You can enter through -- I know you all are customers at Wells Fargo, you can log on to our online banking or digital banking platform you can see it there. But it will be available for all comers in the first quarter. ", "Gerard Cassidy", "Okay. And then just my final question in your wholesale banking side you talk about investment banking market share dropped to 3.6% versus 4.4%, the narrow scope focus. Can you give us some background or color on what you mean by what you did to the market share came down?", "John Shrewsberry", "Yeah. And let me give in order that\u2019s going to reflect some large deal volume could be some leverage finance volume, it could be cross boarder activity, some of which are probably higher beta for us depending on whether we get it or not. I think on an annual basis, we probably assume that we're still going to trend towards the 5% 6% plus market share range, which is where we've been recently. But I'm going to think terribly different. ", "Tim Sloan", "As you said to reinforce John's point. I think what we saw in fourth quarter was more leverage buyout type transactions and kind of this because of our underlying credit discipline. We tend to have a lower percent market share in those types of deals. And so that would at the margin probably have driven most of that decline. ", "Tim Sloan", "Again, thank you all for joining us this morning. I know it's always a busy morning the first day of earnings for the industry. I want to reiterate the fact that 2017 was a very transformational year for Wells Fargo. And I also want to emphasize the hard work, dedication and resiliency of our team members, who made the company a better bank today than it was a year ago. And again, notwithstanding the challenges that we have ahead, I'm optimistic that Wells Fargo will be a better bank a year from now. So again, thank you for your support.
