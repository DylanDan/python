Today we will review our results for the fourth quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2017. We will also provide consolidated full year 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results.", "Our segment results are presented based on the updated Willis Towers Watson structure. We provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in Form 8-K filed on July 14, 2016.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our results which mark the end of our first year as Willis Towers Watson. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion flat as compared to pro forma prior year revenues. This includes $74 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis.", "For the quarter, revenues on an organic basis were up by 1%. Reported revenues for the year were $7.9 billion up 5% as compared to pro forma prior year revenues. Adjusted revenues for the year were $7.9 billion up 6% as compared to pro forma prior year revenues. This includes $202 million of negative currency on a pro forma basis. For the year, organic revenues were up by 2%.", "Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $34 million as compared to the prior year pro forma net income of $66 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $419 million or 21.7% of revenues, as compared to the prior year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $406 million, or 21.1% of revenues. We are pleased to see year-over-year margin enhancement, which is consistent with our goal.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $1.8 billion, or 22.3% of adjusted revenues, as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the prior year of $1.7 billion, or 22.5% of adjusted revenues.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.25 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.88. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a positive impact of $0.19 on adjusted diluted EPS. For the year, diluted earnings per share were $2.26, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.96. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a positive impact of $0.08 on adjusted diluted EPS.", "Before moving on to the segment results, I\u2019d like to highlight the progress made in 2016 and provide an update on three areas of integration, revenue synergies, cost synergies, and tax savings. Reflecting on our first year as Willis Towers Watson, we\u2019ve accomplished a great deal in relatively short amount of time. We\u2019ve developed integrated market offerings for our stated revenue synergies. We\u2019ve also taken steps to enhance our profitability margins with OIP, our business restructuring program and cost synergies.", "Finally, we\u2019ve also refined our focus of financial discipline for long-term growth and enhanced our focus on business fundamentals. The impact of the benefits from the revenue synergies and cost programs will grow in 2017, and we feel we\u2019ve made very good progress against all of our objectives.", "So let me highlight some of these accomplishments in more detail. I\u2019ll start with the revenue synergies. As I mentioned in the previous earnings call, the 2016 revenue synergies were about 5% to 10% of our stated 2018 revenue synergy targets. So while they are may only a small portion of the overall goal, we\u2019re very pleased with the efforts and achieving and in some cases surpassing our 2016 revenue synergies sale goals.", "Our merger objective identified three specific areas of revenue synergies, Global Health Solutions, the U.S. mid-market exchange, and large market property and casualty. Let\u2019s start with Global Health Solutions. During 2016, we won 23 global or regional projects valued at over $18 million, and 120 were smaller single country projects for an additional $5 million.", "Turning to the U.S. mid-market exchange synergies, we added about 75,000 employees, which will provide approximately $15 million annually. Lastly, we surpassed the 2016 P&C revenue synergy goal with placements of almost 30 accounts representing eight different industries for approximately $12 million.", "On the tax front, we suppressed our original goal of 25% adjusted tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule. The 2016 merger related cost savings guidance was estimated at $20 million of savings in calendar 2016. And I\u2019m pleased to report that we ended the year with almost $40 million of savings.", "We feel very confident in meeting our 2018 cost savings objectives of $100 billion to $125 billion. Through the efforts of the operational improvement program or OIP, we saved approximately $89 million during 2016. We anticipate additional savings of $95 million as we exit 2017. The OIP program is expected to be completed at the end of 2017.", "In addition to the OIP program, we initiated a business restructuring program during the third quarter of 2016, which was completed in the fourth quarter. The restructuring impacted approximately 450 positions across all segments, which cost approximately $50 million, the majority of this cost was incurred in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re very focused in delivering on our various cost initiatives, the OIP cost related merger synergies and business restructuring to drive improved margins in 2017.", "Now, let\u2019s look at each of the segments in more detail. For the quarter, total reportable segment constant currency commissions and fees growth was 3%. Constant currency commissions and fees for Human Capital and Benefits were flat, Corporate Risk and Broking increased 6%, Investment, Risk and Reinsurance decreased 3%, and Exchange Solutions increased 21%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.", "Turning to Human Capital and Benefits or HCB. HCB commission and fee growth was flat. On an organic basis commissions and fees decreased 2%. The HCB segment experienced the largest impact of the business restructuring effort. More than 325 positions were eliminated. This restructuring was intended to create better alignment with client expectations and market demand, and also to improve our leverage model.", "However, given the size of this initiative in the HCB segment, we experienced more business disruption in this segment than in any of the others. Retirement commissions and fees were down as a result of a decrease in actuarial fees, partly offset by new pension administration client fees, the business restructuring impacted almost 160 positions mainly in Europe and the U.S.", "Demand for consulting assignments was down in the Netherlands and we\u2019re in an off cycle period of pension negotiations in the UK, which typically occur every three years. There was also less data related project work associated with bulk lump sums than anticipated. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were down primarily due to a decline in executive compensation in Reward and Talent and Communication work in North America.", "The restructuring impacted over 100 positions in Talent and Rewards. We saw fewer transaction related projects and uncertainty on regulatory and economic conditions in advance of the U.S. November elections. Healthcare consulting continued to see commission and fee growth, primarily as a result of new business one outside of the North American region.", "Technology and Administration Solutions or TAS continued to produce strong results due to the new clients. We continue to have a positive outlook for the HCB business in 2017 and expect momentum to build during the year.", "Turning to Corporate Risk and Broking or CRV; commissions and fees grew 6% from the prior year, as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees were flat. Revenue increased in all regions except for North America. Great Britain\u2019s revenue increased due to growth in construction, retail and aerospace; Western Europe grew as a result of Gras Savoye in the Affinity business in Northern Europe.", "International revenues increased as a result of Gras Savoye. A slight rebound in the Venezuela and Brazil P&C businesses was offset by continued softness in Asia and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.", "Revenue declined in North America as a result of less new business. We expect the general pricing trends to continue into 2017, but we also expect that we will gain momentum as we move into the second half of the calendar year.", "Now to Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; commissions and fees were down by 3% for the quarter. Organic commissions and fees declined 3%, primarily due to a decline in reinsurance and portfolio and underwriting services. The reinsurance line of business represents tree based reinsurance only. The Facultative Reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment.", "North America reinsurance and specialty revenue growth was more than offset by revenue declines in the international region and in portfolio and underwriting services due to weakness in underlying premiums and profit sharing programs and certain contracts, as well as rate competition. The fourth quarter is seasonally the softest quarter of the calendar year for IRR.", "We continue to see wholesale delivering solid results from Miller. Investment experience growth as a result of increased performance fees in the delegated investment services business. We\u2019re targeting growth for the IRR business in 2017. While the overall environment may not be changing dramatically, prior year comparables or soft and the sales pipeline is more robust in certain lines of business.", "Lastly, Exchange Solutions finished up the year with another outstanding quarter with commissions and fees of $174 million, an increase of 21%. Driven by record enrollments, our Retiree and Access Exchange revenues increased 34%, and the rest of the segment increased 9%.", "Increased membership in new clients drove the revenue increases. Our health and welfare and North American pension outsourcing business is continue to grow primarily as a result of the new business one over the last two years, which added almost 400,000 lives. We had a very successful exchange enrollment season.", "As a reminder, revenues are generally recognized as the healthcare plans become effective, which is January first for most of our enrolments. Revenues are recognized on a prorated basis through the calendar year. We enrolled approximately 110,000 retirees and more than 250,000 total lives on the active exchange, our biggest active enrolment ever. Approximately 65% of the active enrolments run the liaison platform and the balance were enrolled on our large company platform.", "We continue to find that first year savings are between 5% and 15%. Now most of our clients\u2019 targeted savings of 5% to 8% as they custom configure their plan design. That equates to a first year savings of approximately $500 per employee.", "Our 2017 sales pipeline continues to look strong, especially in the mid-market. Large companies continue to be more deliberate in their decision making process, but we have four large clients that have already committed for the 2018 enrollment period. We expect the mid-market to continue adopt at a faster pace than the large companies. We anticipate the revenue growth to slow a little bit in 2017, but continue to feel good about the momentum of this business in the long-term.", "Perhaps, one of the most important developments of 2016 was confirmation of the merger rationale. While the 2016 revenue performance may not fully reflect our integration in sales efforts the commitment I see from our colleagues throughout the organization and the steps we\u2019ve taken to build the framework for long-term success gives me great confidence in achieving our merger objectives. We still have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but the momentum continues to build.", "Most important, we have to keep focusing on our clients carry forward the financial disciplines initiated in 2016 and continue to work collaboratively as we build and improve our go-to-market strategies. I\u2019d like to conclude my comments today by thanking all of our colleagues for their hard work over this last year. I\u2019m looking forward to reporting on our future success.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to add my thanks to our colleagues around the globe for all their efforts during 2016. As we take a step back and consider the progress we\u2019ve made in just 12 months, bringing together 40,000 colleagues from three legacy companies in over 140 countries. It\u2019s really quite an accomplishment. While we still have a couple of years to complete our integration, the actions required in the first year of building a new organization and culture are the hardest and most sensitive.", "There\u2019s simply a lot of change to absorb. It took a lot of collaboration and commitment to get us where we are today, and as we turned into our second year, I saw the necessary foundation for ultimate success building in the right direction.", "Now for the financial results; as a reminder our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation. Income from operations for the quarter was $88 million, or 4.6% of revenues.", "The prior year fourth quarter pro forma operating income was $131 million, or 6.8% of pro forma revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $374 million or 19.4% of revenues and the prior year quarter pro forma adjusted operating income was $377 million or 19.6% of pro forma revenues.", "As we highlighted earlier, revenue pressure and seasonality related to Gras Savoye impacted the fourth quarter margin. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $551 million, or 7% of revenues. The prior year pro forma operating income was $765 million, or 10.2% of revenues.", "Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $1.6 billion or 20.4% of adjusted revenues and the prior year pro forma adjusted operating income was $1.5 billion, or 20.2% of pro forma revenues. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 3% and the adjusted tax rate was 19%. For 2016 the GAAP tax rate was 3% and the adjusted tax rate was 21%.", "Before we discuss the segment operating results, I\u2019d like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the Form 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016.", "Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues. For the fourth quarter, the operating margin for the Human Capital and Benefits segment or HCB was 20% as compared to pro forma 21% in 2015. As expected, the 2016 margin trended lower due to the Gras Savoye margin being lower than the Company average. Revenue performance also impacted margin.", "For the year ended December 31, 2016, the HCB segment operating margin was 21% as compared to pro forma 22% in 2015. For the fourth quarter, the CRB business or Corporate Risk and Broking had a 32% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 33% in the prior year fourth quarter.", "Western Europe, as a result of Gras Savoye seasonality and lower margin profile, drove the margin down. Operating margin was 21% for both the year ended December 31, 2016, and pro forma 2015. For the quarter, the investment risk and reinsurance segment or IRR had a 1% operating margin as compared to pro forma negative 3% in the prior year fourth quarter.", "The margin improvement was from investment, RCS and wholesale. IRR experiences a seasonally low operating margin in the fourth quarter primarily driven by the timing of revenue in reinsurance. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the IRR segment operating margin inclusive of the JLT legal settlement was 21% as compared to pro forma 19% in 2015.", "For the quarter, the exchange solutions segment had an 8% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 10% margin in the prior year fourth quarter. TAS and Retiree and Access Exchanges led the segment with 23% and 18% operating margins respectively as we continued to invest in the active exchange. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Exchange Solutions segment operating margin was 16% as compared to 11% pro forma in the prior year.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. Free cash flow was $288 million in the fourth quarter and $745 million for the year ended 2016. This was almost $100 million greater than our original expectation as noted during our Analyst Day. We continue to focus on enhancing free cash flow in 2017.", "This stronger free cash flow provided the capital to repurchase approximately $400 million of Willis Towers Watson stock in 2016 rather than the previously announced $300 million we had initially targeted. In November we increased our share repurchase plan by $1 billion and anticipate a total repurchase of about $0.5 billion for 2017.", "On February 2017, the Willis Towers Watson Board of Directors approved a 10% increase to the regular quarterly cash dividend which will now be $0.53 per common share per quarter. This is targeted to maintain the payout ratio of approximately 25%.", "Now let\u2019s review our guidance for fiscal year 2017. In fiscal 2017 we are expecting constant currency revenue growth to be in the 2% to 3% range. Constant currency and organic revenue will be aligned as we now have a full year of results for all of the 2015 acquisitions.", "We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 23% to 24%. We continue to drive our business improvement and cost-reduction programs and expect to demonstrate clear momentum in 2017 toward our goal of a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. For segment revenues, we are expecting low single-digit constant currency commissions and fees growth for HCB, CRB and IRR.", "As we put a year of integration and restructuring focus behind us, we expect to see gradual growth enhancement in these businesses as the year goes on. Exchange Solutions revenue growth is expected to slow to around 10% due to stabilization of the retiree enrollments.", "As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, the retiree enrollments will be episodic from year-to-year depending on the timing of large clients joining the exchange. While we continue to expect the actives exchange growth to be very strong, the enrollment base is still relatively small.", "As of 2017, we\u2019re aligning the Max Matisson business from HCB to IRR and the fine arts and jewelry team from IRR to CRB. In addition, we are harmonizing corporate expense allocation methodologies. The changes made for 2017 will have an impact on year-over-year segment margins.", "Given these changes, we will not be providing segment margin guidance in 2017. You will continue to see the segment margin results each quarter and we plan to file a year-over-year comparison prior to our first quarter earnings.", "The 2017 adjusted tax rate is expected to be 23% to 24%. The tax rate is expected to increase from 2016 due to one-time discrete items which will not repeat in 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.55. Guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.25 to pound and $1.08 to the euro.", "We expect to generate approximately $30 million in merger cost synergies in 2017 and incur approximately $180 million of expense for integration related items. We are making good progress on the cost synergies and expect to achieve the high end of our 2018 savings goal of $100 million to $125 million.", "Integration expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures. As John mentioned earlier, we expect to save approximately $95 million from OIP in 2017, the final year of the program, and plan to spend approximately $140 million. The OIP restructuring will continue to be adjusted from GAAP measures.", "Finally depreciation is expected to be approximately $175 million to $195 million and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million. As we have been discussing, 2016 was a year of building a new organization; new way to address our clients\u2019 needs; and developing strong focus on financial management. I think we\u2019ve succeeded in building this foundation and I expect to see our financial performance momentum grow in 2017.", "Now I\u2019ll hand it back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Roger. And now we\u2019ll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Tunis", "Hey thanks. I guess, just following up on the segment outlooks for brokerage and for HRB next year, it sounded like low single-digit organic expense growth which implies a decent amount of acceleration from what we\u2019ve seen year-to-date especially on the brokerage side.", "I guess, looking back at 2016, you talked a little bit about the revenue synergies. How much do you think revenue dissynergies may have impacted that comp? Because I\u2019m trying to bridge from where we\u2019ve been in corporate risk and broking in IRR which has been zero to subzero to getting that to low single digits. Thanks.", "John Haley", "Okay, Roger may want to add to this, but I would say I think revenue synergies did not play any significant of fact that all. Frankly, we didn\u2019t really see any revenue dissynergies really across the Company. I think the reason for the revenue growth being off in 2016 was really reflected in a distraction that we had that took people \u2013 had them more internally focused than it should have been, didn\u2019t have the best go-to-market operation that we could have had and it distracted from our new business efforts. But I don\u2019t think revenue dissynergies were anything that really added to that.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay and then my follow-up, I guess, is just on thinking about 2% to 3% organic growth this year, and I guess, looking out to 2018 thinking about the $10 number; do you think you need acceleration off the 2% to 3% in 2018 to be able to hit that or are we still thinking that capital management and organic expense management can produce those type of results even if we are still sort of in a 2% to 3% organic growth environment? Thanks.", "John Haley", "Yes. So I think I would say this with regard to the $10 number, when you think about the various components that we had to get there. One of them was certainly revenue growth. Really we thought 3% plus was we needed to get to that to be achieving $10. The other items were our tax rate getting to 25% or better and I think we\u2019ve got a check next to that. Our share repurchase, actually, if you think about last year, in the beginning of the year we said we were going to try to be \u2013 purchase $200 million worth of shares last year.", "And then midway through, we said we\u2019d like to get to $300 million; we ended up purchasing $400 million. So we feel good about what we were able to accomplish there. As Roger said, we expect to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares this year, so that\u2019s in place as to where we want to be; and we will continue to buy shares back in 2018 also probably at a higher clip than we have in 2017.", "And then we want to get the expense savings and the margin enhancement; and we referenced a couple of times some of the OIP savings that we expect to get coming out of 2017. So we\u2019re on board for almost all the things. We just see we have to get the revenue growth up a little bit but we are focused right now on getting to the 2% to 3% level for 2017 and we think that will give us a good base to improve that going into 2018.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay and then just lastly, I guess, in the retirement business, if you could just help us understand the macro sensitivity of that just given the move higher run rates, the new administration. It sounds like a lot of the slowdown there was less actuarial work, lump sum, but it sounded like it was maybe being replaced with pension administration. How should we think about that if interest rates are sort of where they are, continuing to rise? Is that an area where you are going to continue to see kind of sluggish organic growth? Thanks.", "John Haley", "Yes, I think overall that\u2019s right. We\u2019ve had some of our competitors have reported and when you look at our retirement revenue growth, it\u2019s almost identical to there\u2019s so maybe that\u2019s not so surprising. Now on top of it though, we had the restructuring program which was largely focused on retirement. When I was younger, I used to think you could put these restructuring programs in place and not lose any revenue in the short run, but I\u2019ve learned from experience that is not the case.", "So the fact that we had retirement slow down a little bit was not a particular surprise here. That happened but we think \u2013 we love the restructuring we did. We think it positions us extraordinarily well for the future, so that was clearly the right thing to do. So that hurt us a little bit in the fourth quarter, but as I said, even then we still came out right at the same level as our competitors; so we feel good about this going into 2017. When we look at the outlook for 2017, I think the thing that we would most focus on is this is probably likely \u2013 it\u2019s never, you can never tell at this stage in the year.", "But this is probably likely to be a slower growth for bulk lump sum work \u2013 a real slowdown in bulk lump sum work compared to other years. Now bulk lump sum work, it varies. I mean, I think 2013 it was $28 million; 2014, I think it was over $75 million, I think it was around $77 million or something; it\u2019s been just under $50 million 2015 and 2016. We think it\u2019s going to go down substantially in 2017. But bulk lump sum is granular; one of the reasons we think it will probably go down is because we are likely to see several rate increases during the year.", "It\u2019s not the absolute level; it\u2019s the arbitrage between what you can pay out the lump sum at and what you are recording it at as the accounting expense. So 2017 might be a low year for bulk lump sums; in the end though, that may just mean that there is more work in 2018. We see this as you\u2019ve got to look at it on a multi-year cycle.", "Ryan Tunis", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Hi, good morning. Just looking at the margin in the quarter, could you talk about how you see the margin expansion given the low organic growth and just walk us through how much came from OIP dropping to the bottom line versus integration savings versus if there was any FX-margin benefit?", "Roger Millay", "Sure Sarah. Hi. We think again maybe just to step back to the margin trends for the year and we\u2019ve been watching all the elements closely quarter-to-quarter and as we said in the third quarter we saw probably about a few percentage points in sequential drop in expenses and that sort of trend continued into the fourth quarter. And really we think it\u2019s the combination as John and I both referred to in our remarks.", "It\u2019s the combination of continuing to push across the board on the savings initiatives which now you mentioned two of the elements and the third element is the business restructuring, so all of those kicking in, along with just the financial discipline that we are employing throughout the Company. So margin comes gradually and last time we said we weren\u2019t sure that we saw all those efforts flow through, but I think this time you are seeing it; so I think those were the drivers.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Okay great. Thanks. And then separately, I\u2019d be interested to get your thoughts on some of the macro issues post the U.S. election. If the U.S. tax rate fell to 20% but there was no interest deduction, what would that mean for Willis Towers Watson\u2019s earnings? And then also, would you be impacted by border adjustment at all since you\u2019re domiciled outside the U.S. Would your services be considered an import?", "John Haley", "So I think just generally on the taxes, it\u2019s two points. One is it depends very much on the details of how these things are structured as to how we could do that. Depending on exactly what\u2019s in there we could get a slight benefit; we could see our taxes even increase depending on what the details of that are. I think whatever we see, anything we have modeled, it is still within us achieving our 2018 goals of being at the 25% or less so nothing that would impact that. I think, and by the way all of the modeling we have done is sort of a worst-case because it\u2019s a steady-state assuming we don\u2019t make any changes in response to new tax legislation which we wouldn\u2019t do.", "So overall, we don\u2019t \u2013 we see any changes as being relatively modest. It actually is possible under certain scenarios for our tax rate to go up, but it doesn\u2019t go up that much. I think how a border-adjusted tax applies to services, the short answer is nobody knows.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Okay great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Greg Peters", "Good morning, thank you for the call. My first question is \u2013 centers around your comments around the Exchange Solutions segment. You talked about a global, a slowdown or a normalization in that business. Perhaps you could provide some additional color on that?", "John Haley", "Yes, sure. So, let me just mention Greg what\u2019s really going on here. The biggest part of the business we have right now is the retiree part of the business. And the retiree part of the business we\u2019ve been very fortunate. We\u2019ve gotten almost all of the really big cases that have gone on to the exchanges. We won almost every one of them. But there\u2019s, at some point you run out of, there\u2019s fewer and fewer of those big ones to go out.", "And so we did our largest client ever, we implemented last year. And of course that\u2019s what led to the big enrollments we have for this year and the big revenue growth. We don\u2019t have a similar really big one that we are implementing this year. We\u2019re still going to get up to 110,000 retirees because we are getting a lot of them; but the one client that accounted for I think it was 140,000, 145,000 retirees last year.", "So 110,000 is still a great result, but it doesn\u2019t make up for that one big client; so we\u2019re seeing that so down a little bit. I think what I would point to, and as Roger said, the active exchange is a smaller piece of the business. In the long run that\u2019s what we expect to be by far the dominant part of the business. Our growth rate was terrific there the last year, we really added a lot of folks. We\u2019ve already got four big clients signed up for 2018; so we are very enthusiastic about that, but that\u2019s a small part of the piece that\u2019s having that high growth rate.", "Greg Peters", "Thank you. And I know you have already commented in some other answers about the legacy OIP program, but if we could just step back and from a big picture perspective, I know periodically last year you expressed some frustration about the ability for these savings actually to fall to the bottom line. And perhaps now that you have a year under your belt you could provide some updated perspective on the legacy OIP program and what you think might be impactful as we think about 2017 and 2018?", "John Haley", "Let me make just two quick comments and then I\u2019ll turn it over Roger who I know will want to provide some more color. But I think we were \u2013 I think frustrated is the right word, that it was we had these good savings we were getting in OIP and for one reason or another they weren\u2019t dropping to the bottom line. And I think one of the things we said to the analyst and investor community was we were actually going to be focused less on what the top-line savings in OIP were, but really how are we going to be getting margin improvement? Are we going to be seeing things falling through there? In the last quarter Roger talked about our sequential expenses being down and I think he said at that time, this is too early for us to say this is a real trend and we will wait and see what happens in the fourth quarter.", "And as he just mentioned in his prepared remarks, I think the fourth quarter has come in and we have said, okay they are down again and we are seeing margin improvement. So we feel like that kind of a focus is paying off and we are seeing some results there. We\u2019re still not exactly where we would like to be, but I think we have seen parts of the operation, I think in Great Britain there was enthusiastic adoption of the OIP program, and we\u2019ve seen it have a very positive effect on margins there. So I think one of the things we want to do is take some of the learnings from that and apply them worldwide. Roger, maybe you want to add?", "Roger Millay", "The only thing John I would add to that is again refer to probably one of the changes in our remarks this time and that we both talked about financial discipline. And I think it fits what John said about our emphasis earlier in the year internally and externally just shifting more to really thinking about value or thinking on a more focused basis about value creation through margin enhancement in these programs.", "And it really seems, as we ended 2016, that was showing through in the financials. It\u2019s something that we emphasized in the budget process really challenging ourselves to find the levers, to see the enhancement as we go forward and know how we had to manage different parts of the business to make sure margin came through as a result of those cost programs. And I think the results now, as John said, are showing through in the margin line; so it bodes well I think for 2017.", "Greg Peters", "Thank you for your answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to drill down a little bit specific on the cost savings the three buckets there. I just want to make sure you mentioned that the integration savings will be $30 million in 2017 and $95 million from the OIP program and how much of that will drop to the bottom line? And also you have the business restructuring in HCB segment. How much savings will that be in 2017?", "Roger Millay", "Yes. I\u2019d say in terms of the individual amounts and consistent with what we just talked about on the last question, the drive here is to achieve a margin improvement. So we came in with 22.3%, I think we said EBITDA margin for 2016. We are guiding to 23% to 24%, so if you take the $30 million, plus the $95 million, plus some I don\u2019t know tens of millions of dollars, I don\u2019t have the specific number in front of me for the business restructuring, that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the overall margin improvement which is in that range, based on the range we gave you of around 100 basis points. Again without specifying by individual program, that\u2019s margin improvement obviously of somewhere around $80 million.", "Kai Pan", "Okay that\u2019s assuming there\u2019s no \u2013 constant top line right?", "John Haley", "Well actually we have \u2013 the reason we don\u2019t have every last dollar in there is because there\u2019s some cost on the top line.", "Kai Pan", "Okay great and my second question on the sort of free cash flow side, you guided about $500 million buyback in 2017. If you add about $300 million for the dividends, that\u2019s $800 million. That\u2019s pretty much the same free cash flow in 2016. I just wonder is there\u2013 either there is no growth in free cash flow or you plan to use part of free cash flow for other purposes?", "Roger Millay", "Yes. I mean, I think in general now that we are using round of hundreds of millions of dollars here, you are doing the numbers correctly. There are some other payments going out. We do have related to some past acquisitions some payouts of contingent consideration, so that\u2019s a little bit of an add to what you mentioned. But in general, we are circling call it available free cash, I don\u2019t know that anybody really uses that term, but maybe we made it up here. We are looking to target available free cash to pay back in share repurchases. That\u2019s roughly what we\u2019re trying to communicate.", "Kai Pan", "Any plans as far as would acquisition be a focus here or not?", "John Haley", "We would never want to rule out if there\u2019s some really attractive acquisition, but I think at the moment we think we\u2019re going to be hard put to find something that\u2019s more attractive than buying our own stock.", "Kai Pan", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Adam Klauber", "Hi, in the North American U.S. brokerage operation in 2016, did the level producers\u2013 was it pretty much flat, did it grow or did it decline? And how are you thinking about the level of producers in North America in 2017?", "John Haley", "Yes. The level of producers was lower at the end of 2016 than it was at the beginning. There\u2019s a number of moving pieces that occurred there. One is that we have some smaller accounts that we have transferred over to \u2013 we\u2019ve sort of sold some operations or we\u2019ve transferred them over under some agreements we have to some other operations and we lose some producers when we do that. We had some retirements. We had some folks who moved from producer to non-producer status where they are still managing clients but they are doing it in a different way. We did have some turnover among the producers.", "So we did have fewer producers at the end than at the beginning. At the end of the day, I think the turnover rate was about what \u2013 the voluntary turnover rate was about what we would have expected. I think going forward for 2017 we\u2019d expect to see an increase in the number of producers. We expect to have more producers at the end of the year than we have now.", "Adam Klauber", "Okay great and one follow-up. I\u2019m not sure if you said it, but how is organic running as a wholesale business and again do you expect that in 2017 to be better than the other parts of IRR?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, the wholesale business led by Miller was up in 2016 and we expect continued steady growth performance.", "Adam Klauber", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Mark Marcon", "Good morning. Nice to see the progress. I was wondering if you could just talk about a few things. One, you did a great job in terms of outlining the area of revenue synergies that you ended up seeing in 2016. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about the targeted revenue synergies that you would have at the highest point in your list and the highest aspirations for, for 2017 and 2018.", "John Haley", "Well, we have, so I think \u2013 let me just mention something about the revenue synergies too Mark. When I went through them, the revenue synergies are the run rate that we were expecting to get from selling these things. It\u2019s not the revenue synergies that necessarily occurred in the year. So for example, when I talked about the Exchange Solutions and the revenue synergies from the mid-market, we sell to mid-market. For the most part, they are going to be implementing January 1 that we\u2019re getting. So the ones we sold in 2016, we\u2019re getting the revenue in 2017", "Mark Marcon", "I fully appreciate that.", "John Haley", "But it\u2019s not revenue that you would have seen there. Likewise, even for like the large-company P&C, most of those were sold in the second half of the year and so you haven\u2019t seen much of the revenue increases there. So when we come to this as to where we\u2019d expect to be, I think generally we were, as I said, the revenue synergies, we expect it to be about 5% to 10% of what the ultimate run-rate goal was for the end of 2018; we expected to be there at the end of 2016. It\u2019s probably between about a third and 40% is where we would expect to be at the end of 2017.", "Mark Marcon", "That is great. And then can you just talk about the Exchange Solutions in terms of what you ended up seeing there with the four large clients that you\u2019ve got on the active exchange coming on in 2018? Any way to size that in terms of number of lives or scope and how you would think the momentum would build with those four getting announced?", "John Haley", "I think, we don\u2019t have an exact figure to give right now. I\u2019d say it will be over 100,000 for those lives for those four clients we have there. I think one or two of them we even talked about potentially whether they might decide to adopt in January 1, 2017, and I think, as we worked with them, it became clear that because of all the things they had to pull together as well as what we could have done, we probably could have adopted for January 1, 2017. But I think they wanted to make sure they had everything going well and we now have a very good plan with them.", "So we found that encouraging. I think it fits with the general theme that the larger companies, it\u2019s a longer time talking about it; it\u2019s more planning. Their organizations are more complex; I think they are more risk-averse about doing it, so you need to build in a longer process for that. But frankly, we feel very good about the enrollment season we had for what we\u2019re implementing for January 1, 2017, and we think this gives us a lot of momentum heading into 2018.", "Mark Marcon", "Great and if I can squeeze in two more. One would just basically be with regards to the uncertainty around the ACA, how would you expect that to end up impacting your healthcare consulting business here in the U.S.? And the second question would be totally different, but on the CRB side; when we think about Todd taking over and the recent fine-tuning of the management team under him, how\u2019s that \u2013 how do you expect just from a cultural perspective the adoption of a pay-for-performance kind of culture to translate to retention and performance? Thank you.", "John Haley", "Yes, thanks. The first one on the ACA, I mean, frankly ACA doesn\u2019t impact our typical client all that much. We, when we deal with it in the exchanges, we only deal with it in a few limited circumstances. When we deal with it in our consulting, some of our clients that have lower-paid folks that they don\u2019t want to provide healthcare coverage for or have a lot of part-time workers or something, it comes into it, but it\u2019s not the biggest part of what our \u2013 it\u2019s not a very large part at all of what our consulting does.", "So I think in general, changes there won\u2019t have a significant impact on our healthcare consulting business. Who knows maybe we\u2019ll get a few more questions about things. In the CRB business, I think one of the things I know you didn\u2019t get a chance to see Todd and Carl in person at Analyst Day, but you did get a chance to hear them over the phone. I think they are both individuals who really understand the segments that they are working with and leading.", "I think Todd commands great respect throughout the organization. I think people appreciate the fact that he has a long background in brokerage. I think they believe in his vision of the future, so I\u2019m as excited as can be to have him rolling out his program and leading that operation.", "Mark Marcon", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Yes, a few questions. First off, in your 2017 guidance are you including any impact from currency?", "Roger Millay", "Well, the guidance is based on the rates that I stated in my remarks. I think it was $1.24 for the pound and $1.08 for the euro. I think, I believe that\u2019s what we said.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay do you know what would that translate to just in bottom line in terms of EPS?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, I really don\u2019t have specific numbers. There isn\u2019t a huge impact for us EPS-wise with changes to the pound and the euro because we do have in the legacy businesses one of them was net in the P&L, net long pound; the other was net short pound. We do have profitability in the Euro so a little more exposure there, but big movements don\u2019t drive a lot of \u2013 or movements don\u2019t drive a big impact on EPS.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay and then in terms of the fourth quarter margins, I know on the last call we had mentioned there potentially being a lower level of incentive comp just as the revenue was you guys said a little bit lower than you would have expected for this year. Does that have an impact on the fourth quarter margins?", "Roger Millay", "Certainly, we do have a pay-for-performance system and we update that as the year goes on. There would have been a little bit of an impact in the fourth quarter, but not something that was a big driver.", "John Haley", "Not anything that was way out of whack, and in fact in, for the year we came in right in our range; we say in between 30% and 35% sort of our net operating income and we came right in there.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay and then in terms of the margin outlook for 2017, I know you guys, you did go through the components of the OIP and the merger-related savings that you expect to see fall to the bottom line, do you expect to see that even? I mean will we see more of the OIP savings fall to the bottom line within your Q1 margins, just how do you think about the projection of that kind of as we move through 2017?", "Roger Millay", "I think there is, in this being the last year of OIP and I think there is a push of getting all the possible activity done by the end of 2017. So I think OIP impact this year will be a little bit back-end loaded in the year. I think the cost savings from the merger cost savings, probably pretty even. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t think of a big kind of driver of early or late of any of those programs. The restructuring savings from the business of course occurred in the second half of 2016. So we will have the biggest impact on margins in the first half of the year.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay great and one more question if I may. Does your guidance for IRR assume a return to growth just within the reinsurance component of that segment in 2017? Or how are you thinking about the outlook for the reinsurance business?", "Roger Millay", "I think in our outlook the reinsurance business was roughly flat in the outlook.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you and, due to time, this does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. John Haley for any further remarks.", "John Haley", "Okay. Thanks very much everybody and we look forward to talking with you after our next quarter, our first quarter earnings call in May.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

My name is Sally, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Aida Sukys", "Good morning. Thank you, Sally. Welcome to the Towers Watson earnings call. I'm here today with John Haley, Towers Watson's Chief Executive Officer; and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please refer to our website for this morning's press release. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay via telephone for the next 2 weeks by dialing (617) 801-6888, confirmation number 63669286. The replay will also be available for the next 3 months on our website.", "This call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 that involves risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of forward-looking statements and the risks and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking results, investors should review the Forward-looking Statements section of the earnings press release issued this morning, a copy of which is available on our website at www.towerswatson.com, as well as other disclosures under the heading of Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.", "Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this earnings call.", "During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. For a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures under Regulation G to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release and the accompanying financial tables we posted on our website this morning.", "After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions.", "Now I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John J. Haley", "Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll review our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, as well as discuss some of our high-level expectations for the full year of fiscal 2014.", "Reported revenues for the quarter were $875 million, an increase of 6% over prior year reported revenues and up 4% on an organic basis. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 7%. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures.", "Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $169 million or 19.3% of revenues. The prior year fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $161 million or 19.5% of revenues.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.16, up 27% and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.36, up 9%. We're pleased with the overall results this quarter. While we've had some challenges in this difficult economic environment, the overall performance of the underlying business was strong.", "As we look at our accomplishments this fiscal year, a number of key milestones stand out from both an operational and market perspective. This year marked the official end of our merger and integration efforts with the completion of the implementation of the finance and HR ERP system. We accomplished the implementation on budget, on time and achieved our synergy goals.", "We enhanced our client development group outside of the U.S. to better align our organization with our multinational and global clients and expanded our global footprint into rapidly developing markets such as South Africa, India and Russia.", "We also had some great successes in the market this year. We led the market in helping companies with the derisking activities related to bulk lump sum projects; increased membership in the Retiree exchange by more than 80% during fiscal year 2013, exceeding our expectations on both revenues and profits; and launched OneExchange, our integrated health insurance exchange solution for active employees.", "We can't talk about our success this year without mentioning the integration of Extend Health as it more than exceeded our expectations. The underlying client service cultures of Extend Health in Towers Watson were very much alike, and the value proposition of the Medicare exchange was immediately recognized by our consulting businesses. The acquisition of Extend Health helped reposition our company into a high-growth area with outstanding results. It was also the catalyst for launching OneExchange.", "We've been very pleased with the response we've received from our national carriers, our clients and prospects. We've just completed a great sales season for the OneExchange offering for the 2014 enrollment season. Two clients will be utilizing our active exchange, and we expect that we'll be providing coverage to approximately 40,000 lives. Another very large employer will be utilizing our access exchange with plans to cover approximately 30,000 lives. We've been extremely pleased with the continued market demand for our ExtendRetiree offering. Last year, we enrolled more than 145,000 lives, and we anticipate the fall 2014 enrollment season to be even stronger. We'll also be offering our own 6,500 U.S. employees and their family members health care benefits through OneExchange this enrollment season.", "We're very proud of the OneExchange offering. Our consultants have worked closely with our national carriers in designing health care options that align closely with our clients' needs. As I look back at our accomplishments this year, I'm extremely proud of our associates. The teamwork they've shown in working through the ERP implementation and working across lines of businesses, developing thoughtful and holistic solutions for our clients has been exciting to see. This is exactly the culture we had hoped to foster as we form Towers Watson. On behalf of our senior leadership, I'd like to thank our associates for a great year.", "Now let's look at the performance of each of our segments. On an organic basis, Benefits grew 5%, Risk and Financial Services decreased by 5% and Talent and Rewards grew 2%. On a pro forma basis, Exchange Solutions grew 89%. For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $494 million. Benefits segment revenues were up 5% on a constant currency basis. All geographic regions showed solid revenue growth. Retirement revenues increased by 6% on a constant currency basis with 6% growth in both the Americas and EMEA regions. Valuation work deferred from the third quarter, as well as some bulk lump sum projects helped drive revenue growth in the U.S. this quarter. Higher commissions from Germany and legislative issues in Ireland helped drive revenue growth in EMEA. We did not expect the volume for bulk lump sum projects to be as high in FY '14 as it was in FY '13 and the work related to legislative issues in Ireland was completed as of June 30.", "Technology and Administration Solutions increased by 10% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to new client work in the U.K. and Germany. Health and Group Benefit were roughly flat on a constant currency basis as the refocusing of resources on designing and building an active employee health care benefit exchange dampened project activity. Going forward, the Benefits segment should show low single-digit growth, led by Technology and Administration Solutions and with Retirement experiencing more challenging comparables.", "Now let me turn to Risk and Financial Services. For the quarter, the Risk and Financial Services segment had revenues of $186 million. Revenues were down 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by Risk Consulting and Software. Risk Consulting and Software revenue declined by 14% on a constant currency basis. This line of business incorporates both software and consulting and the offerings posted very different results this quarter. Software revenues, which comprises about 17% of this line of business, increased by 9% on top of 17% growth in the FY '12 quarter 4. Consulting services, on the other hand, saw a sharp decline in discretionary client projects this quarter in EMEA. Consulting revenues were also down in the Americas, primarily due to a strong comparable when compared [Audio Gap].", "Globally, clients continue to be cautious with discretionary spending and there's very little M&A work in the insurance space at this time. Brokerage revenues grew by 8% on a constant currency basis. Revenue increases were driven by strong renewals and new business wins. Investment had 5% constant currency growth, led by the Americas. All its regions experienced growth this quarter. We continue to feel confident in the investment pipeline.", "Overall, we believe that Risk and Financial Services has moved into a more challenging environment. We anticipate discretionary spending continuing to affect the Risk Consulting and Software line of business. However, we see the investment business continuing to deliver strong growth.", "Now let's move on to Talent and Rewards. For the quarter, the Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $132 million, with revenues up 2% on a constant currency basis. The increase was driven by Rewards, Talent and Communication and the Data, Surveys and Technology lines of business. Rewards, Talent and Communication's revenue growth was driven by demand for communications work related to health care reform and other benefit changes in the Americas. Data, Surveys and Technology revenue growth was primarily related to software implementations in the Americas. Executive Compensation revenues were flat on a constant currency basis. Increased regulatory and governance activity in EMEA drove an increase in demand, which was offset by some slowness in Asia Pacific and the Americas, which is in a steady environment. We're seeing a pickup in several of the practice areas, including Data, Surveys and Technologies, with strong demand for technology solutions. The second half of the fiscal year is generally seasonally slower for Talent and Rewards.", "And last, I'd like to move to the Exchange Solutions segment. For the quarter, the Exchange Solutions segment had revenues of $35 million. On a pro forma basis, assuming we owned Extend Health for the entire fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, revenues grew by 89%. A strong enrollment season and a higher-than-expected retention rate helped drive membership levels to approximately 400,000. These factors contributed to exceeding our FY '13 revenue estimates. We feel very confident in the Exchange Solutions business and completed another very successful selling season.", "We had a strong fourth quarter and successful fiscal year. I'm excited about the engagement levels of our associates and what that means for the long-term future of our business.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger F. Millay", "Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone. I'd also like to add that I'm pleased with our fourth quarter results, which topped off a year of great accomplishment for Towers Watson. John noted many of these accomplishments, but I'd like to acknowledge 2 items that stand out for me: the successful completion of the implementation of the global ERP system; and the aggressive billing and cash collection effort, which allowed us to fully offset the receivable reserve challenges experienced in fiscal '12. The success of these efforts highlights the culture of teamwork and passion for delivering results that cascades throughout our organization in all aspects of our daily work, be it consulting projects or internal initiatives. I'd like to express my thanks to all of our associates who worked so diligently this year in helping us achieve this success.", "Now let's turn to the financial review. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles, resulting from merger and acquisition accounting costs.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had a 34% NOI margin, completing a year of record profitability. Risk and Financial Services had a 15% NOI margin. This is primarily a result of our top line challenges in the Risk Consulting and Software line of business, but we did incur some unplanned initial restructuring costs this quarter as well. Talent and Rewards had an 11% NOI margin in what is seasonally a softer quarter for them. Exchange Solutions had a 51% NOI margin.", "Net income attributable to controlling interests for the quarter was $83 million, adjusted net income was $97 million.", "The tax rate for the quarter was 34%, a bit below our forecasted rate of 35% to 36%.", "Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. At June 30, we had $461 million in cash available for our use. For fiscal '13, our free cash flow was $453 million as compared to $192 million for fiscal 2012. The year-over-year increase of $261 million or 136% was mainly a result of the collection of client receivables and the wind down of the IT and ERP system projects, resulting in lower integration costs and fixed asset purchases.", "We had no borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter. We paid down the $135 million balance that was outstanding at the end of last quarter.", "During this quarter, we did not purchase -- repurchase any shares.", "Now let's review our guidance for fiscal 2014. Today, we'll provide you with fiscal year 2014 first quarter guidance, as well as some context for our full year fiscal 2014 outlook. As a reminder, we'll provide full fiscal year guidance at our Analyst Day on September 20.", "One note before we review our Q1 guidance. Starting July 1, we've aligned our segment receivables reserving methodology with our GAAP reserving methodology in an effort to better align management reporting with GAAP reporting. This is also a step to streamline our accounting process as part of the completion of the ERP deployment and our focus on process improvement. This does not have an impact on the fiscal year '13 quarterly or annual total company results, but does have a minor impact on fiscal year '13 segment reporting.", "In order to put fiscal year '13 segment revenues on the same basis as our new fiscal year '14 reporting, we estimate that fiscal year '13 quarterly revenues would fluctuate less than $10 million, negatively or positively, and the margin impact for the smaller segments may differ by 1 or 2 percentage points. On an annual basis, we estimate that the total segment revenue impact would be less than $5 million, and margin changes would be negligible. Year-over-year segment analysis going forward will incorporate the new reserving methodology for both fiscal '14 and fiscal '13. We'll provide quarterly and annual schedules that reconcile the impact of the new segment reserving methodology at Analyst Day.", "For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect revenues will be in the range of $850 million to $870 million. On a constant currency basis, this correlates to a growth rate of 3% to 5%. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.20. Our EBITDA margin is expected to be around 18%. Please note that due to the completion of the integration efforts, we'll no longer be making adjustments to our EBITDA measure for reporting purposes.", "For the first quarter, our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of USD 1.50 to the British pound and an average exchange rate of USD 1.30 to the euro.", "For the first quarter, we expect the income tax rate to be around 35%. There are potential onetime adjustments, which could conclude in the first quarter and significantly lower this tax rate.", "We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 71 million.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share will continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share. However, this difference will continue to narrow somewhat now that the formal integration and transition period is complete. There will no longer be an adjustment for transaction and integration expense or merger-related stock-based compensation. Going forward, we'll continue to adjust for amortization of merger accounting intangibles and meaningful acquisition-related stock-based compensation.", "Now we'll review our fiscal year 2014 first quarter guidance for the segments. We expect constant currency revenue growth in the Benefits segment to be in the low single digits. As John noted, the Retirement business faces very strong comparables in fiscal '14 due to the bulk lump sum activity in fiscal '13. The NOI margin for Benefits is expected to be around 30%.", "Next, in the Risk and Financial Services segment, we expect constant currency revenue to decline by the mid-single digits. We expect the NOI margin to be in the mid-teens. We expect margins to be increased during the year as Risk Consulting -- Risk Consulting Services realizes the benefit of steps it has and continues to take to realign their businesses to reflect the current marketplace.", "In the Talent and Rewards segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the 2% to 5% range. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low to mid-20% range. Lastly, in the Exchange Solutions segment, we expect revenue growth of around 145%. The prior year first quarter included a deferred revenue -- write-off of $6 million, which was required by GAAP purchase accounting rules. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low single digits. As a reminder, Exchange Solutions' profitability is seasonally low in the first half of the fiscal year, particularly in a year like fiscal '14 where they have very significant enrollment activity.", "For fiscal year 2014 overall, we're expecting the levels of organic growth and EBITDA margin to be similar to fiscal year '13. Our comparables will be a bit challenging in the first half of the year in the Benefits segment due to the prior year performance of the Retirement business and in the Risk and Financial Services segment due to the performance of investments. While the economy appears to be stabilizing in Europe, we continue to manage that geography with caution. We're also cautious about potential economic slowdowns in Asia and particularly in China.", "As John mentioned, we continue to see some very positive momentum in Exchange Solutions and expect our Retiree exchange to maintain that momentum. We've been very pleased with the initial interest level for OneExchange.", "Overall, I'm pleased with our performance for the quarter and the year. It was a year of challenges, whether it was completing integration, consulting in the dynamic landscape of the Affordable Care Act or facing an uncertain global economic environment. As John mentioned previously, it took a great deal of teamwork to produce these strong results given these challenges. While not all the challenges are behind us, they've made us a stronger company, and we're well positioned for long-term growth and even greater successes.", "Now I'll turn it back to John.", "John J. Haley", "Thanks, Roger. And now, we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Ato Garrett.", "Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I had a question on -- you're looking at the pension liability and how that changed Q-on-Q. We thought that might actually come down a little bit further given how some of the assets have performed and the increase in discount rates. I was wondering if you can shed any more light on that.", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, I mean it came down quite a bit and so we did have good asset performance and, the discount rate is up. And I guess I can't say much more than where we landed reflects those changes. The other thing I will say is that the balance of funding overall for the plans has also driven up the asset side of the balance sheet and so that is in -- reflects one of the changes in other assets. So perhaps that's a part of -- in that mix, a part of what's not -- you're not seeing relative to what you hope for.", "Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And also relating to the related expense given -- the changes in the related expense relating to the increase in discount rate, is that going to have any impact on the '14 margins?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, it will drive pension expense down for fiscal '14 relative to '13. And it's not enough to drive kind of order of magnitude change in the margins, but that is a benefit that we have going into the year.", "John J. Haley", "And that can be offset by a reevaluation of our expected return on investment, too.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess, my question is -- I guess, my first question is with regards to the Benefits business. I know on a year-over-year basis the bulk lump sum business creates a tough comp challenge. Having said that, could you talk about sort of the longer-term potential from that trend because it seems to be quite a significant source of potential long-term upside?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, I think that's right, Ashwin. And as you know, we were very cautious about just projecting too much from the big blip up we had in the middle of the fiscal year as a result of all the bulk lump sum activity, but did say that we thought there was -- that this was something that would be a feature of landscape and we would see more employers looking to do this in the future. We still think that. I think we are -- we're still seeing projects -- we're still selling projects today, bulk lump sum projects, and there is an underlying level of activity that is still there. It's not nearly as high as it was in the second or third quarter, but there is still bulk lump sum project work. We're continuing to see employers do that even today. And I think as market conditions fluctuate, I think we'll see some -- maybe even see some spikes up in future years.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So you see that more as a response to market fluctuations then?", "John J. Haley", "Well, I think that helps is what happens. But I mean I think the fact that we're seeing an underlying basis of bulk lump sum projects even occurring in, say, this quarter and moving forward gives you an indication that it's an activity that's probably here to stay for a while. And if conditions are particularly ripe in the quarter, you might see a blip up.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, perhaps you guys can quantify at Analyst Day. Wanted to ask also about visibility into sort of Risk Consulting recovery. And failing a recovery, if results continue to be like this, would you consider strategic options potentially?", "John J. Haley", "No. I think the Risk Consulting and Software, when we look at that, it's got a lot of challenges right now, particularly in Europe. And a lot of that has been affected by the starting and stopping of Solvency II. I think that's been -- that's created a sort of a weariness, I think, among the insurance companies about just a lot of that activity. And as they've stopped it, they haven't turned to other projects. We haven't seen a lot of M&A there either. So all of that has meant that, particularly in EMEA, Risk Consulting and Software, the consulting part of it is facing quite a challenging environment. What we're focused on right now, and we've already taken some initial restructuring steps and everything, but we're focused on getting to the kind of margins we've had in the past. But this is a business that we're committed to and all of our businesses have some ups and downs from time-to-time and we just deal with them.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, understood. Last question, use of cash. You paid down the debt. I guess, you could get one of these notes again for '14 related to comp. But beyond that, I mean what's the use of cash? You did not really do a stock repurchase this quarter, M&A. I mean, could you talk more about that?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, I'd say looking forward, while we don't have anything specific to say right now as we look at fiscal '14, we do see that we have more free cash flexibility and flexibility based on what's on the balance sheet. And that while the ordering of our priorities, emphasizing flexibility per acquisition opportunities remains our first priority, we would expect in fiscal '14 to enhance return of cash to shareholders. But again, nothing specific yet on that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "John, it seemed to me that you were a little bit surprised by what happened in RFS in terms of the revenue just not coming in. Was there -- were there projects that you guys had that you were expecting to hit in the quarter even when you guys reported your earnings call last time that just kind of came back to you and were delayed? Can you just give us a little bit more detail on that?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, I think Shlomo, that there were some projects, particularly in Europe that were -- that we had anticipated that didn't go forward with clients. But overall, there just wasn't some -- as much new business coming through either as we thought. As we look at this, we don't think that this is something that is as much a Towers Watson issue as it is a market issue. So in other words, we think the market in EMEA for this type of work is just very slow right now. And as best we can tell, as we look at some of our competitors, they're experiencing similar kinds of issues. So I think it's just the kind of thing we'll have to manage through, but I don't think we're unduly worried about just what our offering is or anything like that. We feel confident in the longer run future of the business.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And if I understand your comments correctly in terms of making sure you have the business to be the size that you want it to be, is this similar to the situation you guys had a few years ago with Talent and Rewards and you just kind of reassessed what the demand was going to be and you kind of planned appropriately. It took a few quarters to work through that?", "John J. Haley", "I think it's exactly like that. That's what -- as I thought about it, Shlomo, that's exactly the way I've approached it.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then how much of the Benefits growth was from valuation work that was deferred from the prior quarter into this quarter?", "John J. Haley", "It's a little bit hard to tell. I had asked Gene Wickes, who's the Head of Benefits, for a rough estimate of that and he'd said about 0.75%. So it's in the low -- mid-single-digit millions of dollars probably.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then Exchange Solutions seems to be like knocking the cover off the ball. And last week, you guys announced the contract with the CMS. Can you talk about potential addressable population size that's incremental to you through that contract? And anyway you can quantify, I know it's very early stages, but at least some populations that you think are now able to be addressed by you guys?", "John J. Haley", "Well, I think in terms of the populations that we could potentially address, I mean we tend to focus, obviously, on the larger employers. That's where we think we offer the greatest advantage for them. We don't have any really good estimates of exactly how many people we think are going to move into the exchanges or potentially be addressed by those. But we think depending on what kind of movement there is among employers to exchange, we expect to get a large portion of that market. We think we have an extraordinarily competitive offering. And so when we look at what large employers are looking for in the exchange market, we expect to do very well there. The kind of thing we signed with the federal government facilities, that's something that again we think we're a bit of a leader in terms of providing this.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So it's kind early on is what it sounds like for that?", "John J. Haley", "I think it's early on. I mean, the question is, Shlomo, we have the ability, we believe, to ramp up to as big as the market gets for any of this. We don't think -- obviously, if every employer decided to switch in 2015, we wouldn't be able to handle that but we think the market will develop over time. And we expect to be able to handle a very large portion of the market.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just a couple of questions for Roger and I'll get off. Free cash flow expectation for fiscal year '14, are there any major pension contributions in cash this year?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, we'll continue to make pension contributions. They may be a little bit lower in '14 than in '13. But I think in terms of overall free cash flow, we would say that we should now be in the stabilized post-integration mode of expecting free cash to be somewhere in the neighborhood of adjusted net income.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then the $160 million sequential step-up in non -- other noncurrent assets, did that have to do with adjustments in the pension assets?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, it did.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of business Tim McHugh.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "First, I wanted to go back to some of the comments about the Exchange business and more so the Retiree business. You threw out some numbers there that went by me pretty fast, but I thought you said 145,000 people you added last year to the Retiree. And if I heard correct, you expect to add even more in the upcoming enrollment period. Did I get those things correct?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, you got those correct.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then for the active employee options, I guess, can you give us a little more color on the -- I know you won't tell us the names of the clients, but were these existing Retiree clients? Are these people looking at it for the first time and then Exchange Solution first time? I guess just some more color on who you're attracting to the Exchange.", "John J. Haley", "Yes, so if we look at this, we have 3 clients that are the Actives or the Access. The Actives are going to be about 40,000 covered lives. The client that is in the Access has about 30,000 covered lives. We -- 2 of the clients are new to Towers Watson and one was an existing client.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And as we think about the growth, is 400,000 roughly the right base level for the existing number of enrollment?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, it is. For the Retiree exchange.", "John J. Haley", "Yes.", "Roger F. Millay", "That's the number, that's right.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one last question. The impact on the health benefits consulting business, can you elaborate a little bit more, was demand weaker or was it just that you didn't have the supply of people because they were busy, I guess, doing non-billable time helping people think through the exchanges?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, I mean we think we deployed a number of our consultants in HGB on the design of our overall -- the design of OneExchange, in working with the carriers to design how that was all going to operate and then in talking to clients about exchanges and what they might want to consider there. So we saw that, that's one of the reasons we didn't have the same kind of growth in HGB as we've seen in some of the more recent quarters. I think we'll see that occur. We still had very good profitability in HGB of course, so we kept that up. But I think we'll see some of that occurring throughout the remainder of this calendar year and maybe even throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. But the HGB, that part of it is a very big part of the exchanges in really driving a lot of the intellectual capital around that.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "So does that mean you would expect -- that you wouldn't expect much growth out of that piece because they're going to continue to -- they have to talk to a lot of clients about this?", "John J. Haley", "It's one of the reasons, yes. As we talked about the growth rate for the benefits overall, that was reflected in there. A little bit lower growth for HGB as a result of that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Jeff Volshteyn.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just following up on Extend questions. Can you just, from a high-level perspective, can you help us understand the relative economics of you participating in private and public exchanges as well as some announcements that came out recently that some insurance are leaving federal exchanges? What are some of the dynamics there? If you can just give us a little color, that'd be helpful.", "John J. Haley", "Well, Exchange Solutions is not really -- exchange Solutions is something that offers -- it doesn't deal with the federal exchanges or anything like that. These are where clients come in and are electing to go through our exchange and replace usually their Retiree medical plans. And it's not affected by some of those dynamics.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then the difference in the economics perhaps between the active and retiree market, are you able to sort of quantify, I know it's early, but what are the directions there and perhaps maybe the selling cycles?", "John J. Haley", "Well, I think the actives are -- will be part of the OneExchange platform that we have. That's what we mentioned we're starting in 2014 -- as of January 1, 2014. We have first few clients we're going to implement for that in 2014, and then we'll be expanding that -- beyond that. The selling season for 2015 has probably already started now, and so we're beginning to talk to clients about what they might want to do there. For the Retiree exchanges, as we mentioned, we've now finished the selling season for 2014 and we're beginning to implement them. We expect to implement more this coming year than we did last year. And so we feel pretty confident about our offerings in both cases.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's helpful. And just a clarification question on 2014, Roger. Should we think about the amortization adjustment for 2014 to be similar to that in 2013 or there are some changes there?", "Roger F. Millay", "Boy, I would say broadly, on the amortization of the intangibles, I would expect it to be similar. To be honest with you, I haven't specifically looked at that. As we get into the next few years, we probably will start to see some of the specific intangibles that we're amortizing. They didn't all have-- they do not all have the same lives, so some will start to drop off, but I don't think there's a significant drop in '14. But I'd have to go back and look at that more specifically if that was important.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Let me perhaps rephrase it, your indication of margins, EBITDA margins, to be similar, is that on a GAAP basis or adjusted basis?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, so yes, and I'll apologize for the intricacies I suppose of our P&L. But one of the key points I think that I said is that there will no longer be adjustments that will affect the EBITDA line. So EBITDA is for fiscal '14 is GAAP EBITDA. Because the main adjustments integration costs and the stock-based compensation, those both ended in fiscal '13.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Curious how you would see a little bit higher interest rate environment impacting the business?", "John J. Haley", "I think the one thing you think about with the higher interest rate environment is pension plans get better funded. And there's some question as to does that lead to more settlements or maybe there's some more bulk lump sum. The lump sums are a little bit cheaper. I think, one of the things that happens though is that even though the -- it's really the opportunity cost of what happens versus offering lump sums versus what you could do if you kept the money yourself. So I'm not sure if that changes a real lot. But we might see a little bit more in the bulk lump sum issue.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Roger, what do you think the opportunity is to improve the tax rate? And where we might be able to get it in a few years?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, where the tax rate has been and will be going has been very dependent on specific integration type activity that gives the opportunity to drive the rate down. So for those of you who have been watching closely, and I recognize maybe not everybody watches taxes all that closely, but we have seen a nice gradual decent in what we expected for the steady state tax rate over the past year, maybe 1.5 years. We think that will continually -- we'll continue to gradually see that decline in the steady state into the next couple of years, I guess, I'd say. Legacy Watson Wyatt had run, I don't know, I'll say, and this is without specifically looking at it, but maybe around 33% or so. That's something that we had early on in the integration had hoped that we could get the rate down to that level. But we seem to be on our way, but we're not ready to say that that's an achievable steady rate. One of the problems, of course, with the tax rate is you have kind of a steady state underlying rate and then every year, you have one-off things that either push that up a little or push it down. So this year's rate was a little lower, this year being fiscal '13 because we did have, if you recall, in the second quarter, a positive adjustment as a result of the consolidation of legal entities in Australia. Don't know if we'll have another item like that or if we'll have an item that pushes the other way next year. Other than, as I said in my remarks, there are some items kind of maturing here in the September quarter that give pretty significant upside actually to the tax rate. So long way to say volatility, but over the next couple of years, we continue to hope for some gradual continued improvement.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "One question on the exchange business. You mentioned that the selling season for 2015 has already started, perhaps for the OneExchange in terms of conversations. Is that earlier than it had been when you first focused more exclusively on retirees, or is that a similar sort of time line to how conversation evolved headed into the selling season?", "John J. Haley", "No, what I was referring to is that, obviously, implementations are close for 2014 at this point. So any discussions you have now of necessity have to be for 2015.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I'd like to ask a little bit more about the Exchange Solutions. So you've obviously had very strong growth there. We've got a ton of questions with regards to Exchange Solutions, so despite the fact that you've done a couple of presentations on it, it's still not well understood. As it relates to the Retiree side, can you talk little bit about what you've seen thus far as you brought clients on board? Can you talk about whether or not you're bringing entire clients en masse in terms of if you sign the client if all of their retirees switch over all at once, or are they coming over in segments? And you gave us a projection for this first quarter, but can you give us a sense for what sort of investments you're making in that area that would give us a sense for when we have the next step up?", "John J. Haley", "So, let's see, I guess what I'd say about the -- first of all, when we bring the clients on, generally we're bringing on all of their retirees. Although if you have clients that have different populations like we've talked with clients about bringing on their hourly employees different than the salaried as sometimes they're covered by different plans, so that might occur. But generally, we're bringing them on all at once. I'd say there's 2 things that have -- we've seen from this. One is the very high quality in the deliverables. We have -- what we got with that Extend Health brought to us when we joined our organization and what we have now in extend solutions -- Exchange Solutions is extraordinary quality processes that really drive the whole process. And that resulted high levels of satisfaction among the employers -- among the retirees and then hence among the employers. One of the things that's great about us is we could use any one of our clients as a reference for other clients. So that's something that we're really proud of, and it's something that we look to take forward as we expand this. We've had -- we had some pretty high growth projections when we brought Extend Health into the family here and we've exceeded those. It's going to be -- I don't think we're going to continue to grow at 89%, so we'll see that coming down somewhat. But we have, by far, the largest share of the market here, and we actually think we can expand on that.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "That's great. And is your sense of the addressable market as it relates to the Retiree side any different than what you thought it was a few months ago? And how quickly that addressable market would get converted over to Exchange Solutions? How has that evolved?", "John J. Haley", "No, I think the addressable market is not really any different than we thought it was to begin with. I do think one of the things that -- this is a business where if you get a large client in a year or 2, it can make a significant difference. So we think there's an underlying growth rate that we can get year after year. And then if you get a big client on top of that, it really bumps it up. And that's what's happened in each of the last couple of years is we've had a few big clients, extra big clients, come in that have really helped us. And I think -- but I do think there's a good size underlying growth rate that will continue.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then it sounds like on the active side, it sounds like things have evolved a little bit faster than what you initially indicated. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there in terms of having 3 clients that are signing up in one form or another?", "John J. Haley", "No, I think we're really pleased with that because it's about the right level for us to make sure. As I mentioned, one of the things we're committed to is making sure that we continue with the high-quality deliverable, and with very high satisfaction among our clients. So these are 3 good-sized clients that we can work on delivering them to, and we think that it will provide a great base for us to expand from in the future. And of course, we're doing it for ourselves, too.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Sure. And then can you talk a little bit about the CapEx for this coming year relative to the last fiscal year? Obviously, you've gone through the integration with the Towers Perrin side, so that's all set, but it sounds like you're expanding quite a bit here.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, I don't -- we'll talk about that, more specifically, in September at Analyst Day. But I don't expect any significant increase at this point over what we had in fiscal '13. Probably a little bit higher, but not as high as it was in fiscal '12.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then 2 quick ones, with regards to Risk Consulting and Software there, is it your sense that because of the fits and starts on Solvency II that, that situation is likely to continue for the foreseeable future and therefore we just need to rightsize it? Or is it -- do you sense that eventually that will get streamed out and demand will come back?", "John J. Haley", "I think it's a little bit in between those, Mark. I think -- I do think that eventually demand will get back and we'll get through that. But as I mentioned, we've already looked at some -- we've already taken some initial restructuring steps. And so we need to make sure we have things aligned to what the business is right now and as we develop it in the future. So we feel -- we still continue to feel very good about the long run prospects of this business, but we need to make sure we're at the right place at the current stage, too.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then lastly, on HBP, what's the impact on the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act being delayed by 1 year? Are you -- did you staff up and then now we're -- it's going to be a little bit slower, or do you think it just drags up the process even longer and provides more consulting opportunities?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, we actually don't think that's going to have a significant impact at all on our clients or any of our projections.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins.", "Brian T. Davis - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Brian in for Sara Gubins. So quick question on Technology and Administration Solutions. Can you just describe just the general client work, have you been seeing several clients and what type of work and kind of the duration? Are we talking longer-term projects or more shorter-term work?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, so I think in the U.S., the kind of work we do for Technology Administrative Solutions tends to be around both pension and health care plans. In the U.K., it tends to be more -- in Germany, it tends to be more pension related. In all cases, most of the work is multi-year contracts, so 3 to 5 years, probably 5 years is maybe a little more common, but it's somewhere in that range.", "Brian T. Davis - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, sounds good. And then with regards to Exchange business, I mean, I know you talked about it a few times. But just to clarify, were you guys seeing any kind of loss of business in the aggregate from people who were kind of delaying projects because they were looking and considering your Exchange versus others? And just any kind of thoughts around that process?", "John J. Haley", "There are other exchanges? So no, we haven't seen anything. We haven't seen anything like that. I think -- this is a growing field, so it's not like we're seeing anything like that.", "Operator", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to John Haley for closing remarks. Thank you.", "John J. Haley", "Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing you at Analyst Day on September 20 and reviewing our first quarter results with you in November.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Kerry Calaiaro, who is the Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Kerry Calaiaro", "Thank you, and welcome to our second quarter 2010 earnings conference call and webcast. Our call today is hosted by Joe Plumeri, Willis Group Holdings' PLC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ", "A replay of the call will be available through August 29th, 2010 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time by calling 888-568-0518 from within the US or 1203-369-3480 from outside the US. No pass code is needed.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.", "I'll now turn the call over to Joe", "Joe Plumeri", "Thanks, Kerry and good morning everybody. Welcome and thank you for joining us today on our call. On the call with me today are Grahame Millwater, the Group President; Stephen Wood, the Group Controller; Mike Neborak, as you know who we announced who will be our CFO, has been with us a couple of weeks. He had a long planned family vacation this week and since this is a family operation, we said go ahead and take care of your family. So he is on a vacation with his family. And as usual, the rest of the senior management team of Willis is here and we will be very glad to answer any questions that you might have.", "I am very happy with the results that we have delivered today. Especially the outstanding growth that we continue to generate as a result of our strategy of investment, while still watching our expenses and getting out of those investments, the growth that you saw in the quarter.", "The environment though remains very tough. In the US, we have not seen evidence of sustained recovery yet. Economies and a number of other countries where we do business also remain under considerable pressure.", "And the rate environment is still as you all know, very soft and unlikely to change significantly through the remainder of 2010, in the absence of a major loss activity. With these headwinds, we still delivered though which is I'm really proud about.", "Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was up 4% to $0.54 including $0.03 of favorable FX. 4% organic growth in commissions and fees in this environment is an outstanding achievement driven by international and global segments compares well with the 1% a year ago and 3% in the first quarter. So dramatic again results by growing organically internally.", "We continue to generate strong growth through new business across all our segments, 16% for the quarter which is one of our better quarters in terms of growth through new business, which again is an indication that our investment and our internal growth strategies, pipelines are working plus very, very solid client retention.", "Shaping our future, net benefits of $13 million in the quarter, Grahame's is going to talk about that, that's become a way of life in this company and we're going to continue to do that.", "Adjusted operating margin of 21.4%, which is increase of 20 basis points. For the past several years, we have right-sized, we have integrated and taken quite a bit of expense out of our cost base and still delivered solid margins.", "As we continue to watch expenses, we still need to make investments to fund growth which is what we've been doing, which is what this quarter I think is a manifestation of and you see that coming through organic growth.", "As an example, we started Willis Capital Markets that was an example of the investment we made. We made that investment about a year ago. We hired 25 people to begin that investment bank and as a result, inside of one year it's already paid for itself and contributed 1% and also 4% organic growth to this quarter. So that's a great example of investment and getting the organic growth. We took the shot, we made the investment, it was the right one to make. We are very proud of what that group has done and has many opportunities in the pipeline as this market stays soft and the opportunity for consolidation and doing a lot of work could afford us a lot of possibilities. ", "When you look at this for the first half of the year, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 7% to $1.80, including $0.09 of favorable FX. 4% total organic growth in commissions and fees, so the half and the quarter were the same. Shaping our future, the net benefit was $26 million, the gift that keeps giving, something that we began three, four years ago, started it from scratch. Again an initiative that we created internally and continues to do well for us. Adjusted operating margin of 27.3%, an increase of 150 basis points from a year ago.", "Now let me talk about some of the segments, first of all North America. North America is operating in a tough economy. With lower exposures it's interesting, I've been doing this for ten years at Willis and for the first time I hear everybody talk about exposures, I never talked about exposures before, and I guess the reason is because they are lower. ", "People are buying less insurance. So if you take the two headwinds, we should probably make up an index, which is the headwind of the lower rate and the headwind of less exposures, it comes out to be a high number. It's probably close to 10%. By the way the exposure number is unscientific. I've asked insurers and they told me that exposure units are down in the 9% - 10% range; you add the soft market to that, which in the quarter was 4%.", "So you are getting up there pretty good. So anybody that's coming in around one like we did in the first quarter, flat or a little better than that is driving it's growth through a lot of new business and a lot of retention, which is I think the story of North America and a comparison over year-to-year basis.", "Organic commissions and fees were down 1% in the second quarter with 3% net new business and a four point rate headwind as I said earlier that's a pretty big headwind. There are good numbers behind this headline, our producers are generating new business growth in the teens, and client retention remains solid.", "So you're growing here in the teens, your retention is solid, you've still got these headwinds and you're still coming in around where we are is pretty good result, more than pretty good results, an outstanding result, I think given the environment especially coming off of a integration and all the things that we had to do that others did not.", "The organic decline is a significant improvement on top of that from the negative 8% that we recorded in the second quarter a year ago while we were focused on the HRH integration. ", "So you go from my state to (inaudible), again we look at that as terrific, terrific improvement and when I look at the now the concentration on the pipelines as I have meetings in North America with Don and with the national partners, we're feeling very good about the future.", "Our employee benefit business which is our largest practice area was up 2% in the quarter, which is again a good result considering unemployment remains close to 10% in North America. Construction, which is our second largest practice, was still down single-digits. Again, reflecting the on going challenges in that area from the slow economy.", "So as we said last quarter, where we specialize, we do better and we have seen positive results from some of our specialty practice areas this quarter, including technology and telecom, mining and utilities. In addition, for year-to-date, both healthcare and mining, were up double digits. So when you look at all of these things on a large basis and you step back from what's going on today with regard to economy and the rates, the progress in North America I think has been stunning.", "We noted by the way in the press release $2.9 million favorable impact from a one time accounting adjustment related to the HRH acquisition within the specialty businesses. This was a revenue item and impacted organic growth.", "The North American operating margin was 20.5%. If you exclude the pension curtailment gain in the year ago quarter we would have had around a 90 basis point margin expansion in North America, which as I said, given all the circumstances, is just an outstanding job and we are very happy with the direction of North America.", "International, organic growth in commissions and fees was 8% for the quarter and 6% year-to-date. That's another gift that keeps giving. Our international division has just been stunning. They keep doing a fantastic job, quarter-after-quarter. The new business generation remains double digits and the segment has floated about a 3% rate headwind.", "Again, you've got some countries in international as you know especially the Eurozone that aren't doing well, 3% rate headwind, but still growing at 8% organic growth is scheduled to be the best in the business and we are very proud of that as well. This is great result, shows the strength of this operation as the number of the economies are still challenged, as I said before.", "We recorded double digit growth in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe with contributions from China and Indonesia and Asia, Brazil, Chile and Latin America and Russia in Eastern Europe. ", "Given the weakness of UK and Continental Europe economies, we were pleased, and I want to underscore this, very pleased, that our UK division returned a positive growth.", "So our retail offices in the UK were positive for the first time in a long time which probably shows a lot of things, a lot of growth, growth through new business, retention of accounts and we're proud of that. Growth in Europe was positive as well, led by Switzerland, Spain and Italy and you'll noticed I said Spain and Italy, both economies, especially Spain are doing well, which really shows the underlying strength of those businesses in those countries.", "International margin expanded modestly to 23.5%, but again we are in the mood of making investments. We got good operations internationally, I think the best around, and we are going to feed it. ", "The worst thing we can do is to kill the golden goose. We are not going to do that. We restrained expenditures as you know very, very well. We've watched what we spent over the last couple of years but when it's time to invest, we are going to invest. That's what we are doing and that's why you see growth of 8% and say to yourself, why isn't the margin expanding, that's the reason, because this is not just for today, this is for tomorrow and the next day, and the next day after that.", "Our global businesses segment comprised of global specialties, Faber & Dumas, Willis Capital Markets and Advisory reinsurance had another excellent quarter with 7% organic growth and a relatively flat rate impact, which means that all of our businesses outside the US and we talked about why the US was the way it is, was up 7% or more which I think is again, an outstanding achievement. ", "Global is also up 7% on year-to-date business. Each of the business lines in global generated double digit new business growth. Global specialties reported strong growth in the quarter, led by financial and executive risks and energy. Strong growth resulted from new business generation and the investments we have made. Wins were distributed across the businesses and the geographies.", "Willis Capital Markets was the largest contributor, I talked about that. To the segments growth this quarter, in part due to their role as you all know in leading the Harper point transaction. So we are really happy with the progress by this relatively new business unit, not relatively, it is new. It is a transaction oriented business. So the results are going to be variable and lumpy on a quarter-to-quarter basis but we really have real excitement over the future.", "Reinsurance continues to post modest growth with strong new business levels overcoming the headwinds of clients retaining more risk and rates being down. So they continue to show positive growth again, another piece of business area that we'll particularly proud of, strong growth in the London market specialty areas, especially marine and aviation, and despite the high loss levels earlier in this year, rates remain soft as I said, except for marine and energy.", "The global margin declined. It's almost funny to say decline, but declined to 31.8% primarily due to foreign currency translation impact on our London market business, excluding FX, global margin expanded about a point.", "So all of our businesses across the board continue to do well, we are a global broker. We are investing in the expansion of our business. I will talk a little bit more about that in the end, but that expansion is coming from internal growth organically.", "Now I'll like to turn things over to Grahame Millwater to update you on the priorities for 2010. Grahame?", "Grahame Millwater", "Thank you, Joe. The quarter is again a reflection of our continual focus on delivering organic revenue growth. The 4% organic revenue growth in an ongoing difficult economic and insurance rate environment is a testament to our continued progress of new business development, retention and investments.", "Let me firstly touch on growth and rather than repeat the overview of our growth programs that I outlined on last quarter's call let me just focus on a few specifics. ", "In the middle market, we're developing a unique industry focused sales process with supporting analytics and technology, which we're calling sales 2.0. We believe this will improve the ability of our sales and client relation associates to deliver value and differentiate themselves at the point of sale. We will endeavor to pilot and fully develop this by the end of 2010 with a rapid rollout globally in 2011.", "We're rolling out our commercial network franchise model that has been such a success for us in the UK retail small commercial sector to several countries in Europe and the emerging markets. This provides product and effective access to markets to small select retail brokers and is profitable line for Willis.", "We have also built new facultative reinsurance platforms including teams in Latin America, North America, Europe and globally playing to unique integrated culture. This has delivered double digit revenue growth in the call facultative unit in the second quarter and could be a significant driver of revenue going forward.", "Joe has mentioned Willis capital market and advisory and this has been a great addition to our business. It has a good pipeline of potential transactions, and in this environment; we certainly see no sign of merger and acquisition activity slowing. So these are just some examples of how we have and are investing for current and future growth.", "Let me turn to briefly shaping our future. The key drivers of shaping our future benefits over the past two year have been our focus on client profitability and enhanced original commissions.", "These initiatives have become a way of life now with those activities largely embedded in the individual businesses. The next phase, shaping up is where we start to drive increased benefit from our long-term program of technology. ", "In the first half of 2010, we delivered gross benefit from the shaping of future program of $46 million and next benefits of $26 million.", "And lastly, let me just turn briefly to funding growth. We continue to manage the expense base to fund in our growth efforts. If you exclude the pension curtailment adjustment in 2009, our underlying growth in operating expenses was approximately 1%. This includes about 250 clients facing new hires and continued investment in our growth platform and new technology.", "This exercise is a reflection of our continual process of addressing non-value adding cost and transferring those dollars to investing in revenue generating assets and/or processes old technologies to generate further efficiencies going forward.", "Now, I would like to turn it over to Steven to review the financials.", "Stephen Wood", "Thank you Grahame. Good afternoon or good morning everybody. Turning to earnings, reported earning from continuing operations in the second quarter were $89 million, or $0.52 per share. On an adjusted basis reported earnings were $0.54.", "Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency, adjusted earnings per share were $0.51 compared with $0.48 in the second quarter of 2009, if you exclude the US pension curtailment gain.", "Turning to the operating margin. Reported operating margin was 21.2%, in second quarter '10 with adjusted operating margin of 21.4%. The adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points, through strong growth in commissions and fees, continued focus on expense management of funding growth and making investments as John had mentioned, favorable operating FX of 140 basis points. Lower corporate segment expenses were primarily due to the lower year-on-year hedging losses.", "Expenses. Salary and benefits were $456 million, 57.1% of total revenue in the current quarter. That compares to $443 million, or 56.5% in the year ago period. ", "Salary and benefits in the year ago quarter included the $12 million curtailment gain. As we said last quarter, we have a cash retention program in place. The cash payments are made in the first quarter and then amortized over a period, currently three years.", "In the second quarter 2010, salaries and benefits included $32 million, of expenses related to the amortization of cash retention awards, compared to $26 million in the year ago quarter.", "Reported other expenses were $135 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $139 million, in the year ago quarter, reflecting our on going strict controls of costs.", "Foreign exchange, operational FX had a positive $0.03 per share impact on EPS and a positive 140 basis points on adjusted operating margin compared to the second quarter of 2009. ", "The weakening of the euro against the dollar negatively impacted revenue due to the overweight of euro revenues. The weakening of the sterling against the dollar, positively impacted margin and earnings per share due to the overweight of sterling expenses.", "Tax items, reported income tax expense for second quarter '10 was $35 million, compared to $31 in the year ago quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.3%, and for the six months was 26.4%. The underlying tax rate for both the quarter and the first six months was 26%, the same as 2009 full year rates.", "Turning to pensions, our UK, US and international pension plans had a combined deficit of around $120 million at the end of 2009, and around $50 million at the end of second quarter 2010. We expect to make $124 million total pension contribution payments in 2010. Currently estimate 2010 pension expense at around $40 million.", "Finally looking at debt and capital management. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $2.3 billion, down from the $2.4 billion at the end of the first quarter and down slightly from December 31, 2009.", "In line with typical seasonality during the second quarter, we paid down parts of the revolver that we've drawn in the first quarter and have a mandatory term loan payment of $27 million.", "Looking at cash usage for the remainder of 2010, debt repayment remains our priority. We have mandatory term loan repayments of $27 million per quarter, and have just made final bond maturity payment of $83 million in July. Cash and cash equivalence were $139 million at the end of the second quarter.", "With that, I will now turn you back to Joe Plumeri. ", "Joe Plumeri", "Thank you very much, Steven. So we have continued to invest in and grow our business and this quarter shows that we are delivering. Our strategy is not a strategic acquisition strategy. We are not in the acquisition business at this time. ", "We are in the business of reducing our debt, making investments internally and growing our top line and building a great business over time that's what we're doing. That is our strategy and we think it's working quite well.", "With your organic growth in commissions and fees are up 4%, up from 3% in the first quarter and 1% a year ago, we think that's pretty good. North America has significantly improved organic revenue growth from a negative 8, as I said before, a year ago to now negative. ", "Internal segment continues to grow and national segment continues to grow. A testament to geographic diversity and presence in emerging markets where again; we've invested a great deal. A lot of investment internationally and that's paying off. ", "Global has expanded. With our young capital markets and advisory business that's developing nicely and even while we invested in the business, we have continued to improve our margin. So we'll continue to invest in the areas that we believe will drive future growth and margin expansion, we'll stay the course, and we think it's working well.", "Now I'll be glad to take any questions that you may have. Operator, you are in.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Keith Walsh from Citi. Your line is open.", "Keith Walsh - Citi ", "First question would be around the $2.9 million accounting benefit related to HRH. Could you just give us a little more detail around that? And then in relation to that, did that flow through the commission and fee line and did that impact your North America organic growth?", "Joe Plumeri", "Yes it's basically, what it is, it represents I guess a percent. It is organic. It represents as percent Keith, and a penny. ", "Keith Walsh - Citi", "Okay. And then the second question would be around the $3 million after tax loss on disposal. Can you just give us a little bit more color around that? Was that one operation or is it several?", "Stephen Wood", "Keith, its Steven. That was several operations and disposals. ", "Keith Walsh - Citi", "Is that an unusually high number relative to what you usually see in a quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense for it that you highlighted in the press release. ", "Stephen Wood", "It depends on disposals, Keith. But no it's unusual for the disposals that we did. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Jay Gelb, Barclays Capital. ", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "", "Hi. My first question has to do with the investments going forward. I believe the adjusted margin benefited pretty meaningfully from foreign exchange. So I want to get to that in a sec, but on a normalized basis, should we anticipate further margin expansion as Willis continues to makes investments in the business? ", "Joe Plumeri", "Yes, we are always looking to expand margin. The question is how much is the margin going to expand. This is not a suggestion that because we're investing in the business that's an excuse for the margin to go backwards. That's not what we are saying. We are simply saying that when you get it, which today is enormous revenue growth like 4%, that's enormous, and you see modest margin expansion, you ask the question what happened to all the margin. And I am telling you what happened to it is we invested in the business, because that's what we do.", "We're trying to grow the business. We are not making big acquisitions. We are staying the course. We are growing organically, we're growing pipelines. We have sales programs like Sales 2.0 which is a big initiative across the world and the middle market. We made investments in the capital markets. We are recruiting people, we're making investments in international, and so on and on and on and on.", "So, instead of just growing the margin and bringing all that to the bottom line and not making investments for next month and tomorrow and next year, we feel very good about what we are doing, but at no time do we suggest that because we are making those investments, that our margins should be reduced. It's just not going to expand in a dramatic fashion like that kind of spread suggests.", "You got to remember that the retention award is another investment. It's an investment in our people. That's why we did that. So to retain them in a world where everybody is coming after your people and in a time when business has not been good and we've been through a tough time, we felt that the best thing to do was to invest in our people rather than go out and buy other people. And that's what we did. And so that's all a part of this thing we call an organic growth strategy and that's what I am going to do. ", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak. Your line is open. ", "Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak", "Last quarter you discussed your balance sheet and the potential for resuming share repurchases sometime in the second half of this year. On this call, I'm hearing a lot of emphasis on making new investment. So, I am wondering if you still think that there may be room for reinitiating share repurchases later this year or if that's more of a 2011 or 2012 prospect. ", "Joe Plumeri", "Well, we said later this year, early next year, I even made the comment don't hold me to December 31 or January 1. So let's call it around that timeframe work. Yes, that's still the same. I said that earlier. We still want to pay down debt and then we want to buyback stock and we are taking operating expenses and we're using that to invest in the business. That's exactly what we're doing. That strategy has not changed. ", "Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak", "Okay. And a totally unrelated question that confuses me, that in having so much new business growth, are you seeing a higher sort of general customer churn taking place in the marketplace? That is everybody's new business going up you happen to be keeping more of it than the other insurance brokers, but there is more customer shopping for different brokers? ", "Joe Plumeri", "That's tough to be scientific about, I can't tell you that. All I know is that when you have 16% new business growth in North America, its well in to the teens, and your retentions are pretty good. That usually means that you're going to get good growth. I like to think that it's less shopping in a soft market, although that happens to a better value proposition. ", "Our pipelines are something that we look at diligently, day in and day out and the pipelines are pretty robust and that robustness gives us a pretty good sense of predictability in the future. So it's tough to say, because we don't question clients about, is this new account because you were shopping a better price or something. I do know that a lot of the growth that I mentioned in the areas that I mentioned have come from very good pipeline management, and very good value propositions around the world. ", "And I think that's going get better, the Sales 2.0 as I mentioned earlier is an initiative on our part to roll out a great value proposition across the middle market around the world. And it's something we're very, very excited about because nobody has ever really tried to do that before. So that's the best answer I can give you. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. ", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust", "Hi. I had two questions. One could you give us a comparable new business generation number for the first quarter? And then secondly, your early view even directionally on the Forex impact in 3Q, foreign exchange impact, top and bottom line. ", "Joe Plumeri", "The new business number in the first quarter was, I think, I'm trying to figure out what it was. It was low, it was lower than the 16%, it was in the low teens, maybe 12 or 13%. ", "Mark Hughes", "Okay.", "Joe Plumeri", "And what's your second question again I'm sorry. ", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust", "Any read on where you think the foreign exchange impact is going to be in the third quarter top and bottom line? ", "Stephen Wood", "", "Steven, look, assuming all things stay equal and rates stay relatively calm. It's always hard one to forecast because of all the variables that go in to it. We anticipate that will have slight uplift in foreign exchange for Q3. We expect it to go slightly negative in Q4 and then for the full year we expect an overall upside from foreign exchange. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Keith Alexander, JP Morgan. ", "Keith Alexander - JPMorgan", "I was wondering if you could talk about your comfort with the company's ability to sustain current growth rates given the benign to cautious economic outlook in the developed world. And then more specifically in the global segment, what did growth look like excluding the Harbor point transaction?", "Joe Plumeri", "Give me your first question first, I'm sorry, I didn't quite get it. ", "Keith Alexander - JPMorgan", "Sure. I was just saying given the benign economic outlook for the developed world, how comfortable are you with being able to sustain current growth rates?", "", "Joe Plumeri", "Pretty comfortable. Because of diversity in the areas that I mentioned, Asia, it's been very, very strong, South America, has been very, very strong, and we've had amazing resiliency, Keith in Spain and Italy, even though those economies, as you know are not good. ", "I feel pretty comfortable about that. I know Sarah Turvill is probably behind me saying that she's got to raise the bar. She is the one responsible for international. But I feel pretty good about it. I just looked at her and she shook her head. The second part of your question was, harbor point. Of the seven it was five. ", "Keith Alexander - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then touching back on growth in Europe, I mean has the debt crisis impacted business that you've seen at all or should we expect it to in future quarters? ", "Joe Plumeri", "It hasn't yet. I don't think the debt crisis is necessarily related to our business in Europe as much as just the economic conditions, if you will. Spain had a positive growth, but not as positive as it would have been a year ago. Italy had positive growth, very positive growth. Almost double digits, but not as positive as it would have been a year ago, which means that that's really resilient. It takes in place like Spain, I am very proud of our Spanish operations, Spain and Portugal, Liberia in general where you've got 20%, I think unemployment and are growing at a strong mid single-digits. It's just terrific stuff. So, no, I don't think that the credit crisis in Greece has necessarily been the most impactful. I just think it's just the economies in general. ", "Keith Alexander - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then, finally a numbers question. Can you breakdown the amortization of cash retention payments by segment? ", "Stephen Wood", "We don't provide that, I'm sorry. ", "Operator", "", "Next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus", "", "I guess you had mentioned earlier that the global segment margin was actually negatively impacted by foreign exchange and I would have thought because of the prevalence of pounds denominated expenses that would go the other way. Can you sort of go through the mechanics of that? ", "Grahame Millwater ", "The global segment was negatively impacted by its business in the London markets which is partially euros and sterling and obviously the dollar strengthened against the euro and therefore that's why you've got some of the negativity coming through. ", "Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus", "With a stronger dollar, if the expenses are disproportionately pound would that expand margins?", "Joe Plumeri ", "Yes, the expenses aren't on specific to just global; the expenses go across other parts of the business as well. ", "Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. That's fair enough. Joe you talked a lot about investments this time and I guess, if we look back to 2005, 2006. There was a lot of the investments in pounds and it doesn't seem like it was a complete success. Can you talk about how things are different this time? ", "Joe Plumeri ", "No. It's not a success, thanks for reminding me of the failure. We recruited a lot of people back then. This is a different kind of investment. I name some of the investment and I put under the category the retention award, it is an investment in our own people. That's certainly different than going out and recruiting a lot of people. ", "I've admitted in 2005 that we recruited a lot of people, that wasn't successful. So this is a different kind of investment. The capital markets is a different kind of investment.", "You are actually seeing accretion in those investments. You retain your people's accretive. The capital markets was a big investment. That was accretive. We made a great investment and reinsurance in the cargos group, a year or so ago that was accretive right off the back.", "It's those kinds of targeted investments that I'm making reference to. Teams of people internationally that continue to do well. We've made investments in Brazil for example, like that and in South America that have been accretive.", "So when I say investment, I do not mean go recruit a lot of people. I don't think hiring a whole bunch of people and maybe getting one or two good ones out of a bunch is what we're doing. These are targeted sane, sober investments and the reason I brought it up so much, that you mentioned that early in your question, is because I know if I were you, I'd say that's wonderful organic growth. And with the expenses, the way Willis manages expenses, you should have had really great margin expansion.", "And I'm trying to explain to you, that's what I would have said and I have tried to explain why that is not the case. It's not because I'm emphasizing the investment more than I usually do, I am simply emphasizing it because when you have that kind of spread, you should have gotten better margin expansion and I think we are doing the right thing. ", "Operator", "Our next question is Adam Klauber of Macquarie Securities. Your line is open. ", "Adam Klauber - Macquarie Securities ", "Could you talk about the capital markets business, what other potential transactions could that unit do and how did the pipeline look right now? ", "Joe Plumeri", "Well, we could do almost anything as long as we are not using our own money. We are not an investment bank. So, we don't have an investment committee,\u00a0but anything that we can do on advisory basis, anything we can do to help like we do with Stonepoint and (inaudible) a arrange advice the transaction which was significant. You got to remember, that Tony or Sana who runs that group and his people are seasoned insurance bankers. They know the space very well. We didn't hire a bunch of people who never have done this before. ", "And I think it augments our reinsurance business really well. So when you sit back and you say Joe what do you do for insurance companies? We have a great reinsurance operation with great analytics, with great tools so that including the Willis research network and then on top of that you have an in-house, an investment bank that advises insurance companies. ", "So when you look at that across the board, you say that's pretty good arsenal of activity where we help our insurance clients and they work together very nicely. If you think that the soft market's going to stay soft, and consolidations and are going to continue, then we are at great position to continue doing these kinds of things, and I can only tell you that the pipeline is big. A lot of people on the acquisition trail. You know this. And there are a lot of people that at one point in time market continues to be soft, so we'll throw up their hands and I give. And so I like the position we're in. ", "I love what we do for insurance companies from reinsurance all the way to capital markets and now we've got a great capability in the cat bond area, with people who find lots of cat bonds in the past. So that's the way we look at it. We look at it as capital and what kind of capital requirements do insurance companies need and with Tony Ursano and Peter Hearn and the whole team, its fun to watch these guys. ", "Adam Klauber - Macquarie Securities ", "Thanks. Question on deferred comp, can you give us an idea for an annual basis, what the deferred comp should run and what the amortization should be? ", "Stephen Wood", "The amortization on the retention is about $32 million at quarter. ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the Brian Meredith with UBS. ", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "I am wondering is it possible to get the North American organic revenue growth ex-the employee benefits business? ", "Joe Plumeri", " No. Not off the top, but we don't calculate that way. I'm look at Don Bailey; I don't think he does either, no. ", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "I guess on the employee benefit\u2026", "Joe Plumeri", "The reason for that is not a dodge; it's that the business is so intertwined in the branches, that it's tough to separate it. ", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Right. And what do you think is driving the growth in the employee benefits business, obviously with unemployment still high here. ", "Joe Plumeri", "I think they really got a great business proposition, but I'm going let Don answer that question. The people are really good, I'm proud of them. There is great value proposition. Don, you want to get to that please?", "Don Bailey", "Sure. Yes, I think it certainly Brian, some of which he was just talking about a unique value proposition and positioning in the marketplace. We sit I think very affectively in that space. We are smaller than some of the very large consultants that do a lot of fee for service type of work and we are much larger than all of the smaller agencies that are out there, that are mostly purely transactional. ", "So we occupied space that tends to be middle market client driven and downstream from there where we make most of our money on commissions and provide a lot of value added services, HR communication, wellness programs that come along with the commission. So it's a unique positioning that we have in the marketplace. ", "I would also give a lot of credit to the leadership of our employee benefits business in North America for really transforming that value proposition and bringing a lot of the sales management that Joe talked about earlier, pipelines, forecasting, in a much bigger magnitude to the business than we ever had before. ", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "And then one other quick one, Don I need to talk a little bit about the pricing environment in the quarter, was it incrementally worse, incrementally kind of little less worse, what was happening with rates this quarter? And the insurance companies are kind of giving us two different views. ", "Joe Plumeri", "I will go first and then Don can pile on at (inaudible). I said that the rate environment was down 4% in the second quarter. That's worse than the first quarter which was 3%. So we see it getting worse. We don't see it getting better. There is no stabilization that we see in sight. And as I said that the exposure in units, if you will, and this is insurance companies telling me this are up in the 9%-10% range. So I don't know what they are telling you, but that's what we see. Don you got\u2026", "Don Bailey", "The only thing I would add to that Joe is that it's more specific in some areas Brian, to Joe's point of this kind of double dip. You have even in some FI, DNO, ENO areas where we started to see firming not so long ago as those rates started to run up a little bit, you saw a lot of capacity start to chase that down and that's become much more competitive than it was even just a few months ago. So chime in with everything that Joe said it's becoming even more intensely competitive now than it was a few months ago. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "I wanted to follow up on a separate issue Joe, with regard to producer compensation. Can you talk about to the extent that you are having success and increasing upfront commissions and fees and broaden that out to anything else you want to talk about in terms of producer compensation? ", "Joe Plumeri", "Sure, I will. You know how we feel about on contingents and I only read with that, so that everybody understands again that, we've taken that position, we believe in it. And I think it's just for insight in case you are interested, I think its puts us a good stead with clients and prospects, you hear more and more from clients and prospects that they're proud of our position. And as you could see by our numbers in North America, excuse me especially, versus our competitors who have reported before us, who take them, that our number are better. ", "So we haven't given an inch. We still expect to get paid. We have told the underwriters, carriers that we expect to get paid. Don't misunderstand, the non-acceptance of contingence, we don't want to get paid. That gets back to what Grahame was talking about shaping our future. ", "One of the components of shaping our future is making sure that our commission up rights upgrades up front you know, for the business that we do. Based upon nothing more than negotiated up front commission between ourselves and the insurance carrier, and we are very happy with the progress there. And I said to the carriers that I don't expect to get paid any less just because we don't accept contingence. So I think that's going along well. You can see further the components are shaping our future is that and that's going very, very well. Don, you got anything else you want to add to that?", "Don Bailey", "Want to add specifically on producer recruiting is a key metric for us in terms of running our business obviously is keeping the producers and bringing on new producers. Two key parts to that, one is obviously having a value proposition for them to sell. And the other part is a viable producer compensation plan. ", "We have a plan in place that we think is best-in-class in our market. It emphasizes retention, but also emphasizes growth, but specific to the issue of contingence, when you don't take contingence and you take all of your comp in upfront commissions, producers get paid on all of that revenue. And that for us in the recruiting game is differentiator that we don't have the organization taking centrally contingence out of the comp pool. We are actually leaving that all in and producers get paid on it and that becomes a competitive advantage for us from a recruiting perspective. Okay, Jay?", "Operator", "Next question comes from the Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus. ", "Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus", "So I just wanted to ask you a broad question. When you see the underwriting results that the industry is reporting, in the aggregate and you contrast that with the rate declines, we've seen for the past five or six years, did the numbers seem appropriate?", "Joe Plumeri", "No. No. It doesn't. When you got insurance stock, I mean this is my own personal opinion, when you have insurance stocks selling at discounts to book, plus you got investment income down, and you got rates as low as they are, it seems to be in (inaudible). But I don't run an insurance company, but it would seem to be in (inaudible). ", "Lot of cash, lot of them are buying stock back, obviously, couple in particular. And so there is a lot of cash out there and a lot of capacity, so you would think that because of that capacity that's the reason the rates are low and it's going to take quite an event to change all of that. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cliff Gallant with KBW. ", "Cliff Gallant - KBW", "It is a na\u00efve question, because if rates are falling, I assume low price is still winning out there, but are you seeing any change in terms of preference by buyers of insurance, is there concern over the credit quality of their insurers? ", "Joe Plumeri ", "It's not apparent. It's not apparent, no. I'm looking around the room to my colleagues, and they're all shaking their head, no it is not apparent at all Cliff. ", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. ", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust ", "Yes thank you. The sharp turnaround in the UK how much of that was a ramp up in the new business and then is that paid sustainable?", "Joe Plumeri", "The ramp up in the new business in the UK was very good. As a matter of fact this morning, David Margrett and I and Grahame had a review at the UK. And yeah, I think it's sustainable and I think they are doing a great job with their pipelines. We examined pipelines in this place like its second breadth. UK as you know, UK and Ireland, UK was positive for the first time in a long time and Ireland still negative, but not as negative as it used to be. That country, as you know, was staggered with the economic crisis over the last couple of years and is really getting down now to where it's negative growth is close to breakeven so or zero. So we are very happy about that and we think it's going in a positive direction. David, you want to say anything?", "David Margrett", "No, I agree. Across every segment, we carry on seeing strong new business growth and expect that to continue with the work we put into our progress. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Keith Walsh with Citi. ", "Keith Walsh - Citi", "Hi everyone just a follow-up on the amortization of cash retention payments. So if you had $32 million this quarter and you write in the press release $26 in Q2 '09, so that the $6 million dollar variance, is that a good run rate I think in about the second half of the year that it would be a $6 million pressure on your margin for the next couple of quarters as well. ", "Joe Plumeri ", "Yes, that's pretty accurate Keith. ", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no further questions. ", "Joe Plumeri", "Okay. Thank you everybody. Have a nice day.

My name is Danyel and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode and we will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]", "As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to Ms. Mary Malone, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Mary Malone - Director of Investor Relations", "Good morning. This is Mary Malone, Director of Investor Relations at Watson Wyatt Worldwide. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. I am here today with John Haley, Watson Wyatt's President and Chief Executive Officer and Carl Mautz, Chief Financial Officer.", "After some brief prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions. Please refer to our website for this morning's press release. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay via telephone for the next week by dialing 617-801-6888, confirmation number, 85045287.

Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Mary. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. I am very pleased to share the results of another strong quarter with you. Our revenues for the quarter increased to $458 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year. On an organic basis that excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency movements, our revenues increased 6% over the prior year.", "On a constant currency basis our segment revenue growth was very strong in four of our segments, 20% in Benefits, 14% in Technology and Administration Solutions, 18% in Human Capital Group and 25% in Investment Consulting. Insurance & Financial Services continues to perform below our expectations with 1% constant currency growth.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.96. This is a 26% increase over the prior period of $0.76 per share.", "Margin, net income and earnings per share increases are all driven by the strong revenue growth. Our forecasted rate of $1.95 for the British pound was slightly less than the actual exchange rate of $1.99 for the quarter and therefore $0.01 of our EPS increase over guidance is due to exchange rate differences. We continue to see solid demand in the marketplace and we are optimistic about the growth opportunities for our business.", "As you can see from our results, our business is performing well in the current economic environment. We continue to see that our diverse portfolio of services combined with our global presence is providing a solid business platform even in a slowing economy.", "Now, let's review each of our segments beginning with Benefits. For the quarter, Benefits Group revenues were $268 million, up 21% from the prior year and 20% on a constant currency basis. Strong demand for our services in all geographic regions resulted in solid growth. Europe's growth also benefited from our acquisitions in Germany and The Netherlands. Excluding acquisitions and currency movements, organic growth was 6%. This growth is even after the spin-off of our multi-employer retirement business in North America.", "As we mentioned in last quarter's call, we think this segment is impacted more by changes in the legislative and regulatory framework than by changes in the macro economic environment. We continue to assist our clients with implementation of provisions from the Pension Protection Act. Congress continues to work on technical corrections and clarifications to the act. The timing and full scope of this next piece of legislation are not clear. However, we think our clients will continue to face changes resulting from the Pension Protection Act through their 2008, 2009 plan years.", "Pension accounting continues to be an area of focus for both the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the U.S. and the International Accounting Standards Board. The accounting for pensions and other post-employment benefits is complicated and require significant use of judgment and estimation. The changes will probably be significant and affect the measurement of liabilities, the timing of expense recognition and the presentation of financial statements. Although the discussions have started, we expect it will be several years before the changes are enacted.", "We recently published the results of a retirement plan design survey that covered 300 U.S. employers, each improvements sponsored a defined benefit plan since 1996 and have at least $100 million of pension assets. While there has been a shift over the past ten years from the traditional defined benefit pension plans to define contribution in hybrid define plans, our survey shows that the majority of plans sponsors that maintained defined benefit plans today have made a formal decision to stay committed to them. The fact is defined benefit plans remain the most efficient way of delivering retirement wealth to employees and for helping companies manage their aging workforce.", "When companies don't provide their employees with plans that amass sufficient savings for retirement, they struggle with the problem of hidden pensioners, employees to stay on the payroll because they can't afford to retire. One of the biggest changes for the future could be the resurgence of hybrid defined benefit plans, which offer features of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.", "Companies are becoming more aware of the trade-offs between cost, risk and workforce management and we anticipate this strong demand will exist around the globe for our retirement services.", "Our healthcare consulting practice had another strong quarter. While this is still small part of our overall benefits practice, it is experiencing solid growth and we expect revenues of approximately $75 million in fiscal 2008. With healthcare cost still rising at twice the rate of inflation, healthcare reform continues to be a hot topic. All three major party presidential candidates have issued proposals for health care reforms. While the proposals reflect the fundamental philosophical and political differences between the candidates, all three candidates claim their proposal will result in higher quality healthcare, greater transparency about treatments, cost and outcomes and improved use of information technology. The ultimate outcome for healthcare reform will be decided until after the election.", "Our research shows that most U.S. companies do not support a single payer healthcare system or State Legislature mandating coverage. Instead they prefer relying on private sector solutions. Despite their frustration with rising costs, U.S. employers believe they can do better job managing costs in meeting the needs of the workers than the government can. While companies continue to monitor legislative activity, the reform proposals are having little but no influence on company's decision to make healthcare program changes. The issues facing our clients are real and they continue to demand our consulting expertise and exploring alternatives.", "Now let's move on to the Technology and Administration Solutions Group. For the quarter revenues were $45 million, up 14% from prior year and 14% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues in North America continue to increase as the number of pension administration and health and welfare outsourcing assignments in ongoing service delivery increase. We had 121 projects in service delivery at the end of March 2008, up from 76 at the end of March 2007. You will recall that we don't recognize revenues until projects move into ongoing service delivery, which is after project implementation.", "At the end of March 2008, we had another 56 projects in implementation. From our perspective, the number of projects available for bid has not been impacted by the economic downturn. As our brand continues to strengthen in this practice, more opportunities are available to us. We have participated in more requests for proposals this year that have a lower win percentage. We continually refine our service offerings and remain focused on profitable growth.", "You will recall that we had strong sales last year. Our researchers continue to be very busy in part by certain clients' with systems already in service delivery. Our clients in ongoing service delivery comprise approximately 85% of our reported revenues in North America. We continue to be pleased with our renewal rate that is in excess of 90%.", "In Europe, our retention rate is excellent, among the best in the marketplace. We've also had tremendous success with many new clients. We won both first-generation outsourcing clients as well as clients who previously worked with our competition. We are increasing our market share and growing nicely. We continue to believe that we have compelling technology and outsourcing offerings that suite the markets we serve. We expect good profitable growth opportunities will be available regardless of the economic environment.", "Next, let me turn to the Human Capital Group. For the quarter, revenues were $49 million, up 19% from prior year and 18% on a constant currency basis. We experienced growth in both human capital consulting projects and data services. Increased demand for executive compensation and sales force compensation as well as merger integration projects all contributed to our growth. This growth exceeded our own expectations and we continue to be optimistic about demand in the current economic environment.", "There continues to be strong demand for compensation consulting, especially executive compensation. Our multi-year studies at 1000 large U.S. companies find a consistently strong positive relationship between realizable pay and performance.", "The alignment created by today's executive pay model significantly improves corporate performance and plays an integral role in generating the most productive economy in the world. However, there are certain elements of executive payment that have come under attack. These elements include some severance and golden parachute payments and large executive pensions. We assist companies with correcting any elements of the executive pay model than are not working optimally. As the election season heats up, we expect executive pay will come under increasing scrutiny.", "Properly designed pay for performance programs motivate managers to excel and drive the economic growth. With the continued scrutiny of executive pay, we think many companies will seek assistance with designing the fundamental incentives of their executive pay programs.", "Now I'll discuss the Insurance and Financial Services Group. For the quarter, revenues were $31 million, up 2% from the prior year and 1% on a constant currency basis. We have fewer larger projects in Europe this fiscal year than in past years and therefore our growth has been lower than expected. In Asia, this practice is performing well and experiencing strong growth. Our revenue ramp up in the U.S. continues to be slower than the initially anticipated. As we look ahead, we expect fiscal year 2009 to be a year of recovery. The practice leadership team is working on a thoughtful disciplined business plan for modestly growing revenues and for bringing the cost base in line with the planned revenues. We will give more detailed guidance for fiscal 2009 on our next call in August.", "Lastly, Investment Consulting had another great quarter. For the quarter, revenues were $43 million, up 27% from the prior year and 25% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see strong demand for all of our services, particularly advice on investment strategy. The sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States and a weakened U.S. dollar have caused market turmoil worldwide. With continued volatility predicted for the near future, investors, including pension funds, face a perplexing landscape. Plans sponsors that have taken steps to optimize the returns or reduce risk through their investment strategies whether by hedging diversification or better deals on fees are better positioned and those are still thinking about it. The current market will be challenging for many investors and we expect strong demand for our Investment Consulting services to continue.", "Wrapping up, we are optimistic about our long-term prospects and we'll keep an eye on short-term market conditions. We believe we are stronger than any time in the past given our market focus, operating discipline and global footprint.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Carl.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "Thank you, John and good morning to everyone. As you've just heard, we completed another exceptionally strong quarter led by robust revenue growth and strong margins. Our revenues for the quarter were $458 million and our operating margin increased to 14%, an all-time high for us. We continue to focus on profitable growth.", "The Benefits Group had a 33% margin this quarter, an increase from 30% in the third quarter of last year.

Our guidance by segment can be found on slide 3. Our Benefits revenue guidance is increasing to 18% to 20% growth for the fiscal year. This guidance includes an organic growth rate of approximately 5% to 6%.

The exit of the multi-employer retirement business will have more of an impact on fourth quarter than initially anticipated.", "The seasonality within our Benefits Group changed this year due to the Heissmann acquisition. Heissmann's strongest quarters are our second and third fiscal quarters during which Heissmann earns approximately 60% of its annual revenues.

We are not seeing any negative impact on the business from economic environment and we continue to be optimistic about the future.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Carl. Now we will take any questions that you may have.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please proceed.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets", "Hi, John and Carl.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "Hello.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello, Ashwin.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets", "Nice quarter again. I like how we can count on you guys to --.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets", "Can you... the question is on Benefits, can you get into, it was a solid quarter, but some of the details on how non-U.S. demand is sort of shaping up? I mean pension change in the UK is slightly older than in the U.S., is that still a good driver? Also in the Netherlands and Germany, how are the acquisitions that you made performing?", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "The acquisitions are performing very well with strong revenue growth. I'd remind you about the comment on seasonality for Heissmann where the December and March quarters are the strongest. Another thing that drove a little bit of the growth in Europe and in the branches' results this quarter, you will recall that we had a little bit slower quarter last... in the December quarter because of the vacation impact in the UK at the end of December. And that pumped up January a little bit. So as to the legislation, I think we anticipate that that will continue to drive demand in the UK and in the U.S., not so much impact at least in the warehouse in the Netherlands or in Germany. But those... the demand there has been strong and the growth has been very nice, actually a little bit better than we anticipated when we did the acquisition.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "What I would add to that, too, Ashwin is that we don't expect that the coming accounting changes that I referenced in my prepared remarks are something that will be of interest to define benefit plans around the world. It's not just FASB in the U.S. but it is also the International Accounting Standards Board, which is looking at these things.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets", "Right. The International Accounting Standards impact that fast I guess earlier in Europe than it is here, right?", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "Generally it does, yes.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets", "Okay. And then a question on the Insurance segment, what will it take to improve performance, what kind of steps are you taking? Is it layoffs or rightsizing or you just need more sales people?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right now, what we are doing, we don't by they way, I should just mention one thing, we don't have any evidence that the lower than expected growth is due to any kind of an economic slowdown on anything like that. We've been focused on expanding the practiced practice geographically both in Asia-Pacific and in the United States and developing our financial modeling software products, [inaudible]. If we look back on it, in hindsight we think we probably needed to focus more on business development in our established markets, particularly in the UK where we have already have very strong markets. This is largely a project-based practice and we did continually on the pipeline there. So, we're going to be focused on getting our revenues up or going to look to make sure that we have our cost base in line with that, but we are... we'd like to grow this practice to profitability.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets", "And once you do that, say for example, for 2009, maybe not for full-year but as you get into it, can you get back to the high-teens margins that you had in that unit once?", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "We're targeting for next year, probably in the mid-teens, a 15% range on the way back to stronger improvement in the future. I think we are just going to be cautious without having an overly aggressive plan so that we can grow this... gradually maintaining our profitability as we go.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets", "Okay.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "That's really the tenure of what the team is telling us.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "But I think this is not something we expect to see turned around in another quarter.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets", "No, that's understood but over a course of a few quarters if you can get to mid-teens that will be fabulous.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, Carl maybe a little more optimistic than I am on that as to how fast we will get there, but I think we have to look at all elements of this. We got to look at the cost base, we have to look at how we grow our revenues additionally.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets", "Okay, great. Nice quarter. Thanks.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Andrew Fones with UBS. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. This is actually Jim Watson [ph], I am filling in for Andrew this morning. I had a question about the Tech... you said the number of projects available hasn't been impacted by the slowdown. Is that true, I guess, across the board from in your perspective or are you seeing any targets of weakness with in the industries?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are not seeing a slowdown in the number of RFPs that we are having the opportunity to respond to. We have, as I noted, our associates are quite busy. We're focused on profitable revenue growth. Some of these proposals get to the point where we don't see the profitability we want, we back off of them. But we're not seeing an economic impact with would cause us to believe that technology spend increase, for example, is slowing down.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And you mentioned that the win rate might have kept [inaudible]?", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "The comment just I made earlier that fundamentally we're aimed at profitable projects to get to the point where the pricing is more aggressive than we think is in line with what we want to do, we back off of it. Our associates are busy, we're providing with strong revenue support on existing plans, those plans and projects are going well. So, we are just going to look for just wherever we can make the kind of money we think we should.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. That makes sense.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me try and put this in a little bit of perspective, too. We, as you know, we don't recognize the revenues during the systems implementation. So, decline in the wins doesn't immediately impact our revenues. In North America, 85% of our revenues there come from ongoing services that we provide to clients. So as the number of systems in service delivery grows then the systems implementations become an even smaller and smaller part of the overall North American practice. If we got a long period where we got some field wins, we could see a potential for decline. But, we see this is probably being more than offset by providing additional services to existing clients in North America and by the growth we had in Europe. So we'll give you exact guidance for fiscal 2009 on our call on August. But, we feel pretty good about the overall structure.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, and I guess in terms of how many months of work is there the pipeline, do you have... what's your estimate there?", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "We certainly have enough work in the pipeline to maintain our growth rates through fiscal 2009. The sell season goes on. year around we'll report on that as we go but as John suggested, we are quite optimistic about that at this point.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And one last one. Can you tell me how much revenue and expense was capitalized for Tech and for the other businesses in Q1?", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "I should be able to tell you that. You will find it in the... you said Q1, do you mean Q3?", "Unidentified Analyst", "I am sorry, Q3.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "You'll find that in...", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It is in the 10-Q.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "It is in the 10-Q itself. You'll find that under --", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "Cost capitalized... and that's in the model. We have to go to the right page, you know. Just give me a second. In the third quarter, it was just about $5 million. It runs between $5.5 million and $4.5 million.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, okay. Thanks very much.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of T.C. Robillard with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "Good morning, guys.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "Good morning.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "Just, I'm going to stay true to my form here and I am going to push you John on your conservativeness. The margins look like they're going to take a little bit more of a dip in the fourth quarter sequentially, just backing into your top line and bottom line guidance. Clearly, you guys have a fantastic track record of delivering above your number and we know that there're some conservative side to that. I just want to make sure that there is nothing unique going on in the fourth quarter in terms of some costs or some ramp ups or anything that we should be taking into account?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Well, since Carl is the who is the expert on conservatism, I can handle this. Well, I think the broad answer is there is nothing special going on in the fourth quarter really but you can talk to, if you would.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "Let me hit that summary part and then come back and talk a little bit about detail. We were actually concerned of putting our forecast together that there might be someone concluding that we were seeing some economic impact or something else unusual going on in that business. The fist quarter has been driven simply by our normal seasonality and let me just go back to a couple of those. This is a business that has a cost structure and the near term it's pretty constant. When revenues are very strong as they were in the third quarter, you get a tremendous lift to margins and we have been slow just a little bit as we expect they will in the fourth quarter from our normal seasonality, you see the margins reflect that. Going back again the retirement business, the benefits business, we're seeing coming off of a very strong third quarter, which is very strong in Germany. The benefits business seasonality now is that the first quarter is not as strong as that part of business. So that will drive some margin change. We're a little concerned about Financial Insurances and Financial Services that will be part of it. And don't forget that the [inaudible] multi-employer business is hitting the margins in the fourth quarter, a little more strongly frankly than we thought about in the... when we thought in the third quarter, it's a little bit more concentrated. So those are certainly the drivers that I noted as I was summarizing the forecast coming from the practice directly. And we will see...", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "But, I think in overall, in terms of putting this together when we were looking at our fourth quarter estimates, we have Benefits and Investment Consulting about where they were, about where they will be for the whole year. We have HAS [ph] and HCG about where they were in the first quarter, which is a little bit lower than second and third quarter. And then insurance is down but these are not... there are not... they are reasonably related to what we have seen during the year.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "Okay. And then as we look going forward, I mean it sounds as if the strength of the business, everything you guys are seeing in the visibility of your pipeline and as you're looking at your cost structure, your product mix, things like that, it appears that we should be able to see consistent margin improvement on a year-on-year basis as we go through next year as well, I mean, just kind of the normal business efficiencies. Is that a fair way to think about things?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think that is a fair way to think about it. We think that quarters can be reasonably volatile and we need to be careful about looking at them. But we have been talking about having slight improvements in your margins year-over-year and we think we can continue to do that for few more years anyway.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "Okay. And just I wanted to circle back to the insurance practice and actually from my standpoint, you actually had a little bit better quarter than I was expecting as for as margins went. Is this something even though you guys still have a lot of moving parts there and there's still a lot of runway left before we see the lift in margin. Is that something we can expect that to at least remains profitable? I know you guys had an impact last quarter but is that something where 5% going up over the next year or so is a good way to think about it?", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "I would look beyond Q4 of this year and anticipate that we'll start to see some turnaround. I think the team is going to be cautious about that and we will try and give you some exclusive guidance as we come into the August call.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We don't think it's... I guess to give you a little more, we don't think the revenue is going to be going down and we don't think it's going to be negative in terms of margins.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "For forth quarter?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I was speaking for next year.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "So should we be thinking about possibly negative margin in the fourth quarter for the practice?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I wouldn't say negative margin. You could see some modest revenue reduction in quarter-over-quarter however in the fourth quarter.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "Okay. And then just as far as anything unique in terms of your other expense when you give your segment breakdown and you're breaking down part of the non-segments items? There was... I mean it looks similar as to what it was in the fiscal third quarter last year. Just can you remind me why you have... tend to have a big expense in... other expense in the third quarter?", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "The other expense in the quarter, which is still within... you're looking at the capital within operating...?", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "Yes, I'm looking at when you gave... when you give the breakdown of segments, I think it was like negative $10.8 million.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "Those are largely the expense side of our pass-throughs such as situations we are operating as a subcontractor if you will for our clients particularly doing printing or fulfillment note purchasing and that's normal seasonality.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "Okay. Just wanted to make sure there was nothing unique there.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "And then just lastly, just to tie in on, you were very clear in your prepared remarks and even during the Q&A about not seeing any of the economic slowdown. I mean I think that speaks for itself in the Human Capital fees. Can you remind us what the most cyclical piece within Human Capital is? Is it the... it's not the data piece, is it the fee, the capital or the consulting, excuse me?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We have three broad pieces. We have compensation, we have the organizational effectiveness and we have the data services and the organization effectiveness is probably the most sensitive.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "And I am assuming that you guys, there is nothing to call out there that that still continues to do well.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think in the last quarter's call, one of the points we made was that we were probably better positioned in this practice overall than at any time in the past in terms of potential downturns and the kind of... the kind of work we have now is more repeat business. It's more reliable and still think that. And as we look in third quarter here, we really haven't seen any evidences of the slowdown.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "And it's different because you have a higher executive comp exposure and things like that or --?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, and the executive comp work we do is more... it's more a business that is done every year.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America Securities", "Gotcha. Okay, great. Thanks for the comments, guys.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please proceed.", "Jeff Meuler - Robert W. Baird", "Hi, it's Jeff Mueller from Baird. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how much work your clients still need to do related to the PPA for plane year 2008 and then how much you would expect it to step down in 2009, barring that technical corrections which I think are still in converse to get passed? And then finally just how significant those technical corrections would be?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's really hard to estimate. In fact we actually don't... I mean, this is one of the things we dealt within the other quarterly calls. So, we don't keep track of our work for clients as to whether it happens to be PPA work or not. So, we couldn't even tell you even looking back over the last few quarters how much of it was PPA work, let alone, what they will be doing in the next quarter. So, I would say this, I think there was probably right after PPA came up, a little bit of revenue bump from having done some extra work for that, but most of the PPA work is sort of in maintenance mode now and we are continuing it. We do think that we'll get some revenue bump when they get technical corrections out. But, again, we really couldn't forecast that at all.", "Jeff Meuler - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, thank you. And then on the acquisition front, I was just wondering what are the geographies are you targeting and then on the healthcare side would you consider an acquisition or are you looking to hire more aggressively there given that there looks to be some catalyst coming out?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Meuler, see first on the acquisitions, I think we are interested in continuing to look for high quality acquisitions and if we can find them we are certainly in the market for them. And we are always looking, we are looking now. There is nothing that we are targeting. Back about two or three years ago, we felt that we needed to have more significant operations in both Germany and The Netherlands. That was something that was a missing part of the global network. We don't feel that way about any particular geography right now. There're some we are looking at and we might get into but there is nothing where we feel a burning need to get into it. So, we'll be looking for the right opportunities there. In Healthcare, I think if we could... we'd be open to finding the right kind of acquisition to do that. I'm not sure that there're a lot out there that certainly would be good for us. At least it would be of any size to do that but it's the kind of thing we're certainly open to.", "Jeff Meuler - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And then not to jump the gun on you Carl. But John, is there any update on the CFO search, where are you on that progress?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we've hired an outside search firm. We have a committee composed of five people; myself and Carl, Babloo Ramamurthy, our Head of our European Operations, Gene Wickes is the Head of our Benefits Operations and then Steve Mele, our Head of Human Resources and the five of us are interviewing... are going to be interviewing all the candidates and then making a decision about whom we want to hire. At this point, we're interviewing candidates this month and we'll see how that goes. It's obviously more important to get the right person than to try to act too quickly.", "Jeff Meuler - Robert W. Baird", "Understood. Thanks for all the time and congratulations on another great quarter.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question is from the line of Brandt Sakakeeny Deutsche Banc. Please proceed.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc", "Thank you. Hi, John and Carl.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Brand. How are you doing?", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc", "I'm doing great. Thanks. Let's see... first off, I had a bad connection, so I hope this hasn't been asked earlier. But did you give out any attrition metrics so far in terms of turnover or anything else?", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "We haven't.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we didn't and I'm not sure we have anything right off hand on that.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc", "I guess, broadly, can you just talk to sort of cost of hiring and how is the labor market do you feel like. You have enough of a talent pool to hit the headcount targets and are you seeing any change in attrition levels one way or the other?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I don't think, we're noticing any big changes in attrition levels one way or the other. And then I guess if you... if there really were to be a slowdown hypothetically that might make your attrition levels go down somewhat. But, we haven't seen any... I don't think we've seen much change. We're continuing to be out in the marketplace looking to hire people. We want to be careful about bringing people on, we want to make sure we have enough work for them. But we're not seeing anything one way or the other, Brand.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc", "Okay, great. And then just an update on balance sheet, may be excess cash needs, I know I always ask this but just wondering if there is a change?", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I mean, what's our... our projection is we're going to end the year with about, what $70 million in cash, Cal?", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "Yes, in cash and the debt repaid. The share repurchase... the $100 million share repurchase is probably going to now stretch into a little bit to the first half fiscal '09.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc", "Okay.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "But we'll pay down the debt and continue that effort.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc", "Carl, how much do you have remaining on your authorization on the share repurchase authorization?", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "At March, we had about $75 million, $78 million.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "$77.4.", "Carl D. Mautz - Chief Financial Officer, Vice President", "Thank you. John, always has the right [inaudible]. We've done a little bit of repurchasing since then, so it's down a little from then.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc", "Okay. Great. Perfect. That's all I have. Great job in the quarter.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well Brandt that $77.4 million was what we had left at the end of April. So we had used $22.6 million.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc", "Okay. Thanks, John.", "Operator", "At this time there are no more question in the queue. I would now like to turn the presentation back over to Mr. John Haley for any closing remarks.", "John J. Haley - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Well.

Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Mary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to share the results of another strong quarter capping an impressive fiscal year. Our revenues for the fiscal year increased to $1.76 billion, an 18% increase over prior year. On an organic basis excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency movements, our revenues increased 8% over prior year. For the year we achieved $3.50 in diluted earnings per share, a 34% increase over the prior year. Our revenues for the quarter increased to $454 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year. On an organic basis our revenues increased 10% over prior year fourth quarter.", "Our segment revenue growth on a constant currency basis was very strong in four of our segments during the quarter, 15% in benefits, 21% in Technology and Administration Solutions, 13% in Human Capital Group and 25% in Investment Consulting. Insurance and Financial Services declined 5% on a constant currency basis. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.95. This is a 34% increase over the prior period and $0.71 per share. Our EPS growth resulted from strong revenue growth, the increase in our affiliate income and the decreases in our shares outstanding and income tax rate. Our business performed very well, especially in light of economic conditions. We're cautiously optimistic about revenue growth in fiscal 2009 and Carl will give full guidance for the next fiscal year in his remarks. In terms of demand, companies still need our services and we will continue to benefit from increasing complexity generally whether around regulatory reform or sophisticated investment possibilities.", "From a strategic standpoint, we're going to stay focused on what we do best, even more so in light of economic conditions. First, we're focused on clients. We will continue to be on top of the issues and pressures they are facing and we're orchestrating our services to meet those needs. Internally, we continue to focus on financial and operational discipline. With our strong balance sheet, we want to use the economic uncertainty to strengthen our hand even more. For example, we're hiring aggressively in the investment practice and making strategic hires in other practices. We also think there is real opportunity to grow market share in our carefully defined target market especially among the world's largest multinationals. We continue to look for strategic acquisitions to fill geographic holes and strengthen our practices.", "Now, let's review each of our segments beginning with Benefits. For the year, Benefits Group revenues were $993 million, an increase of 21% over prior year and 18% on a constant currency basis. On an organic basis, excluding acquisitions and foreign currency movements, Benefits revenues increased 6%. For the quarter, Benefits Group revenues were $255 million, up 17% from prior year and 15% on a constant currency basis. We experienced increased demand for our services in all geographic regions. Our growth in Europe was especially strong even after consideration of our German acquisition, earlier this year.", "Excluding acquisitions and currency movements, organic growth for the practice was 8%. This growth is even after the spin-off of our multi-employer retirement business in North America. We continue to assist companies around the world with the complex issues they face around the design and administration of their employee retirement benefits. As companies continue to evaluate the trade-offs between cost, risk and workforce management, we anticipate that there will continue to be global demand for our retirement services. Our healthcare consulting practice had another strong quarter. While this is still a small part of our overall benefits practiced, it is experiencing solid growth. With healthcare costs continuing to increase, employers are turning to a number of options to improve employee health into controlled healthcare costs.", "According to a survey that we conducted with the National Business Group on Health, healthcare cost increases for companies with high participation and consumer directed health plans are roughly half those of companies offering traditional health coverage. Consumer directed health plans are cost effective health and welfare programs that encourage workers to adopt healthier lifestyles and to become smarter healthcare consumers. With many companies focused on containing the cost of healthcare benefits, we expect the demand for our healthcare consulting services will continue to grow. Now let's move on to Technology and Administrative Solutions Group. For the year revenues were $183 million, a 16% increase over prior year and 14% on a constant currency basis. For the quarter, revenues were $48 million, up 21% from prior year and 21% on a constant currency basis. We have stronger than expected demand for services at existing clients in North America and therefore our revenues are better than forecasted. Our revenues in North America continue to increase as the number of pension administration and health and welfare outsourcing assignments in ongoing service delivery increased.", "We had 142 projects in service delivery at the end of June 2008, up from 84 at the end of June 2007. These projects are of varying size and are in addition to more than 100 systems that we had implemented prior to the change in accounting rules in 2004. You will recall that we don't recognize revenues until projects move into ongoing services delivery, which is after project implementation. At the end of June 2008 we had another 50 projects in implementation.", "Companies continue to take a selective approach to outsourcing their HR technology and functions. Selective outsourcing is growing so popular because it can be tailored to meet an organization's exact needs. For most organizations this means outsourcing routine transaction-oriented processes while refocusing the HR department on more strategic issues. Many companies report that selective outsourcing best meets their needs for access to leading edge technologies while leveraging their own capabilities and improving employee experience in service levels. The key to successful outsourcing is finding the solutions that fit the organization's needs and culture.", "The economic strain some companies are facing will only add to the reasons to choose selective outsourcing. As this practice matures in North America and we have more clients in ongoing service delivery, the clients with projects and implementation will become less significant to our total performance. We continue to see some price competition and we will only pursue profitable growth. Our number of projects and implementation has declined slightly from last quarter but we're experiencing steady growth. Our associates continue to be very busy in part by expanding the services provided to existing clients. We continue to be pleased with our retention rate.", "We're also performing well in Europe and have excellent retention there too. The outsourcing of benefits administration is a mature market in the UK. We are one of the major players and we continue to win new clients. We are excited about the client wins we had this fiscal year and our European team is very busy with the new client installs. We tend to have lower margins during the installation period and Carl will discuss this further when he provides the guidance for fiscal 2009. We have compelling technology and outsourcing offerings that suit the markets we serve. We expect good profitable growth opportunities will continue to be available.", "Next let me turn to the Human Capital Group. For the year revenues were $196 million, a 15% increase over prior year and 12% on a constant currency basis. For the quarter revenues were $51 million, up 16% from prior year and 13% on a constant currency basis. We experienced growth in both Human Capital consulting projects and data services. Demand was especially strong for both executive compensation and broadbased employee compensation programs. Inflation has been in the news not just in the U.S. but globally. Unlike currency there are no hedging strategies related to people costs. The impact of inflation on people cost is real and can be difficult to manage. In times of global inflation, many companies look to us for reputable market data and related consulting. We except demand for our services will continue.", "Now I'll discuss the Insurance and Financial Services Group. For the year revenues were $119 million, an increase of 4% over prior year, but flat on a constant currency basis. For the quarter, revenues were $29 million, a 2% decline from prior-year and a 5% decline on a constant currency basis. The decline in revenues is due to fewer large projects in Europe this fiscal year than in past years. The practice continues to perform well in Asia and we had modest revenue growth in North America. We will make some investment in our life insurance consulting practice in North America in FY09. We believe we've rightsized our organization for a profitable growth in Europe and Asia next fiscal year.", "Lastly, Investment Consulting ends the fiscal year with another great quarter. For the year revenues were $169 million, an increase of 31% over prior year or 27% on a constant currency basis. For the quarter, revenues were $43 million, up 26% from prior year and 25% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see strong demand for all of our services, particularly advice on investment strategy. In today's complex investment markets, pension funds continue to be challenged with how best to turn today's plan assets into tomorrow's retirement income. Funds continue to seek advice on how to ride out crises, how to make the most of long time horizons and how to provide good value for money.", "The current market continues to be challenging for many investors. We expect strong demand for our investment consulting services to continue although market conditions have impacted liquidity and pricing for those clients who wished to hedge liability risks and this may impact the pace at which projects can be executed. Wrapping up, we performed well despite the challenging economic times. We're cautiously optimistic that we will continue to grow in each of our practices next fiscal year.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Carl.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you John and good morning to everyone. As you've just heard, we had a strong finish to our fiscal 2008. For the year, we achieved revenues of $1.76 billion and diluted earnings per share of $3.50. For the quarter, we reported revenues of $454 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.95. Our results this quarter were helped by the $2.7 million of affiliate income, our continued share repurchases and a low income tax rate. Our operating margin was down slightly this quarter.", "The Benefits Group had a 29% margin for the year, an increase from 27% last year. For the quarter, the Benefits Group had a 30% margin, up from 29% in the fourth quarter of last year. These margins are consistent with our expectations of full year margins in the high 20% range.", "Technology and Administration Solutions had a 26% margin for the year, an increase from 23% last year. The increase over prior year is due primarily to the one-time work in North America. For the quarter, Technology and Administration Solutions had a 26 % margin, up from 24% in the fourth quarter of last year. These margins again are consistent with our expectations of the mid 20% range.", "Human Capital Group had an 18% margin for the year, an increase from 14% last year. For the year we achieved margin improvement in all geographic regions especially in North America. For the quarter, Human Capital Group had a 15% margin, up from 11% in the fourth quarter of last year. For the quarter we achieved notable margin improvement in North America and Asia Pacific. Insurance and Financial Services had a 2% margin for the year, a decrease from 17% last year. For the quarter, Insurance and Financial Services had a negative 1% margin, down from 14% in the fourth quarter of last year. Margins in the fourth quarter were depressed as we encouraged some non-recurring charges to rightsize the cost structure of the practice in both North America and Europe.", "Investment Consulting had a 35% margin for the year, an increase from 31% last year. For the quarter, Investment Consulting had a 35% margin, up from 32% in the fourth quarter of last year. This quarter's margin improvement was due to continued strong performance in Europe. The segment margins that we have just reviewed are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate cost such as amortization of intangibles resulting from our acquisition. Our full-year operating income margin was 12.9%, an increase from 12.1% last year. We achieved this margin improvement in spite of increased non-cash amortization from the acquisition.", "For the quarter, our operating income margin was 11.3%, a decline from 12.4% in the prior year quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline is due to an increase in reimbursable expenses, the seasonality of [inaudible] and the timing of similar occupancy and other expenses. Net income for the year was $155 million, an increase from $116 million last year. Net income for the quarter was $42 million, up from $32 million in the prior year. Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.95 compared to prior year fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.71.", "Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $124 million of cash and no debt. We also used $29 million to repurchase shares during the quarter pursuant to our $100 million share repurchase bringing us to total share repurchases of $45 million at the end of the quarter. We expect to complete our $100 million share repurchase by November 2008. Our business will continue to generate strong cash flows and this year we reported $284 million in cash flows from operations.", "Now, let's review our guidance for fiscal 2009. The slides posted on our website may be helpful for following along in this section. Please note that our forward-looking guidance assumes the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009 and this negatively impacts revenue growth and profit growth to some extent. We are assuming exchange rate of $1.99 to the British pound for the first half of fiscal year and the exchange of $1.95 to the British pound for the back half of the fiscal year.", "We have assumed an exchange rate of $1.55 to the euro in the first quarter that steadily drops to $1.47 to the euro by the fourth quarter with an average of about $1.51 to the euro for the fiscal year.", "For fiscal 2009, we're expecting revenues of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion, an increase of approximately 5% to 8% over fiscal 2008. Our revenue guidance by segment can be found on slide three. We are expecting diluted earnings per share of $3.70 to $3.77 for fiscal 2009, an increase of approximately 6% to 8% over fiscal 2008. Fundamentally, we are cautiously optimistic about fiscal '09. We've not yet seen many signs of a real slowdown in the business but the signs of economic concern are all around us. As a result, we are forecasting revenue growth considerably with a greater opportunity to upside than downside and the commensurate effect on the bottom line. Even in these cautious times, we are forecasting revenue growth and are investing for further opportunity particularly in the Investment Consulting practice.", "Now, I'll walk you through the revenue and margin guidance for each of the segments. Let's start with Benefit. Our Benefit's revenue guidance is 3% to 6% growth in fiscal 2009. Normalizing benefits for the multi-employer business that we exited in fiscal 2008, revenue growth would be 4% to 7%. Benefit ended fiscal 2008 strong. There was uncertain economic conditions, we assumed growth at the low end of our longer-term range. At this time, we think there is probably a greater possibility of exceeding our forecast than falling short. However, we recognize these are uncertain times. We expect margins will continue to be in the high 20% range in fiscal 2009.", "Moving on to the Technology and Administration Solutions Group, we expect revenue growth of 3% to 6% in fiscal 2009. This growth is slightly lower than our longer term expected growth of 5% to 8%. In Europe, we anticipate constant currency growth in fiscal 2009 that is slightly higher than what we achieved in fiscal 2008. In North America, we are expecting our growth rate to decline in fiscal 2009. You will recall that in fiscal 2008, we had approximately $4 million of non-recurring revenues due to system modification made in response to the Pension Protection Act. We are not anticipating yet those will recur. We are also not projecting many new projects in North America in fiscal 2009, as the Pension Administration business and the Benefits enrolment business mature, we expect that more of our growth in North America will come from expansion of services to existing clients. We've got... saw this begin in fiscal 2008. We are encouraged that this price will continue to grow in the down economy.", "Again we think there is greater chance of hitting this forecast than missing it. We expect margins will be in the low to mid 20% range and probably slightly lower than fiscal 2008. We are investing in our talent management software in North America and in a new few clients in Europe, both of which are contributing to the margin decline. Additionally, the non-recurring revenues in fiscal 2008 had no incremental costs.", "Now let's turn to the Human Capital Group. We expect revenue growth of 9% to 12% in fiscal 2009. This growth is consistent with the longer-term growth expectations for this practice. We also expect margins will continue to be in the high teens in fiscal 2009.", "Now we'll discuss Insurance and Financial Services. We expect fiscal 2009 to be a year of recovery for this practice. We are expecting revenue growth of 4% to 7%. We are continuing to build our practice in Asia and expect Asia will account for about a third of the revenue growth. We are expecting modest revenue growth in Europe, but more significant income growth driven by our rightsizing activities in fiscal 2008. We are focused on growing our life insurance consulting practice in North America, we expect margins will be in the high single digits.", "Lastly, we expect Investment Consulting revenues will increase 18% to 21% in fiscal 2009. We are planning to expand our team, especially in Europe in fiscal 2009. We expect margins will be in the low 30% range. After taking into account the year-over-year margin declines in the Technology and Investment Consulting Groups, we are not expecting to achieve year-over-year margin improvement. The investments we are making position us well for future growth. Our fiscal 2009 cost structure can support more revenues that we are anticipating in fiscal 2009.", "Our diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2009 are expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.77, a 6% to 8% increase over fiscal 2008. This guidance assumes a 32.9% tax rate for the year and weighted average shares outstanding of 42.8 million for the year. We are also expecting $4 million of other income in fiscal 2009, due to payments we will receive from the acquires of our multi-employer business. We expect first quarter revenues to range from $433 million to $442 million, and diluted earnings per share to a range from $0.82 to $0.85. First quarter revenue guidance by segment is presented on slide four.", "In summary, we recognized that these are uncertain economic times and we are predicting solid growth for fiscal 2009.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Carl. Before we take your questions, I would like to take this moment to wish my good friend Carl well in retirement and thank him for his service to the firm. I think Carl, we've concluded, this is our 32nd earnings call and every one of them have been a pleasure. So I'm grateful for your counsel and your friendship over the years. It's also my pleasure to welcome Carl's successor, Roger Millay. Roger will not officially join the firm until August 18, but we thought sitting in today's call would be helpful to his transition and Roger, I appreciate your making the time to come down and sit with us through this call. Of course you can hold Roger responsible for anything we're saying today and you can ask him any questions. Roger brings impressive experience to the role and I look forward to working closely with him.", "Now Carl and I will take any questions you may have.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Andrew Fones from UBS. You may proceed, sir.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Thanks. Yes, I'd like to add my best wishes to Carl.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Andrew.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "On the technology business, could you help us understand how long it will take you to work through your current backlog of projects that you are currently implementing? Thanks.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. Let me talk to that and I'd like to talk to both the North American and the European businesses because they're both in some growth situations from [inaudible]. As you note in North America the number of projects in the implementation is down a little bit year-over-year. We are finding the marketplace increasingly price competitive and feel that taking on unprofitable projects is not something in the company's best interest so we've not pursued that. I mentioned that simply to note that the level of activity still seems to be holding pretty well. Those 50 projects will probably drive us... deliver revenue growth through the bulk of 2009 and perhaps a little bit into early the following year.", "We will continue of course to watch the marketplace closely and be bidding on projects where we believe we have an opportunity for profitable revenue growth. In the UK and this is the interesting one, we see some significant growth, there were a number of very significant wins in Europe this year. Ten major clients and some smaller ones, the preparation for that... for those taking those new clients on and bringing them in house has already started and you'll see a little bit of margin pressure in the early quarters of '09, but we will start to see revenue growth coming from them also in the back half of the year. So you should see a slight reduction in the growth rate in the early part of the year. A little bit of compression in the margins and then that opening back up again in the back half of the year.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well just to be clear, I mean these 10 major clients that new clients that we have in the UK as Carl says, the way the model works there when we are doing the implementation we can't charge for all of that works. So we'll be doing\u2026 we'll be having some people working hard on getting all these things ready and then they'll be... then they'll be running profitably. These ten are all really big name clients, one of them is the largest such project we've ever sold. So we're really excited about the prospects forward. It just means our margins will be down a little bit in 2009.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Okay. Thanks. And then, if I could touch on the insurance business, could you just help us understand the impact of the restructuring and the cost savings from that and how that's likely to start the kind of rolling, will we see most of it in Q1 or will it start more in Q2 and so forth? Thanks.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The margin impacts from that will occur of course as the revenue [inaudible] we had completed the rightsizing that was largely in Europe. If you look at the press release and see the headcounts, you will notice that the headcounts have dramatically changed because while we have rightsized in Europe, we've taken advantage of opportunity to grow the business and hire some key folks in Asia but the cost for that rightsizing were all taken care of in fiscal 2008. We would expect those margins to start recovering reasonably rapidly as the revenue starts to come.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I mean, I really think Andrew, I just echo what Carl said. I think we should start to see improvement immediately, it would be our expectation. We did have $900,000 of non-recurring charges in the fourth quarter which were related to the rightsizing and as Carl says there was... a lot of this was some shift of building up some capabilities in some areas of the world and then yet having fewer people in some other areas. So it was a matter of not just the rightsizing in terms of just bringing people having fewer people but also balancing it out and growing in some areas.", "Andrew Fones \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thanks. And then one final, kind of high-level question. In terms of the use of cash, $124 million of cash, no debt, obviously, you got some bonus payments to make here but how's the acquisition pipeline looking, do you have any thoughts to perhaps buying back some stock here? Thanks.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Well, I mean I think as we've always said about cash, we look at the best possible use of that is to do an acquisition and next best is if we can't do an acquisition, we'd probably be to return to the shareholders in some form. Back in February, where we talked about doing the $100 million acquisition, I think we got a question from somebody as to why were we doing a $150 million, and why weren't we doing more like a $150 million or so on that. One of the answers we gave then was even if we were doing the $100 million as fast as we could, we didn't expect to finish till November. So I think, until we get through this, it really doesn't make too much sense to think about whether we would be buying back shares, so we're still trying to complete this one right now. In terms of acquisitions, we are constantly looking for acquisitions. We are constantly talking about them. We have a relatively conservative approach to acquisitions. It's my personal belief that you probably need to do about at least seven or eight good acquisitions for every bad one. So we continue to be careful at looking at them but if we could find the rate of acquisition we'd be anxious to complete that.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Andrew, let me just give a little color around cash flow so you just know what to expect. As you know, that we've got $124 million on the balance sheet as we come to the end of this fiscal year, we'll pay out significant bonuses, the bonus pool, spend at about $184 million so that gives you an idea from the cash demand that we'll see in the first quarter. As usual the first quarter has a negative cash impact when we pay bonuses and taxes. We expect to borrow some money in the first quarter, pay that down so that we are completely out of debt and well ahead by the end of next fiscal year. But you should expect to see some modest debt at the end of the first quarter and then try reducing to the remainder of the year.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Got it. Thank you, that was helpful.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of T.C. Robillard from Bank of America Securities. You may proceed.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Thank you, good morning guys.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "[inaudible] Carl. Again, congratulations on the retirement.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Just wanted to just drill down a little bit more on the operating margin I mean, I think you guys definitely gave some good clarity on it. I just want to make sure, I am understanding something because when I looked at the... the fourth quarter results you saw a pretty good year-on-year increase in both the occupancy and on the salary side. I mean, the salary side obviously sounds like some hiring particularly in Asia, but what drove the occupancy line? I mean is that... is some of that tied in with the Benefits practice or I'm sorry, with the Technology practice or is there something else there that, that I may be missing?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Couple of things, you see the couple of... the insight that will be helpful. First of all, we negotiated our way out some extra space in New York. We got a $1 million lease provision there to take care of that lease loss. You also have the German acquisitions pulling into all the numbers and that makes it different quarter over quarter.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Including the salary.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, yes. You should recognize that the seasonality of the company is fundamentally changing a bit and you start in the fourth quarter, I think we talked about it in May, but the German business has a very strong December quarter and a March quarter, all of their profit comes in those two quarters and by the end of the... end of the fourth quarter there is actually some negative impact on the margin. So you should expect to see a seasonality that's much more like what we've just been through, we'll return to more... our more normal margins in the first quarter of next year.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Okay and then on...", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Did that help?", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Yes, absolutely, thank you. What drove the lower tax rate in the quarter, I apologize if you had said that, I missed it on the prepared remarks.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I didn't say it. Fundamentally the issue with the tax rate is where in the geography around the world the income is generated. And we do our best to forecast that, spend a fair amount of time at it, but if the European business does better and I'm going to say the horrible thing, the actual truth of Europe.. we have lower tax rates in the UK than we do in the U.S., for all of you to note. So when we get strong performance in the UK it does wonderful things to our tax rate.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "So how should... what's your earnings guidance based on from a tax rate standpoint, is it off of kind of a lower kind of 30% to 32% or is it... or should we still be thinking about kind of a 33%, 35% rate?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You should be thinking about a high 32, maybe a... if you guess 33% you'll certainly be safe, my guess is a little bit of opportunity against that. But again, it's a matter of how the European business performed in relation to the North American business to see who has the larger slug in the income.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But our guidance did assume that the tax rate is a little worse in FY '09 than in FY '08.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's correct. We did 32.1% for the year in '08, we're forecasting at 32.9%.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Okay. And then on the discretionary comp. Can you remind me how we should be thinking about that as we're going forward, I mean should that grow roughly in line with pretax income or do you guys think about that a different way. I mean I know you guys accrue for that each quarter. I'm just trying to figure out how we should be thinking about that from a modeling perspective.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We're actually growing the bonus pool and net income at the same rate. So that... so you have a little bit of an iteration there but that's where you should model it.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Okay.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That roughly gets you to the point of growing them both at pre-bonus level except at this year, we're expecting, you heard me reference that $4 million of royalties that we'll be getting from our spin-off business from last... that we spun off last year. So that will move that equation just a little bit.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Okay. And then just a quick housekeeping, and I'll jump in the queue. What were shares out at June 30?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "42... that's right here. 42.8.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "42.8. Great, thanks guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. You may proceed.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Thanks. Nice results, John and Carl.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Ashwin. It's nice to give a message here.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Last time I'm saying nice results, John and Carl, hopefully next time I'll say nice results, John and Roger.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I am sure that you will.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Roger likes that idea a lot, Ashwin.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Roger, welcome.", "Roger F. Millay - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "One of the factors that is given in matter of caution has been sort of line of thinking that says the impact of regulatory reform is one-time in nature with a possible falloff at the back end of such change. My question is what has been your experience with the early adopters of this form? Will it just form a bigger base or does the revenues from those clients drop off?", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I mean Ashwin, as you recall during the last few years as we've had these various regulatory or legislative changes come in. I've been consistently of the opinion that the short-term impact would be a lot less than people thought and the longer-term impact would be longer lasting. And I continue to think that's right, I think so far the results have indicated that belief.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "So you're saying that the base has gotten bigger?", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think what happens is you tend to have a more complex environment, it doesn't tend to be a big bank where there is just a whole lot of work and it disappears.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay. Now, in terms of... and I missed this when you're talking about the admin margins, did the margin pressure due to the UK ramps? Until when do you expect that to last, so how long are these ramps?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I would expect that the pressure will be in the first couple of quarters this year, and you will start to see some improvement, the revenue growth starts to kick in as these clients come on board and the upfront costs, which are largely training and as well as it can't be capitalized or completed.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay. And investment consulting is something going on in the first quarter. It seems to be a little drop-off in the growth rate or is it just a comp issue?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The investment consulting, I would first of all, they're coming off of a very strong year. So I'm not surprised that the growth rates are coming down a little bit. We expect to do some significant hiring in the early part of this year and then through much of the year. Those people will need a chance to get up to speed, but we think that there is lots of opportunity [inaudible] the investment.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay. The income from affiliates? What was that?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We basically have one affiliate, it's our captive insurance company that we own about a third of I guess and we have little visibility, this flows from their creation or release of loss reserves and in this case none of it was related to any of our own cases, it was all coming from other members, other owners that when they release reserves or have to create loss reserves we pick up our share of that and that's what has happened here.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay, now I remember going back to October of last year following the divestiture that you had. There was an expectation I believe that your insurance rates would go down at some point, is that happening in fiscal 09?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In actuality, yes we do have a slight reduction in our insurance costs from '09 to '08.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We do think that the divestiture as a multi-employer practice is probably longer term where we'll really get the benefit from that, Ashwin.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay and my last question and then I'll just hop back in the queue is with regards to... exchange rates have moved obviously unfavorably within the last week or so, is there a view amongst you guys to take sort of a... more of a hedging kind of an approach, I mean you guys don't hedge currently, right?", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We do not try to hedge, certainly not the P&L, we do have some situations where we are having to move currencies back and forth between legal entities and we do watch that pretty carefully, but fundamentally we're not trying to hedge the P&L at all.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No and we think that would be expensive to try to do something like that. We, fundamentally though we tend to have... our people tend to be in the areas where we're operating there and so we have a large portion of our cost there too.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You have a natural hedge at the income line getting both revenue and expense.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's not like we are building a product all in one country and then selling it and distributing it in different countries around the world and we have all of our costs in one country and all the revenue in different ones. So we tend to have that natural hedge anyway.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Right now it's weighed more about the cancellation impact on revenues given what's... given the potential for a stronger unit.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I mean we've taken that into account to be as to the best we can in our guidance and one of the reasons even the years when the currency was helping us, we kept on focusing on the constant currency even though the other results were higher just because we think that that's probably the best long run indicator of what's going on with the business and we still think that's the thing we're focused on for next year.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay, great. Thank you guys", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Brandt Sakakeeny from Deutsche Banc. You may proceed.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc Securities", "Thanks, Carl congratulations on...", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc Securities", "Great help, thanks. On the CapEx, could you give us numbers for both your plans for capitalized software costs as well as PP&E for '09.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "For '09 PP&E, we were looking about $44 million. We got major office buildouts going on and Mary is writing me a note so that I can give you a CapEx number... 5 million?", "Mary Malone - Director of Investor Relations", "No, about the same as this year.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "About the same as this year. Thank you. I didn't have that number at the tip of my tongue.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc Securities", "Okay, so for the capitalized offer [ph], did you say 20 million?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We can just flip to my model, yes.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc Securities", "So, 66 total in CapEx?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, yes.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc Securities", "Great and just on the insurance forecast for FY09, that seems obviously better than what you did in FY08? What are the principal reasons behind, behind the recovery there?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I'm sorry, I didn't get the first part of your question. Which [inaudible].", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc Securities", "Yes, in the end of FY '09 forecast, it looks to be an improvement from FY '08.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc Securities", "Just wanted to push that a little bit and find out what are the factors sort of behind the expectations?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. We had... we continue to have great expectations and strong performance in Asia last year that we'll continue with the practice, you'll see a greater increase in profitability than you do in revenue because we've rightsized in Europe. I'm cautious [inaudible] tell me I shouldn't be quite so cautious but we think we're... that's where the revenue growth is going to come from.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc Securities", "Okay, are you gaining any traction in the U.S.?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We've rightsized the U.S. business also so that it can become profitable. We're not getting the kind of traction we'd like to have. The life... we're going to continue to build the life business and to we can make of that, but fundamentally, we're not getting the kind of traction we would like to have.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc Securities", "All right, great and John, do you mind just talking to the acquisition pipeline, really just specifically are there geographies or practices that you're really focused on right now for FY '09 and FY '10?", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I mean, I think Brandt there is a... there is a number of potential acquisitions we are looking at out there. I would say most of them are not necessarily all that big. There is nothing that we see is a big hole the way we saw not having significant operations in Germany or the Netherlands. We thought those were big holes that needed to be filled. I don't think we see the same, I think we see some interesting opportunities out there, but nothing that is sort of a burning need the way those were.", "Brandt Sakakeeny - Deutsche Banc Securities", "Okay, great, thanks very much and welcome to Roger as well.", "Roger F. Millay - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. You may proceed.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good morning and congratulations to the entire team.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Obviously, great congratulations to Carl and welcome, Roger, I have heard some great things about you.", "Roger F. Millay - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks very much.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Wondering, with regards to the Investment Consulting division. John, you mentioned a little bit about the uncertainty out there. I was wondering if you could amplify your comments a little bit or expand on with regards to what are some of the positives and some of the minuses that we could face this year in the investment consulting arena and particularly you mentioned there is volatility and so maybe there's... it seemed like that would be a positive but it also sounded like you were cautioning that there could be some negative ramifications from that as well?", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think you first of all in general if we look back over the longer run for our Investment Consulting model, when you tend to have... when you tend to have tough times, people tend to look for more investment consulting and so we've... we tend to see downtimes as something where maybe that's not so bad for the whole Investment Consulting model. In the remarks I was talking about our market conditions impacting liquidity and pricing for clients wanting to hedge liability risks and so what we were really saying is the possibilities for them to be doing some sophisticated hedging may not be there as much next year as they had been that year and it could hurt that particular part of the business.", "Overall though we've had several years of very high growth for investment consulting. We're still thinking we're going to grow at a very high rate for next year and in fact, indeed we think we're going to grow at a very high rate for several more years at least. Maybe not quite as high as the last few years but we still think that this is a very attractive business and one which is going to continue to do well. One of the things that is impacting it a little bit is we are investing in this business. We're looking to hire a fair number of people and to expand our capability. So we think now is exactly the right time to be doing that. So that's bringing down the margins a little bit. I think we're hiring about 85 people is what we're bringing in but overall, I think we're reasonably bullish and I think if you were to ask me in general tough times probably add more to investment consulting rather than subtract from it.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, so you were just talking about that one particular facet, but on the balance things should [inaudible]?", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right, I was just... exactly, I was just talking about that one particular facet. Now to the extent we get success fees for doing better than benchmarks. We've gotten some success fees over the last few years, that's been in an up market. Will we also perform better if there is a down market or something, I think that remains to be seen too.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and then can you talk, you've made some comments about obviously the economy is on everybody's mind, when you're making your comments with regards to just being consciously optimistic and obviously the economy being the negative constrain. Were you referring specifically to the U.S. or were you making comments on a worldwide basis and I'm wondering what are you hearing from your international offices as it relates to demand for services on a global basis given the economic uncertainties, do you see the fear spreading or are people still fairly sanguine?", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think, I would say that there is two components to this. First of all, we were talking on a global basis about... when we were mentioning uncertainty. If we look at the... just what's happening with our business and what's happening with our clients. I think, we don't see... things still look pretty strong, things have looked strong all of fiscal '08, they look strong at the moment right now and so we're feeling pretty good about what's going on. We can't help but look at the world around us though and note that there is a lot of people with a lot of concerns about what's going on. About six months ago, we were hearing that more from the U.S. than we were from say Europe and I think today we would probably hear more concerns expressed from Europe than we would from the U.S.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, but your guidance is taking that all into account and you're still going to be conservative?", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Our guidance is taking that all into account, we're trying to be somewhat conservative, I think if you look at it, we grew about 8% on a constant currency basis organic in FY'08 and we have a...we're saying we're going to grow in the 5% to 8% range for FY'09. However for a couple of significant things we're not projecting any margin improvement and I think that's probably where we have some conservatism involved in everything. But we think it's a... we've talked about is how conservative is this. We don't think it's terribly conservative, we think it's a little bit conservative.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Now, this is the first time you've admitted to being conservative on a call. So...", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You know what Mark, you just beat over the head with us so many quarters.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "So one thing on the compensation and professional services, particularly the compensation. How should we think about the increase that we saw this last quarter from a couple of perspectives. I guess one perspective would be things are going extremely well right now. If you wanted to invest during this period, this would... you certainly have covered to do that and particularly in light of future anticipated demand. So that would be one reason for comp going up. The other factor would be things are going well and your consultants are probably in high demand and may have higher expectations for their own compensations. So I'm wondering, is that when we looked at this compensation this quarter, should we think about it more as the former or the latter? How does it... I'm sure it's a blend of the two but how... which way this would skew more?", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as Carl mentioned, some of the salary costs are up, if you have to factor in acquisitions like Heissmann. Are you looking sequential, or are you looking year-over-year?", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "I'm thinking about it both ways.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. Year-over-year, I think John is exactly right. It's Heissmann which was a pretty good group of folks and you shouldn't be surprised at that. You should think about compensation going up in '09, we're going to add as we've noted to you, we have added a fair number of folks and we're going to add a fair number of folks in the investment consulting practice, probably half of that 85 folks is going to come in the first quarter. And so you'll start to see a little bit of increase there. A little bit of it is the cost of doing some of the rightsizing but I don't think you should beyond what we specifically talked about, you should not... as you're looking at it sequentially, I think that there is going to be dramatic increase sequentially.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I would say a couple of things though just to add to that, Mark. We... as we do better, as an organization, as you know our philosophy is that we should reward our stakeholders equally. And so we grow our after-tax net income and we grow our bonus pool at exactly the same rates. And so, our earnings went up about 34% this year. The amount of money we allocated, the bonuses went up 34%. So, we are able to continue to reward our associates and to make sure that they're paid at for all the great results that they have been achieving. We look to continue that going forward, we want to make sure that we're rewarding our associates and paying them fairly. I think we do think that there are some attractive opportunities for us to invest now but we're going to do that on a cautious basis also.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Great. And then the last question and I'll hop back in the queue. The affiliate income obviously that swings around quite a bit. What are your expectations for that number, that's baked into your forecasts?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We tend to be... I am not going to use that C word, I certainly won't admit to that, but anyway, we don't expect this to repeat next year and so we get zero built-in.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Zero built-in?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "What's the probability of zero coming through?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "My view is that we're seeing better and better performance in the loss areas. So I think that's a reasonable estimate. I would guess that we might... the probability that we might do a little bit better than that is higher than the probability that we would do worse.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Right, thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. You may proceed.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Hi, thank you for squeezing me in over here. Just a few follow-up questions. You talked about increased competition in investment consulting group, actually I want to ask you if you are seeing an increased competition in investment consulting group, you guys are doing very well in that area and I know some of your competitors are trying to either re-build or continue to build their practices in that area?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Generally no, we are not seeing much in the way of increased competition there. I mean I guess that we... the kind of services we're offering, we're not seeing much competition for that.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Okay, and you talked in the TAS Group that you're seeing some increased competition and so you don't want to go after unprofitable business, which is good. I'm just wondering where is the competition coming from, in other words, can you talk about some of the players, or is there increased competition from existing players, are there additional players that are pushing into that business?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, this is one of these markets that is subject to swings from time to time. A particular organization may decide they need to get some business and they will come in with some very low ball prices for something and then they will get the business and go away, and we'll go back to normal pricing. We've just been seeing a little bit more of these kinds of fluctuations over the last six months. We've concluded that we'd rather just sit that out a little bit and make sure that we don't get sucked in any of these unprofitable ones.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Shlomo, I would only add to that, if I may, that it's the North American business where we're seeing that pricing competition. In Europe, the pricing competition has always been there and that's one of the reasons why we are so very excited about the significant wins of these major new clients in Europe. We have been able to price to be profitable in Europe. Our reputation and the brand are very strong and so we've had... it just makes it a little more exciting.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. And can you just talk a little bit more about the cash flow, I didn't get it totally straight. What we should expect in terms of the bonus payouts and maybe reversal of some of the positive working capital items going into next quarter?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We will pay bonuses in the September time frame of about $184 million, we'll use the bonus, that's why we accrued and we will pay taxes. So we anticipate probably borrowing about $80 million by the end of the quarter, obviously getting a little bit of cash. That we will then pay down gradually over the ensuing couple of quarters also while we finish the share repurchase so that by this time next year we'll have probably enough cash on the balance sheet to cover the bonuses and not have to borrow at all.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's been our traditional pattern.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. And if you could just talk a little bit more in terms of the strength in retirement services, can you just talk about where we're strongest, is there a particular area of work where you're seeing strength, if you'd just talk giving some specifics in that area?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You're talking about our retirement consulting business, we think...", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Yes.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We're very strong, a dominant player in the UK, very strong competitive player amongst the four who are the major competitors in the U.S. I'm not sure I'm answering your question, I'm not quite sure I understand the question.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think there's... I don't think, maybe I could just answer it in another way, I think what Carl is trying to say is we... there is not one specific area, either geographically or practice-wise [ph] that we would say this is where the strength of our business is. We are a... we're strong across all areas of retirement and really across all geographies.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. That is what I was asking. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from the line of T.C. Robillard from Bank of America Securities. You may proceed.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Great. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the insurance practice to an earlier question. In your guidance for fiscal '09, are you expecting to see traction pick up again in the US or are you expecting the US to be rightsized from a cost perspective but still kind of treading water from a revenue perspective.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The major sources of growth that we're expecting in the insurance practice will come in Asia and Europe. Europe will also contribute more to the profitability because of the rightsizing there. We're not anticipating a huge growth in the United States. We do expect them to grow a little bit and to do some profit but the big players will be as we noted Europe with some contribution from Asia.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Okay. And then just on the headcount for that practice, it was up 8% year-on-year and you guys obviously touched on that and what was driving that but, considering where we're rightsize, should we be expecting much growth in headcount as we're looking forward, the fiscal basis, fiscal '09?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In the insurance practice?", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "In the insurance practice specifically.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, I wouldn't anticipate that I think that's largely done.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. You may proceed.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "As we look out towards next year or I guess this year, what should our expectations be in terms of overall headcount growth and which practices would you expect to increase the most?", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You should expect headcount increase in the investment consulting practice as we talked about.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Yes.", "Carl D. Mautz - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We will do our normal hiring in the retirement practice around as well as we keep the pipeline full and but I don't know that's necessarily going to lead to increases in headcount, we have been gradually reducing headcount over time there and getting more efficiencies out of the practice. So I wouldn't expect significant headcount increases there. I would guess that other than in investment consulting, you're going to be...", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, could I maybe, just to sum this up Mark, we've already made some hires for FY '09 in two practices. One of them is in insurance as Carl has mentioned and the other is in TAS, Technology Administration Solutions, particularly TAS in Europe for those 10 major clients that we're working on those. Those people have already been hired and are on board. So we have those, the only one that we're really saying then leaving those two aside, the only one where we think we're going to be adding people in FY '09 to a significant grade is in investment consulting.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And what... in general, I would assume that you're still going to see some increases in most of the other practices, what would that generally be or should it be flat?", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we will... we are going to be continuing to hire people, but we think it will be... it will probably be closer to a constant or a very, a percent or two increase.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay and that's what I was trying to get at a little bit earlier, it seems like maybe you've invested a little bit in front of '09 in '08.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And then...", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Particularly in those two practices we mentioned, yes.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Yes. And you're obviously right in the nation's capital, are you still led there maybe heightened sensitivity to that where regardless no matter what we're going to have some form of an administration change. What do you think the impact would be if we do have an administrative change in terms of the potential for increased consulting work just around potential new legislation, is that baked into your forecast at all or how do you think about it?", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We haven't baked that into our forecast, we've tried to think about that a little bit, I guess the.... there is lots of different scenarios that you can concoct for this. Overall though change tends to favor consulting firms and the more change the more it tends to favor them. So I think, if you were to get a democratic administration in, you probably have more change than if you were to continue with a Republican administration you might think that that would be a little bit better for us.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But I don't think... I think in any event we don't see any big negatives coming in from either candidate in terms of this would be bad for business and I don't think we necessarily see anything to say this would be great for business either.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "That's fair. Thank you.", "Operator", "And at this time, there is no further questions in the queue. I will pass the call over to Mr. John Haley for closing remarks.", "John J. Haley - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thanks again everybody for joining us. We look forward to seeing you at our upcoming Analyst Day, which will be September 17th in our New York City office. Good bye.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

I am pleased to share the results of our fiscal year \u201909 first quarter with you.  Our revenues for the quarter increased to 426 million, an increase of 6% over prior year.  On a constant currency basis, our revenues increased 7% over prior year.  Our segment revenue growth on a constant currency basis was quite good during the quarter \u2013 6% in benefits, 21% in technology and administration solutions, 15% in the human capital group, 2% in insurance and financial services, and 9% in investment consulting.  For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $.82.  This is a 6% increase over the prior year period of $.77 per share.  The strengthening of the US dollar resulted in a $.02 reduction to our EPS.  On a constant currency basis, diluted earnings per share were $.84, a 9% increase over prior year.  Our EPS growth resulted primarily from our increase in revenues and the decrease in shares outstanding.  The increase in non-operating items also contributed.  The growth in our operating income is masked by the strengthening of the US dollar.  On a constant currency basis, our operating margin was 12.3% for the quarter and our operating income resulted in $.02 more of earnings per share.", "We had the strongest stable business and have performed well in these challenging economic times.  While we would prefer to work in a good economy, we have been here before and are well positioned to weather this economic downturn.  Our services are well aligned with changing market demands.  We are a conservatively managed company with excellent cash flow and a strong balance sheet.  Now, let\u2019s review each of our segments, beginning with benefits.", "For the quarter, benefits group revenues were 238 million, up 5% from the prior year and 6% on a constant currency basis.  We experienced decreased demand for our services in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.  Growth would have been 1 point higher if we adjusted for the spin-off of the multi-employer retirement business in North America in February 2008.  We have a large base of recurring services that our clients need in all economic environments.  Additionally, pension plan sponsors across the globe face an array of complex financial risk and demographic issues.  We expect demand for our retirement services will continue.  ", "We think that the current financial crisis will highlight the relative pros and cons of defined benefit pensions and defined contribution plans.  For employees, the predictable, mainly guaranteed income of pensions contrasts sharply with the day-to-day fluctuation of defined contribution plan account values, which are wreaking havoc on planned retirements.  For employers, defined benefit plan sponsors have significant cash flow planning work to do as a result of the financial crises and the recent law changes.  We expect significant dialog with our clients on these issues.  Now let\u2019s move on to the Technology and Administration Solutions group.", "For the quarter, revenues were $48 million, up 18% from prior year and 21% on a constant currency basis.  We performed better than we expected in both Europe and North America, primarily due to additional project work at existing clients.  As this practice matures in North America and we have more clients in ongoing service delivery, our base of recurring revenue increases.  When projects move from implementation into ongoing service delivery, we begin recognizing revenues and this provides growth over the prior period.  We also achieved growth this quarter from additional project work at existing clients.  As compared to prior year, we had more project work at existing clients, and less project implementation work.  This change in the mix of work contributed to our high growth rate, because of the deferral accounting required for project implementation work.  We had 164 projects and service delivery at the end of September 2008, up from 95 at the end of September 2007.  At the end of September 2008, we had another 59 projects in implementation.  We continue to have an excellent retention rate.  ", "We are also performing well in Europe and have excellent retention there, too.  Virtually all of our revenues in Europe are from ongoing administration work.  We have a stable platform of revenues in this segment and there is some visibility into our growth.  As companies continue to take a hard look at how they administer their benefit, retirement management and compensation programs, we expect additional growth opportunities will arise.  The administration services that we provide are a compelling proposition for companies looking to control costs, improve employee engagement and productivity, and free up the HR function for more strategic efforts.  ", "Next, let me turn to the Human Capital group.  For the quarter, revenues were $50 million, up 16% from prior year and 15% on a constant currency basis.  This is the only segment where we benefited from the movement in foreign exchange rates.  As compared to prior year average exchange rates, the Euro appreciated and the British Pound depreciated.  In this one segment, we have more Euro denominated revenues than Pound denominated revenues.  We experienced growth in both Human Capital consulting projects and data services.  Demand was especially strong for compensation work.  Executive pay remains under scrutiny and demand for our services should continue.  The Human Capital group has been our most cyclical segment in the past, but our services have become more governance and compliance focused.  This is also our most geographically diverse segment, and we expect to grow in all geographic regions.  This segment performed well in the first quarter, and we expect it will perform well for the remainder of the fiscal year.  ", "Now we\u2019ll discuss the Insurance and Financial Services group.  For the quarter, revenues were $28 million, consistent with prior year and a 2% increase on a constant currency basis.  Our clients in this segment have been the hardest hit by the current financial crisis.  We view the current situation as a mixture of good news and bad news.  In the short term, we think the turmoil will create opportunities for us, but we also expect that some clients will defer or cancel projects due to cost constraints.  We have already started work on one very large project and there are several other projects on which we are proposing.  As of now, we expect to meet our original forecast for the year.  We can\u2019t overlook the fact that there will probably be significant restructuring within the insurance and financial services industry over the next few months and years.  There is some uncertainty as to the eventual outcome, but we think that we are well positioned to respond quickly to the needs of our clients.  We expect most of the project work in the next couple of quarters will be transaction related work. ", "Lastly, Investment Consulting reported revenues of $42 million for the quarter, an increase 5% from prior year and 9% on a constant currency basis.  This is the segment that has been most impacted by the current financial crisis.  ", "There continues to be a demand for our services, but the lack of liquidity and unattractive pricing have delayed our ability to execute certain projects.  Also, at this time, some of our best advice affects our ability to earn immediate revenues.  We\u2019ve recently been advising our clients not to change managers and to defer making certain types of investments.  While advice not to do something can be extremely valuable, it is not usually revenue generating.  But we do what is in the best interest of our clients, knowing that this will serve our business well for the future.  Many of our clients are looking at their investment strategy and are considering what to do when the markets settle.  We continue to be optimistic about the longer term growth prospects for this segment, but it\u2019s growth will be more moderate for this fiscal year.  ", "Given the turbulent markets and our more moderate growth expectations for this fiscal year, we are deferring planned head-count increases as appropriate on a market by market basis, until we see clear signs of additional growth momentum.  ", "Wrapping up, we performed well despite the challenging economic times.  The most important thing we are doing is staying close to our clients.  We are cautiously optimistic about our growth opportunities for the remainder of this fiscal year.  Now I will turn the call over to Roger.  ", "Roger F. Millay - CFO", "Thanks, John.  Good morning to everyone.  As you\u2019ve just heard, we\u2019ve experienced good growth in our first fiscal quarter.  For the quarter we reported revenues of $426 million and diluted EPS of $.82.  On a constant currency basis, total revenues were $431 million, resulting in 7% growth over last year.  On a constant currency basis, our diluted EPS was $.84, an increase of 9% over last year.  The Benefits group had a 27% margin for the quarter, and increase from 25% last year.  The margin improvement over prior year was driven by North America.  Benefits tends to have even higher margins in the back half of the fiscal year, we are still expecting full-year margins consistent with prior year, in the high 20% range.  Technology and Administration Solutions had a 27% margin for the quarter, and increase from 21% last year.  The increase is due primarily to the additional project work in Europe and North America.  The deferral accounting required for systems implementations in North America makes it challenging to predict the margins within this segment.  We still expect full year margins will be in the low to mid 20% range, and probably slightly lower than fiscal 2008.  ", "Please remember that the margins in our second quarter of fiscal 2008 were higher than normal due to additional project work in North America.  Human Capital group had a 14% margin for the quarter, up slightly from 13% last year, driven by Data Services.  We expect margins will be in the mid to high teens for the full year.  Margins vary somewhat in our different geographic regions and a change in geographic mix could have a slight impact on the overall margin.  ", "Insurance and Financial Services had a 3% margin for the quarter, a decrease from 5% last year.  Margin improvement in Europe was offset by lower margins in North America and Asia Pacific.  We still expect margins will be in the high single digits for the year.  Investment Consulting had a 30% margin for the quarter, a decrease from 35% last year.  Margins were down in both North America and Europe, as compared to prior year.  We\u2019ve had significant hiring plans for fiscal 2009 in this practice, and we\u2019ve made most of those hires to support our past growth and to position ourselves for future growth.  We\u2019ve made some hires to bolster our research capabilities and some that are client facing.  For fiscal 2009, margins may drop below 30% into the high 20% range.  ", "In fiscal 2009, our costs increased to include the talent and skills needed for the long term, but our revenues incorporate the negative impact of continued market turmoil for the remainder of the fiscal year.   We continue to think that the long term prospects are good for this practice.  The segment margins that we\u2019ve just reviewed are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles resulting from our acquisitions.  For the quarter, our operating income margin was 12.0%, a decline from 12.8% in the prior year quarter.  The quarter over quarter decline is due to the decrease in investment consulting margins and the strengthening of the US dollar.  ", "Net income for the quarter was $35 million, up from $34 million in the prior year.  Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $.82 as compared to first quarter earnings per share of $.77. On a constant currency basis deluded earnings per share for the quarter were $.84. Before moving to the balance sheet, I want to mention that we\u2019ve reformatted our headcount disclosure to be more consistent with how we report headcount internally. Also, we incorrectly reported our June 30 headcount, and that\u2019s been corrected in today\u2019s press release. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $67 million of cash and $105 million of debt. You\u2019ll recall that we typically have some borrowings during the first quarter, due to the seasonality of our business. We expect to have the debt repaid by the end of the fiscal year. We also used $74 million to repurchase shares during the quarter. We have now completed our planned $100 million share repurchase. ", "Our business will continue to generate strong cash flows this fiscal year. Our liquidity position is also very strong. We have an additional $195 million available under our line of credit that we don\u2019t expect to need. We drew under our revolving line in September with no issues. Our bank deal matures in 2010. ", "Now let\u2019s review our guidance for fiscal 2009. The slides posted on our Web site may be helpful for following along in this section. On a constant currency basis we are confirming full year guidance of revenues in the range of $1.85 billion to $1.90 billion, and deluded earnings per share in the range of $3.72 to $3.79. Constant currency is calculated using prior year average exchange rates. The revenues and deluded earnings per share that we report will continue to be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. We certainly don\u2019t know how exchange rates will fluctuate over the remainder of our fiscal year. After considering the volatile foreign exchange markets and our company forecast we expect reported revenues will be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.81 billion. And reported deluded earnings per share will be in the range of $3.50 to $3.57. This is the same EPS guidance that we provided in the September analyst meeting. ", "Generally speaking, a little less than half of our business is in Europe, and a 10% drop in the pound and the Euro will result in about a 5% drop in our EPS over the remainder of the fiscal year. The UK is about three quarters of our European business, so changes in the pound affect our results more than changes in the Euro. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about fiscal \u201809. We\u2019re not seeing any real signs of a slow down in the business, but the signs of economic concern are all around us. ", "Now, I\u2019ll walk through the revenue guidance for each of the segments. Please note that the slides on our Web site show both reported and constant currency revenue guidance. Since constant currency is the better measure of underlined business performance, I\u2019ll focus my remarks on the constant currency guidance. Let\u2019s start with benefits. ", "Our benefits constant currency revenue guidance is 4% to 6% growth in fiscal 2009. Normalizing benefits for the multi-employer business that we exited in fiscal 2008, revenue growth would be 5% to 7%. We\u2019ve increased the low end of the range based on our results for the first quarter, and our sense of the business pipeline. ", "In the technology and administration solutions group, we\u2019re increasing our constant currency revenue guidance to 7% to 10% growth in fiscal 2009. The increase reflects the mix of work in our pipeline in North America, and the progress of our new client installations in Europe. ", "In the human capital group we expect constant currency revenue growth of 9% to 12% in fiscal 2009, which is consistent with our previous constant currency guidance. In insurance and financial services, we still expect fiscal 2009 to be a year of recovery for this practice, and we\u2019re keeping our previous constant currency guidance. We expect constant currency revenue growth of 4% to 7%. Lastly, we\u2019re revising our constant currency investment consulting revenue growth down to 10% to 13% in fiscal 2009. This downward revision to our guidance is due to the delays in executing projects on behalf of our clients, and assumes that market conditions continue to be difficult for the remainder of our fiscal year. ", "These are tumultuous economic times for everyone. Despite this environment, we continue to expect to achieve constant currency revenue growth in each of our segments. We expect reported second quarter revenues will be in the range of $422 million to $432 million. And reported deluded EPS will be in the range of $.75 to $.79. On a constant currency basis, we expect second quarter revenues to be in the range of $456 million to $466 million. And deluded EPS to be in the range of $.82 to $.86. Second quarter revenue guidance by segment is presented on slide four. ", "You\u2019ll recall that the second quarter fiscal \u201908 was a good quarter for us, and provides a tough comparison for second quarter of this year. We had really strong margins in the second quarter of fiscal \u201908 in our technology group from some project group around the implementation of the Pension Protection Act and in our human capital group from the timing of some of our data services work. Consistent with the prior year, we expect to generate more than half of our earnings in the second half of the fiscal year, and we expect the third quarter to be our strongest quarter. ", "In summary, we continue to believe that we\u2019ll deliver strong earnings and cash flow results for the year in the local markets of our business across the world. However, the stability of our underlying business is somewhat masked by the changes in foreign exchange rates. I have to say that it\u2019s hard see that we\u2019re getting full credit for this earnings and cash flow resilience in our current valuation.", "Carl D. Mautz - VP and CFO", "", "Thanks, Roger. Now we\u2019ll take any questions that you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. If you wish to ask a question please press star followed by one on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to withdraw your question, please dial star followed by two. Questions will be taken in the order received, and please press star one to begin. And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Fones of UBS. Please proceed, sir. ", "Andrew Fones \u2013 UBS:", "Thanks, yes, I had a question about your full year guidance. Going through the margin guidance that you mentioned I think you said that you were looking for slightly lower margins in investment consulting and also the HCG group than you had given previously. And you\u2019ve also lowered the growth expectation for your highest margin, business consulting business. Despite that you\u2019re maintaining your EPS guidance, so should we assume, from this, that you\u2019re now anticipating slightly lower discretionary compensation expenses? Do you think?", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "I think you had several questions in there, but as you know, I think, and as everyone knows, we mark the discretionary compensation level to growth and earnings per share, or net income, so those will move in tandem. In terms of the guidance overall, we have maintained our guidance, and as I think I\u2019ve said in my remarks, we ran scenarios and we recognized that FX rates were a little bit lower than when we met at the analyst meeting, but the puts and takes of different practices as well as looking at the momentum of costs, we\u2019re maintaining guidance. So there is a mix in there, as you said, some are down but also some are up. ", "Andrew Fones \u2013 UBS:", "OK, thanks. I also just kind of wanted to ask a little bit on the technology business you\u2019ve mentioned in the past. You\u2019ve won a lot of large projects in Europe. I was wondering if you could give us kind of an update of when you expect those to kind of impact revenue and what the margin impact could be? Thanks.", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "Well, I think actually those projects started to come in in a small way this quarter, and I think the expectations were laid out for the year. They will come in across the year. One of the elements of the margin changes in that business for this year is that we do continue to incur costs to ramp up those projects, and again they\u2019ll come in as the year goes by. So the maturation of those projects in incorporated in our guidance. ", "Andrew Fones \u2013 UBS:", "", "OK, and can I ask what the impact of those costs on the margins this year? ", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "I don\u2019t have a specific number on the cost impact of those specific ramp-ups.", "Carl D. Mautz - VP and CFO:", "Andrew, can I just clarify something too? I think in the first question you asked Roger you were suggesting that we had said that the human capital group would have declining margins this year, and actually we\u2019re not suggesting that. ", "Andrew Fones \u2013 UBS:", "No, I think it sounded as though it was slightly lower than your prior guidance and you said mid to high teens and I may be wrong but I thought your old guidance was high teens.", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "", "I think that\u2019s what I referred to in the mix of geographic regions may have a little impact. I mean, we don\u2019t see that as a big change, but\u2026", "Andrew Fones \u2013 UBS:", "OK, so it sounds like it\u2019s a small change. And a kind of final question, I wanted to ask about the insurance business. You saw a kind of acceleration in business that looks like you expect further acceleration as you go through the year. If you could kind of talk about what\u2019s driving that, thanks.", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", " I think what we see with the insurance, we had a 2% revenue growth this quarter, but we expect to see some more transaction related business in the quarter, I mean in the remainder of the fiscal year. We do think there will be some consolidation in this industry. Now, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we also think we may see some projects delayed or deferred in this segment also, but we think the transaction related work will probably be a little more significant. We have one very large transaction related project which we\u2019ve already started work on.", "Andrew Fones \u2013 UBS:", "OK, thanks very much.", "Moderator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of T.C. Robillard of Bank of America Securities. Please proceed.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Great, thank you, good morning everyone. I just wanted to just dig down a little bit more into the margin side. I know that on a reported basis it\u2019s going to be difficult because it\u2019s a combination of revenue mix as well as FX issues. But am I coming away thinking from your prepared comments, that if we look on a reported basis you had on a year and year 80 basis point loss on the Ibit margins. It sounded like 30 basis points was FX related, which means 50 basis points came from the investment consulting group. Am I understanding correctly, that just 10% of your revenue base at that margin, on a year on year basis coming down was all of the Ibit difference?", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "I think the way you\u2019re looking at it is, you know, there are a lot of influencing factors that go in there. But as I said in the remarks the investment consulting and FX \u2013 the 30 basis points that you referred to \u2013 are the two big drivers.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "OK, and so as we\u2019re going forward then it just looks based off of your guidance, at least as I\u2019m looking on the second quarter, you guys are expecting a much more rapid year on year decline. And I understand in that second quarter last year had some unique items that made it artificially high, but it seems to me \u2013 and this is just kind of a rough cut \u2013 are we expecting kind of further deterioration just in kind of core margins? On a constant currency basis, excluding any of the fluctuations in FX?", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "I don\u2019t think we see anything significant, I think we would have pointed it out if there was. So I think we expect to be around this range for the year. Also, just to point out that the second quarter is the lowest margin quarter for the year.", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "And then, to switch over to the technology group, it looked like you guys had a sort of large increase in new project signings. If you just kind of take the conversions that you had, versus the sequential increase in implementation projects. Can you give us a sense as to where you guys are seeing some good success on new wins, whether it\u2019s geographic or any other way you can kind of break that down?", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "North America has been doing well in terms of, again, the types of projects we\u2019re able to recognize revenue up front and it's compensation and reward related projects. ", "", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "And is this similar, are you still saying in terms of your new signings, big signings that you guys have pointed out over the last several quarters, that a lot of your new signings tend to big bigger in terms of revenue opportunity. Is that the same or was this more of a larger number of rather smaller signings?", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "I think for the most part it's smaller type projects. ", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Okay, and then, just lastly and then I'll jump back in the queue. Any thoughts on further buy backs now that you guys have just given away your stock [ends] and the fact that you've  completed the $100 million that you originally announced?", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "We haven't had any definitive conclusions on that. But we'll continue to look at it as time goes by. But, as you say, from a pure stock price point of view, it's attractive now. But there are other factors we'll be considering. ", "T.C. Robillard - Bank of America", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Geo, CEO of Deutsche Banc. Please proceed.", "Paul Geo - Deutsche Banc ", "Thanks. I just have questions about the insurance and financial services division.  I'm just wonder if any of your bigger clients, particularly AIG or some of the other financial services companies that are out of business now, if they're in your [clientage]?", "That project, is it related to one of the headline mergers that we have recently seen? Thanks. ", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "We're not in a position to talk about who that project is for or what it relates to.", "So, I think we've tended to have relationships with a wide variety of players in the insurance market though, and as you know we're quite strong in those markets in both Europe and Asia Pacific, and so we do have a wide variety of clients. ", "Paul   - Deutsche Banc Securities", "", "So, if [recording drop] we shouldn't expect any, although you made comments earlier but, There's only been a couple of insurance companies, maybe just one in the current business. It doesn't sound like it's something you are concerned about.   ", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "No. I think we're concerned about how the financial crisis has hit the insurance companies and we are somewhat concerned about some retrenchment in this area as we've mentioned in some projects by insurance companies. ", "But we also think that combined with that, we will see some increasing consolidation in that market. And as there's consolidation, there's a lot of wok for us on transaction related projects. So I think we see some parts of what we do perhaps decreasing or being deferred. But we see some parts perhaps increasing. ", "", "Paul   - Deutsche Banc Securities", "", "Great, Thanks. Let me ask you another question about the guidance.  I have estimated about a $0.12 hit just from your September 17 guidance from the currency. It's moved against you 8% since your September, 17 [versterday yet].  ", "You're not changing your guidance. But you're [konsekrensing] guidance goes up $0.02. ", "It just doesn't seem to make sense to me. Is there some difference between them? Because it seems that, the FEX hit on September 17 is bigger than you're implying between your two guidances. ", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "Yes. We did struggle with this because FEX has been bouncing all over the place. But again, as I referred to earlier, what we've really  been doing over that last few days is running various scenarios of where we expect operations to come out and where FEX has been, and in those scenarios, our range held. ", "Paul   - Deutsche Banc Securities", "Following up from that, it sounds like underlying upgrade X currency is maybe bigger than the $0.02 that's it's implying. At least that's what my calculation\u2026", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "And the $0.02 you're referring to; we held our constant currency guidance. So, ", "Paul   - Deutsche Banc Securities", "", "Right. So I would expect your currency guidance to come down more with the FEX. It didn't. ", "", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "It didn't. That's what I'm saying. Again, as we ran scenarios of where FEX was and what we expect out of the operations for the rest of the year, we held the range.", "Paul   - Deutsche Banc Securities", "", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "You next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar  of Citigroup. Please proceed. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Thanks. Congratulations, guys, especially keeping your guidance. Obviously that's a good thing. ", "Roger F. Millay \u2013 CFO:", "Thanks Ashwin", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Given the market performance is there any heightened attention to pensions this year, both in terms of new potential business and [do you expect] lame duck congress when it comes back to push through in eight weeks to pension... ", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "Yeah, there are three areas that I would point to, generally.  One is the, we mentioned in the prepared remarks the relative attractiveness of defined benefit pensions versus defined contribution pension plans, and this kind of an environment shows some of the reasons why some plan sponsors and some employees prefer defined benefit plans; the stability that you have during a crisis like this. So, I think there will be some work to think about what role and what mix they should play in an employer\u2019s portfolio of plans.  ", "There are also issues around funding and accounting expense and even investment policy that will arise from the volatility in the markets, and it is one of the reasons why we have continued to see a lot of work in the benefits business and we expect to continue to see a lot of work for the remainder of the fiscal year.  And then, finally, some of the provisions of the Pension Protection Act would require contributions that are higher in the short run than may be advisable, and I think there are a number of actors who have encouraged congress to think about those provisions and take a good hard look at them when they get back, and I expect that that will be going on. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "OK, moving to the cash flow performance, and outlook.  Would you expect the cash flow for 2009, the operating cash flow, to be better than 2008, especially after the extenuating variable compensational?", "", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", " ", "We had for fiscal 2008, if I am remembering the numbers correctly, a very strong free cash and operating cash flow performance and higher than the prior couple of years, so I don\u2019t think we are saying that we are going to have more, I think there were some things that related to some of the acquisition activity in \u201908 and \u201907 that made that made \u201908 a strong year.  So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing more, we\u2019re seeing a good cash flow year.  I think that the guidance that had been given for just cash balances for the year was $195 million and we are holding that and we expect, as we said, a good cash year still, even though free cash, not gone up from regular operations, but free cash to be probably a little bit lower than it was in \u201908.  ", "Roger F. Millay - CFO", "And then finally, Ashwin, you asked about the effect of discretionary compensation, and let me just remind you that our policy is to try to increase discretionary compensation the same way that net income increases.  So we saw a 2% increase in net income this quarter, so we had a 2% increase in discretionary compensation.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Ok, Roger, thank you.", "Operator", "Ok, our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird, please proceed.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Good morning, can you say specifically what your affect assumptions are for going forward, Pound and Euro?", "Roger F. Millay - CFO", "No, because as I\u2019ve said, just given how much affects has been bouncing around, the approach we took this time was we did run scenarios and we don\u2019t have one specific assumption.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Can you say what the range of assumptions would be in?", "Roger F. Millay - CFO", "Well, I\u2019d just say that we were doing all this work last week, so we considered that the pound was around $1.60 and the Euro was around $1.30 and we were considering where our rates were at the time, certainly, when we ran these scenarios.  ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "What I am trying to understand is whether or not you were assuming some sort of mean reversion from a shorter term perspective or whether some of your scenarios actually included the current spot rates.", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", " ", "Yeah, our scenarios did include the current spot rates", "Roger F. Millay - CFO", " ", "And they did include going back a little too.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "So, even some further deterioration?", "Roger F. Millay - CFO", "No, no, the other way.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "OK, so parity or going back to $1.20 in terms of Dollar/Euro was not in the scenario, but moving back ", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "Say a buck 40ish for a dollar Euro or a buck seventy-five, for a dollar pound was included. ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "In summary, we\u2019re not saying that we would still need $1.75 or $1.40, which is what we talked about in September. But we are saying that we consider down to where rates were last week and that they could be in between there or who knows.  ", "It\u2019s hard to predict.", "", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "Also Mark, that\u2019s why we gave it the sensitivity because honestly, we could all take views as to where rates are going but given that you know what our percentage of income, foreign income, and particularly in Europe, the pound piece and the Europe piece, we can all run scenarios off of that. ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "And can you talk a little bit more about what sort of, I guess when we think about this administration change that\u2019s coming, what do you see are going to be some positive in terms of  being helpful to the business and what are going to be some of the potential challenges? ", "", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "I think the headline I would give Mark is that change is usually good for our business, and if I were to look at two areas that I think there will be a lot of change that would be hot areas topics for change within the next year would be health care and executive compensation.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Yep.", "", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "I think there will be a lot of proposals to look at the health care system in the United States, that was certainly one of the big issues in the election, I think the proposals are really all around continuing to use the employer-based system that we have in this country, which I think is good for the kind of consulting we do. So I expect to see a lot of interest from our clients there and executive compensation for obvious reasons will continue to be a hot topic.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "What do you think on the benefit side just in terms of the pure pension side of it, do you think we\u2019re going to see some amelioration of some of the more onerous portions of the PPA? ", "", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "", "Well, I don\u2019t, I think Mark, I\u2019m always hesitant to predict whether we\u2019re gong to see legislative change or not.  I can tell you with certainty though that there are groups that are pushing Congress to consider that, I\u2019ve already seen some letters that people have written asking them to think about some amelioration.", " Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "", "And then can you discuss what you think about what your sense is with regards to your clients specifically on the pension side, how they\u2019re balancing their need for help because markets across almost every asset class have varied more widely than what most people would have generally modeled. And what the implications are there relative to their concerns about needing to not spend as much. Can you discuss that a little bit in terms of the pure pension side?  ", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "Yes, what we\u2019ve seen so far is the recognition that these are big important issues and the most expensive thing they can do is to get them wrong.  So we\u2019ve seen our clients turning to us for the advice and looking to get this right and to get it figured out so I think that\u2019s why we had a pretty good quarter in benefits this last quarter and we\u2019re not really seeing any slowdown in that and we\u2019re projecting a pretty good remainder of the fiscal year for benefits for the same reason. I think some of our retirements fees of course are paid by the trusts anyways but it doesn\u2019t effect the employer\u2019s bottom line but even beyond that I think employers want to get this right.", " ", " Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "", "On the investment consulting type, can you give us a little bit more color with regards to some of the points that you raised during the analysts stay with regards to whether or not the structured products still work and also just the performance fees, what the implications are there or what we\u2019re seeing.   ", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "", "I think, first of all, the structured products still work and in fact, we see demand from our clients from wanting to look at the structured product and do them. We just don\u2019t see as many deals getting done in the market though it\u2019s an issue of not so much appetite but whether those deals can actually get done and one of the things we don\u2019t have a good view on yet is how long these might be deferred for, are these deals that instead of getting done today might get done in three months or six months or are they deals that might get pushed back a year or so may never happen?  And as a result of that, I think we just don\u2019t have a real opinion on that one way or the other. In terms of performance fees, we earned some modest performance fees last year, I think we had not projected that we would have those this year but we would have those not in our original guidance to begin with.", "One thing I should mention is in terms of what portions of our fees are based on assets under management, and that\u2019s below 20% of our investment consulting fees. ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Great.", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "And that was the question I think I got to ask the investor day and I didn\u2019t have the exact number but I think it\u2019s under 20%.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Super. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes on the line from John Fogel, of Sedody and Co. Please proceed.", "John Fogel-  Sedody and Co", "Thank you for taking my call. Good morning. I apologize, I jumped on a little bit late, so if I repeat anything I\u2019m sorry, but I see that headcount ramped up in the investment consulting group and the growth slowed there dramatically from what you put up in 2008, and I was curious, should we expect to see some growth as time goes on?", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "", "Maybe you can clarify after I\u2019m done if I answered the question about acceleration but what we said in the prepared remarks about the growth in investment consulting is that the headcount grew to both satisfied needs from past growth as well as to a position for future growth and that at this point we have taken a pause on that and are evaluating that in light of current conditions and so in terms of the big ramp that you saw over the last year again, we\u2019re going to dictate any future increases based on where we see the market going and opportunities going because again, as you say, our expectations of growth have come down. ", "John Fogel-  Sedody and Co", "Right. Okay, thank you I had missed that. Now how long does it usually take an associate to get fully ranked ? ", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "It probably depends on the level at which they\u2019re coming in and even the line of business that they\u2019re moving into. I think the investment consulting is one that, it for some of our more junior associates, it may be taking 4-6 months before they\u2019re fully ranked.  One of the things we\u2019ve done in the investment just to be clear is we added a lot of capabilities to our research team, particularly in new asset classes. So that\u2019s a good part of what we were doing there, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re getting part of the performance we\u2019d like in the future there. ", "John Fogel-  Sedody and Co", "Okay. Great. And just shifting gears a little bit I believe on your last conference call you mentioned that you didn\u2019t expect to borrow to have to pay out bonuses to pay in Q1, when you look out to fiscal 2020. Given your current cash flow trends, do you still see this as possible?", " John J. Haley - President and CEO", " I think there\u2019s been no change in our view of potential cash needs going out that far. ", "John Fogel-  Sedody and Co", "And I think if we look at the long trends that we see, yes, we would still be on target for that. ", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "But then again, that will be subject to other potential decisions that happen in the meantime, so stay tuned to that as well\u2026.", "John Fogel-  Sedody and Co", "Right, for example if you did some acquisitions or something\u2026", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "We get another share repurchase that would influence that.", "John Fogel-  Sedody and Co", "Right. Actually, that leads into my last question. I was just curious how many shares you bought back in the last quarter and what the average cost was?  ", "", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "What was it?  It was about a million three shares I think \u2026", "Yes. About a million three", "John Fogel-  Sedody and Co", "Do you have an average cost?", "", "John J. Haley - President and CEO", "And the average cost was a bit over $54 dollars. ", "John Fogel-  Sedody and Co", "Ok, great. Thank you very much.

This is Mary Malone, Director of Investor Relations at Watson Wyatt Worldwide. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. I\u2019m here today with John Haley, Watson Wyatt\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer.

", "At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thank you, Mary. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to share the results of our fiscal year \u201909 second quarter with you. Our reported revenues for the quarter were $436 million a decline of 2% over prior year reported revenues. However, on a constant currency basis, our revenues increased 6% over prior year. ", "In spite of the economic slow down we achieved constant currency revenue growth in each of our segments during the quarter; 7% in benefits, 12% in technology and administration solutions, 1% in the human capital group, 28% in insurance and financial services and 5% in investment consulting. Current economic conditions have increased demand for some of our segments and hindered others, but overall we\u2019re pleased with our results and resilience. ", "For the quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.93. This is a 13% increase over the prior period of $0.82 per share. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in an 8% reduction through our EPS. On the constant currency basis, diluted earnings were $1.01 or a 23% increase over prior year. The growth in our EPS is due to decreases in our income tax rate and shares outstanding as well as to the increases in both operating and non-operating income.", "While we would prefer to work in a good economy, we are well positioned to weather this economic down turn. Our services are well aligned with changing market demands. We have contingency plans in place to pro-actively manage our costs in areas where demand may slow. We are a conservatively managed company with excellent cash flow and a strong balance sheet. For the third consecutive year Forbes magazine named Watson Wyatt one of the Americas 400 best big companies. ", "Now let\u2019s review each of our segments beginning with benefits. For the quarter, Benefits Group revenues were $240 million, a decrease of 2% from prior year, but an increase of 7% on a constant currency basis. We experienced increased demand for our services across all geographic regions. Growth was two points higher after adjusting for the spin off of the Multi-Employer Retirement business in North America in February 2008.", "The economic turmoil created additional demand for us, as we advice pension plans sponsors on their funding requirements. Funding is largely influenced by law. In Europe, many plan sponsors are focused on the solvency of their pension plans and in some countries any statutory ramification from changes in funded status. ", "In the U.S. the pension protection act is taking effect at one of the worst possible times. Companies are transitioning to new more restrictive funding requirements while declining pension asset values and the weakened economy. While it is expected that the PPA will lead to more predictable funding, planned sponsors have not had time to build up surplus cushions to soften the extremely volatile and negative market conditions over the last four months. ", "The recovery act that was signed into law on December 23 will provide some measure of relief, but the recovery acts effect on funded status will be slight and offers no relief from benefit restrictions. We think to find benefit plan sponsors will still struggle to meet the large and unexpected contributions required in the next two years. ", "There are two other relief proposals that have been put before congress. These other proposals combined with the recovery act would generate more significant improvement in plan funded status and reduction in required contributions. We expect significant dialogue with our clients on these issues.", " ", "Now, let\u2019s move to the Technology and Administration Solutions Group. For the quarter revenues were $51 million, up 3% from prior year and 12% on a constant currency basis. We performed better-than-expected in North America, primarily due to additional project work with existing clients. ", "On a pre-deferral basis, constant currency revenue was 6%. As this practice matures in North America and we have more clients in on-going service delivery, our base of recurring revenue increases. When projects move from implementation into on-going service delivery, we begin recognizing revenues and this provides growth over the prior period.", " ", "We also achieved growth this quarter from additional project work at existing clients as compared to prior year; we had more work at existing clients and less project implementation work. Some other project work is due to corporate actions resulting from the economic downturn. This change in the mix of work drove our high growth rate. ", "We continue to have an excellent retention rate. However, we expect project work will probably decline as companies continue to face economic pressure and cancel or delay discretionary projects. The on-going administration work is considered a critical business activity.", "Our administration revenues are largely based on participant levels and an increase in unemployment could have a negative effect on those revenues. However, in North America, we think our revenues will be impacted more by discretionary project levels than by changes in unemployment rates. ", "We are also performing well in Europe and have an excellent retention rate there too. Virtually, all of our revenues in Europe are from on-going administration work. We have a stable platform of revenues in this segment and we have some visibility into our growth. We expect that revenues will continue to grow for the remainder of the fiscal year, but they will probably grow at a more moderate rate. ", "Due to the economic climate, fewer companies may change their technology platforms and this could have a negative affect on our ability to win new clients. Although our growth may slow the administration services that we provide or a compelling proposition for companies looking to control cost, improve employee engagement and productivity and free-up the HR function for more strategic efforts. ", "Next, let me turn to the Human Capital Group. For the quarter, revenues were $51 million, down 4% from prior year, but up 1% on a constant currency basis. This segment performed well on our first fiscal quarter, but in the middle of the second quarter, we started to see a slow down. We are focused on containing cost within this practice in maintaining profitability. Demand for compensation services was lower than expected and we think this is directly related to the economic times. ", "We expect our fiscal third quarter will be seasonally stronger for this practice due to the compliance nature of some of the work performed. However, we\u2019re bringing down our expectations for this segment for fiscal year 2009. As the new administration takes off, these companies are preparing for what is anticipated to be a lively congressional debate on executive compensation. While many new ideas are certain to emerge between now and then, we\u2019ve seen a number of proposals, some of which have become part of the bank bailout legislation. ", "In addition, shareholder activists have seen some success in winning approval for say on pay mandates. There may also be some project work as companies in bankruptcy restructured the compensation program. We still expect to have constant currency revenue growth through the fiscal year, but it will be lower than initially expected.", "Now I\u2019ll discuss the insurance in Financial Services Group. For the quarter, revenues were $34 million, up 14% from prior year and 28% on a constant currency basis. Insurers and financial services companies have been hit hard by the crisis and we\u2019re working closely with these clients to help them through the turmoil. We\u2019ve seen an increase in merger and acquisition activity as some financial services groups look to raise capital to help them through these difficult times. ", "We have also seen some fall off in demand as companies defer work or take projects in-house. So far client needs created by the crisis have more than offset project cancellations or deferrals and we expect this to continue in the short term. We also had one very large project this quarter that contributed to the significant increase in our revenues. We think the client needs created by the crisis will more than offset any project cancellations or deferrals. As of now, we expect to have good growth for the remainder of this fiscal year. ", "Lastly, Investment Consulting reported revenues of $37 million for the quarter, a decrease of 12% from prior year, but an increase of 5% on a constant currency basis. The financial crisis is affecting our business in two ways. First, in our ability to execute transactions on behalf of our clients, particularly hedging transactions and second in the advice we give to clients. ", "We\u2019re still urging clients to exercise caution in changing managers and to defer making certain types of investments, while the long term effects of this global crisis will take some time to manifest we are thinking ahead of that winning strategies that will add value in an increasingly unpredictable and competitive marketplace. Many funds are looking at their investment strategy and risk powers. The proposal pipeline is as strong as we have ever seen in North America, but the sales process is taking longer. ", "In Europe we also have a very strong pipeline with significant interest in our Advanced Investment Solution service. We continue to be optimistic about the longer term growth prospects for this segment but growth will be more moderate for this fiscal year. ", "Wrapping up, we continue to stay as close as possible to our clients. In fact, we hosted more than 200 of our clients at our 11th annual client conference in early November. ", "We will continue to partner with our clients to find practical solutions for today\u2019s business challenges. We are cautiously optimistic about our overall performance for the remainder of this fiscal year. While we will continue to face challenges and some of our segments will perform better than others we expect to achieve constant currency revenue and EPS growth.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger.", "", "Roger Millay ", "Thanks, John and good morning to everyone. As you\u2019ve just heard we experienced good growth in our second fiscal quarter. For the quarter we reported revenues of $436 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.93. On a constant currency basis total revenues were $475 million resulting in 6% growth over the prior year. On a constant currency basis our diluted EPS was a $1.1 an increase of 23% over prior year. ", "The Benefits Group had a 30% margin for the quarter, an increase from 26% last year. The margin improvement over prior year was driven by North America. We\u2019re still expecting full year margins consistent with prior year in the high 20% range. \u00a0", "Technology and Administration Solutions had a 28% margin for the quarter, a decrease from 33% last year. Margins decreased in both Europe and North America. In Europe the margin decline is due to increased installation activity during the quarter, which is generally lower margin work. ", "In North America, the prior year\u2019s second quarter margin was unusually high due to client work around the implementation of the Pension Protection Act. We still expect margins for the year to be in the mid 20% range. ", "Human Capital Group had a 20% margin for the quarter, a decrease from 23% last year. Margins were down in both North America and Europe. We are taking steps to contain our costs as we anticipate continued revenue slowdown in this segment. Our margins for the year will probably be in the mid-teens. ", "Insurance and Financial Services had a 29% margin for the quarter, a significant increase from the -1% last year. The margin improvement reflects the increase in revenues, as well as the reduction in the expenses from the rightsizing of our cost structure last fiscal year. We are increasing our forecast for this segment and expect margins will be in the mid-teens for the year. ", "Investment Consulting had a 22% margin for the quarter, a decrease from 35% last year. Margins were down in all regions as compared to prior year. As we mentioned last quarter we\u2019ve added to the team this year to support our past growth and to position ourselves for our future growth. We\u2019ve slowed our hiring as we await greater visibility to market developments. ", "We\u2019re working in a tough environment but remain confident in our franchise. We have the research capabilities and the client support teams required to maintain our market leadership position. We still expect our margins for fiscal 2009, to be in the high 20% range. In fiscal 2009, our cost increased to include the talent and skills needed for the long term, but our revenues incorporate the negative impact of continued market turmoil for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "We continue to think the long-term prospects are good for this practice. The segment margins that we\u2019ve just reviewed before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles resulting from our acquisitions. ", "For the quarter, our operating income margin was 12.8% an improvement over the last quarter but a decline from 13.4% in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $40 million, up from $37 million in the prior year. Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.93 as compared to prior year first quarter earnings per share of $0.82. On a constant currency basis, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.01.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $74 million of cash and $61 million of debt. We expect to have debt repaid by the end of the fiscal year. We generated $77 million in cash flows from operating activities this quarter and we\u2019ll continue to generate strong cash flows this fiscal year. Our liquidity position is also very strong. We have an additional $239 million available under our line of credit that we don\u2019t expect to need. ", "Now, let\u2019s review our guidance for fiscal 2009. The slides posted in our website will be following along in this session. The revenues and diluted earnings per share that we report will continue to be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. ", "We\u2019re keeping our full year EPS guidance at $3.50 to $3.57. A positive effect of our business performing better than forecast as offset the negative effect of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This guidance includes up to $0.35 of foreign currency translation losses from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We\u2019re bringing down our revenue guidance and we expect to report revenues in the range of $1.67 billion to $1.72 billion. ", "We don\u2019t know exchange rate will fluctuate over the remainder of our fiscal year. This guidance anticipates that over the next six months, the pound Sterling maintains a minimum average value of approximately $1.30 and the euro maintains a minimum of average value of approximately $1.20. ", "Generally speaking, a little less than half of our business is in Europe and a 10% drop in the pound and the euro will result in a little more than 5% drop in our EPS over the remainder of the fiscal year. The U.K is about three quarters of our European business, so changes in the pound affect our results more than changes in the Euro. ", "Seasonally more of our European income is earned in the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to be cautiously optimistic of our fiscal \u201909. We\u2019re beginning to see signs of slow down in certain parts of our business where other parts of our business are doing well. This guidance assumes an income tax rate of 32% to 33% for the year and shares outstanding of approximately 42.8 million for the year. ", "Now I\u2019ll pass through the revenue guidance for each of the segments. Please note that the slides in our website show both reported and constant currency revenue guidance. Since constant currency is better measure of underlying business performance, I\u2019ll focus my remarks on the constant currency guidance. ", "Let\u2019s start with Benefits. Our Benefits constant currency revenue guidance is 4%to 6% growth in fiscal year 2009. Normalizing benefits for the multi-employer business that we exited in fiscal \u201908 revenue growth would be 5% to 7%. ", "In the Technology and Administration Solutions Group we\u2019re increasing our constant currency revenue guidance to 9% to 12% growth in fiscal \u201909. The increase reflects the mix of work in our pipeline in North America and the progress of our new client in Europe. ", "We\u2019ve stopped providing the project numbers in North America because these numbers have become much less useful in understanding or projecting financial results. The project numbers recited were just a subset of our North America works and have become an increasingly small part of the North America business. ", "In the Human Capital Group, we\u2019re reducing our constant currency revenue guidance to 2% to 5% in fiscal \u201809 based on the slow down we\u2019re seeing. In Insurance and Financial Services we are increasing our constant currency revenue guidance to 10% to 15% for fiscal 2009, as we expect the turmoil and the financial services sector to create work for us in the near term. This segment has the widest range because we have less visibility into the magnitude and timing of the potential projects. ", "Lastly, we are revising our constant currency investment consulting revenue growth down to 6% to 9% in fiscal 2009. This down will revision to our guidance assumes that market conditions continue to be difficult for the\u00a0remainder of the fiscal year. These are difficult economic times for everyone. Despite this environment we continue to expect to achieve constant currency revenue growth in each of our segments. ", "We expect reported third quarter revenues will be in the range of $420 million to $430 million and reported diluted EPS will be in the range of $0.88 to $0.92 cents. Third quarter diluted EPS may include up to $0.15 of foreign currency translation losses due to the strengthening of the US dollar. Third quarter revenue guidance by segment is presented on slide four. ", "In summary, we continue to believe that we will deliver good earnings and cash flow results for the year in the local markets of our business across the world. However, the resilience of our underlying business is somewhat massed in our reported results by the changes in foreign exchange rates.", "", "John Haley", "Thanks Roger. Now we\u2019ll take any questions that you may have.\u00a0", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar - City Group. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - City Group", "So I heavily appreciate the clarity of the press release separating out the impact of currency from the factor that you can actually control. My first question is, as it relates to maintaining your forward outlook, clearly the December quarter, performance is a part of that, but what kind of proactive steps are you taking to run in your cost structure? And is there any way you can separate out a variable comp accruals from other steps you\u2019re taking?", "John Haley", "Well, do you want to talk about the cost and I\u2019ll handle the variable. ", "Roger Millay", "Yes sure. Ashwin, I think if you look at the business again our emphasis is on the balance between what we\u2019re seeing in the revenue line and just to reemphasize we are seeing constant currency growth in all the segments, but really maintaining focus on those segments like Human Capital that are seeing some pressures. ", "So we haven\u2019t taken kind of broad systemic cost actions at this point. Its been targeted to those practices and those regions of the world where the pressure is and at this point, that\u2019s the continuing plan for the year, but we\u2019re prepared to respond with contingency plans as we see the environment change.", "John Haley", "Yes and just to follow up on that, salary and employ benefits are our biggest expense, but there is a lot of other cost management activities that we can\u2019t pursue. Some of the easier ones really relate to discretionary costs such as non-essential travel, certain internal meetings. We\u2019ve been very aggressive in going after those costs. ", "As you know as well as I\u2019ve stated in the past, I don\u2019t generally like the idea of the lay-offs during temporary declines in demand, their cost associated with the lay-offs then their additional cost associated with ramping back up, lay-offs are very bad for morale. So they are not something that we look at as our first or maybe then our second resource. Now these are unusual times and if there are some significant slowdowns in our business we would have to consider all alternatives, but as of now we don\u2019t have any significant work force reduction plans. ", "Let me turn to the variable comp. The way we look at the variable comp is that there is really a partnership between our shareholders and our associate and as times get better they should both share in that and as times are more difficult they should both share in the downside and we try to keep that then relatively constant. ", "So we grow the earnings per share by the same percentage as we grow the variable comp and we\u2019ve been following that model for some number of years now and while we can always review that and look at one way or other. We again follow that this quarter.\u00a0", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets", "Okay.\u00a0Can you comment on the cash flow outlook, commentary on debt\u00a0pay and seem to indicate the potentially lower cash expectation than before?", "John Haley", "Yes, I think in the guidance I believe that we gave before was $195 million cash balance at the end of the year and I think now we\u2019re looking at some thing more or like 160 to 170. Apart of that difference probably the biggest, the most significant part of that difference being additional pension contributions, which we\u2019re working on now and then also, of course, currency does affect some of the foreign current log at this point all the foreign currency cash balances or there is an impact of effects as well.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets", "Okay and my last question. As I look at the next two quarters, can you remind us of any one time impact that affected the prior year that we should be aware of?", "", "Roger Millay", "No. Ashwin, as you know, of course, every quarter has its own unique features, but there is nothing really big, I don\u2019t think last year that we can think of.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Fones - UBS. ", "", "Andrew Fones \u2013 UBS", "Yes. Thank you. First, I need to ask on the Insurance and Financial Services business. If you could kind of give us a quantification, perhaps of this one off project and how that might impact the third and fourth quarters, if at all? Thanks.", "", "John Haley", "Sure. I think this was a big project and basically, the way to think about it is, it really provided all of our growth for the quarter. Now, that this project has ended, but we expect that there are going to some others like that. The credit crisis and the falling asset prices have really resulted in an increase in M&A activity. ", "As financial services companies look to strengthen their balance sheet and we\u2019ve been active with this increase in activity, we\u2019ve consulted on both buy-side and sell-side situations. So, when I say that we expect to see some projects do that we have pretty visibility into the third quarter projects, but, we also expect to see a little in the fourth quarter, but we are little less clear about that activity.", "", "Andrew Fones \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thanks and on the Human Capital Group, I think you\u2019ve said in the past about 65% of the revenues come from compensation services and you, expect that to kind of hold a factor in a weak economic environment. Can you talk about the seasonality of that work and how that impacts, some of the weakness we\u2019re seeing now, but the potential strength you might see in the fourth quarter? Thanks. ", "John Haley", "So let me talk about that I think first of all well, let me confirm that the 65% per compensation is correct about 26% of our revenues are for data services at about 9% for our organizational effectiveness. The slow down we\u2019ve seen so far has primarily been in compensation and particularly in sales force compensation consulting. ", "We\u2019ve also seen some slowing in strategic rewards which is our broad base compensation consulting program and an executive comp. Executive comp is the one holding up the best so far and we still think we\u2019re going to see a lot of activity on that further remainder of the fiscal year. We are still doing some work in organizational effectiveness but we do expect that\u2019s going to be down year-over-year. ", "Our Data Services is the area that we expect to be the most resilient in the FCG area. We\u2019re one of only a few providers of data in a broad range of countries and therefore we are well positioned even if companies cut back on the number of suppliers used for data. ", "Andrew Fones- UBS", "Thanks and in terms that 65% what proportion of that roughly is the executive comp versus sales force in strategic reward.", "", "Roger Millay ", "I would guess that it\u2019s in the area of around two thirds.", "", "Andrew Fones- UBS", "Okay. Thank you and then just finally on technology solutions you mentioned that you are benefiting there in similar force changes and there project works that\u2019s great. Do you have any senses to tell what should be the growth is been driven by that or, you know what proportion of revenue that would it.", "", "Roger Millay ", "It was one of the real drivers of growth for the quarter certainly and although new implementations of long term contracts was also a significant contributor. I don\u2019t have a number for you but certainly we think the leading contributor to the existing new projects at existing clients was driven by the restructuring type activities within those clients and you know I think there would be some hope that would continue obviously that\u2019s unpredictable though given that it\u2019s dependent on what\u2019s happening within our clients businesses.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche. ", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. Just wondering you\u2019ve been in the fourth quarter the full impact on demand of the decline in the market was felt in that in the pick up or in a demand for pension consulting or do you think there is more to come relative to the fourth quarter in the next couple of quarters. Thanks.", "", "John Haley", "So you are talking about our second fiscal quarter.", "", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Yes.", "", "John Haley", "Yes. We\u2019ve done a lot of work in the retirement field there in the second quarter and we expect we\u2019re going to continue to do a lot of work into the third quarter. Maybe a little less than that in the fourth quarter but, one of the features of the current environment is that we see a lot of activity particularly, in North America in our retirement consulting.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Marcon - R.W. Baird.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Good morning and congratulations on the strong results. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit John on how you think, the friendship consulting portion of the Benefit\u2019s practice is going to continue to unfold. On one hand, it sounds like there is obviously a lot of stress in terms of asset evaluations, as well as changes in regulation on the flip side. It is becoming more cumbersome for some companies to fund these initiatives and so how do you think it\u2019s going to unfold for the balance of this year relative to what you\u2019ve seen thus far and then how do you think about it from a longer term perspective?", "", "John Haley", "So, I think Mark, I guess in talking about any of this, I should start by saying this is probably the most difficult time in my experience to give any predictions, even a quarter or so in advance. ", "When I think about the pension consulting, its during the height of the storm that we actually see the biggest increase in some of the pension consulting because, its when you have all of these incredible strains on the funding, on the benefit restrictions because of the under-funding on the volatility of the contributions, that\u2019s when plan sponsors are consulting with us quite a bit on what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s when the storm has passed it\u2019s may be when there is not quite as much going on.", "So I actually expect that for our third fiscal quarter, we expect to still see a lot of activity in the retirement area, particularly, in North America and we expect to see continued activity into the fourth quarter. I think its 2010, that we might see it slowing down a little bit more. Thinking about this long term, I do think that most of the people that still have defined benefit plan seem to be pretty much committed to them and we haven\u2019t seen any big changes like additional freezing\u2019s of plans or anything like that. Even if that occurs, we still get a lot of worked out.", "So I think we don\u2019t see this as fast a growth factor as some of our other areas, but we do see this as a solid performing business for a long time.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Can you talk a little bit about the amendment to the PPA that was passed on December 23? I mean, it doesn\u2019t seem like that could have had any impact at all in the fiscal second quarter, but it should have a positive impact in the\u2026. ", "", "John Haley", "Sure. Let me mention two things and really that was December 23. So that\u2019s not going to show up in the second quarter. So the Recovery Act permits 24 month as its moving, but the smooth asset value has to fall within 90% and 100% of fair market value. So what happens is, the smooth asset value is probably going to be more than 110. So everybody is going to decline under 110. ", "We have to consult around what the impact of that would be, but one of the things we think is that it\u2019s only going to provide limit relief to the validity of the contribution. There is a couple of other proposals out there, one is to get rid of the 110 or at least change it in some fashion. The other is to allow plans to more of a free election of evaluation methods. We are talking with client sponsors about those if we see those pass we could see additional consulting assignments.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Can you talk about the magnitude of those sorts of consulting assignments relative to what you\u2019ve already done? Because you have a confluence of two factors, you have the assets other than U.S treasuries and Japanese governments have obviously contracted materially. So that\u2019s one aspect and then there is these changes to the PPA and I was just wondering if there is any way to potentially spice the impact and then and most of the discussions also focused on North America, but obviously the asset destructions is global. So if you could talk a little bit about the international impacts as well that would be great.", "", "John Haley", "Sure. So two things first of all and as you know, we don\u2019t really keep track. There is no way for us to look at what part of any special projects we might do or our current market conditions or pension funding, we don\u2019t really have that data, but we looked at it and we think, \u201cokay, how much of the revenue in the second quarter, how much of the increase was from that?\u201d and we think basically about a point or two about the global growth probably came from these types of projects. So one way I\u2019m thinking about what could it do in the third quarter would be to say if we would expect another point or two of global growth in retirement to come from that.", "Roger Millay", "I think one of the reasons that we are focusing on North America, everywhere around the world where there are defined Benefit plans; people are being hit with the decline in asset values with the necessity of increased fundings. North America or the U.S. in particular is a little different because not only is it the decline in asset values, but it\u2019s also new funding regulation hitting at the same time. So, that\u2019s really why we\u2019ve done that because there is probably some increased consulting as a result to that.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "And that\u2019s why I was trying to get at this, but in particular, the impact of the change that\u2019s coming because that hasn\u2019t slowed through as you said. So, I mean, how much do you think this amendment is going end up adding?", "", "John Haley", "I guess Mark, now when you look at our guidance that we gave for the rest of the year, we took that all into account. Okay", "", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "A point or two?", "", "John Haley", "Yes. I mean, I think the point or two is probably right, but I don\u2019t think there is anything over what we have in our guidance.\u00a0I\u2019d guess what I should say is our guidance is based on about the same kind of activity. If we see more because there is some new proposals come out or some thing that could provide some up-sight, but we have already factored in sort of the current situation.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. The reason why I\u2019m asking is because it looks like you didn\u2019t definitely change your full year outlook on the benefit side on a CC basis and you wouldn\u2019t have had the change, the amendment in your guidance previously and that\u2019s so I guess, that\u2019s why I went asking.", "", "Roger Millay ", "Yes. I mean to your point we are running at the high-end of the guidance that we\u2019ve given. So you might interpret that relative to the range that there might be some upside there, but I think again, John\u2019s 1% to 2% probably the numbers that we\u2019re looking at and it\u2019s incorporated in the guidance.", "", "John Haley", "But I think Roger really has that right. We are running at the high side of the guidance and could we have taken the guidance up, as long as we are\u00a0in the corner there, we didn\u2019t. ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Great and then, can you talk a little bit more about Technology Solutions and just the areas where you saw some improvement be of all of the various changes that are occurring in another words. What were the other scope projects for the already installed based that you ended up putting in place?", "", "Roger Millay", "I think the one think that\u2019s may be get a little different this quarter from what the companies talked about that in the past is that as we\u2019ve add client activity as they have restructured their business either related to their underline segments or related to their underline employee population or relative to their plans, because of pressures that they have, there are benefit changes in their plans that have to be incorporated into the underlying systems that we provide to them. So that\u2019s just generated work and so it is kind of change order type work related to those activities with their clients and that was the major driver.", "", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Can you scope how much of the upside was due to that..?", "", "Roger Millay", "Well, I mean I think again I don\u2019t have a dollar number for that quite. You know I think it was low double digit growth and the change order piece of that was substantial portion. I would say probably some where around half of that and so that gives you some sense of that magnitude.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus.

When we get to the end of the year, we have a distribution message which distributes bonuses and it\u2019s based essentially 25% on how the company as a whole did 25% on how the particular geographic region did and 50% on how the regional practice did and that gives us sort of pools for people use and then we looked o the practices within each of the regions to distribute the bonus to individuals. ", "So when IFS has a good year that increases the regional practice component significantly whoever did that, but it also increases the regional component of the rest of the geographic region they are in and it increases the overall company component for everybody. Similarly, associates in IFS gain when Benefits has good year.", "Mark Marcon- Robert W. Baird & Co", "Okay, great and then, just in terms of the size and scope, you have this other IFS project it\u2019s coming on, but it sounds like you have others in the pipeline as well. Would you expect that the one that you just did would be the largest of any of them or could some of the other ones be just as big?", "", "John Haley", "We expect when we just state it would be largest.", "", "Mark Marcon- Robert W. Baird & Co", "Okay and nothing even on a cumulative basis the other ones wouldn\u2019t from that to its size.", "", "John Haley", "Yes, I mean, we have and so the visibility we have is that we see a project that we are working on right now in the third quarter, that is not by a good bit, as the one we just finished in the second quarter and then we look at a market which we think could generate some more of these and it\u2019s hard for us to say about how cumulatively the others could affect it, but we can tell you of the first two, the first one was much bigger than the second. ", "", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co", "And the first one didn\u2019t run over until this quarter?", "", "Roger Millay ", "Not really now.", "", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co", "And then, can you just this is a qualitative question that obviously as the quarter unfolded the severity of the downturn intensified and I\u2019m just wondering if qualitatively if you can talk a little about, how your clients were reacting broad scope as they saw things intensifying and going into January and then, in terms of what sort of feed back are you getting from your various practice managers?", "", "John Haley", "Yes, I mean, I guess that the problem is that there is no way to give sort of what is a aggregate client reaction, because it depends so much on the specific practices.", "", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co", "So, certainly this was a positive, in certain areas it\u2019s a negative right?", "", "John Haley", "Yes, exactly right and so I think if you go back to the sort of commentary that we gave on each of the individual practices that probably gives you a sense of what the reactions are from clients, but I think that it\u2019s just varies significantly. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Fones - UBS. ", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Yes. Thank you. I just had a question on expenses; the professional and subcontracted services, even I think just in for currency was down year-over-year. I realize it\u2019s a long pay. If there is anything trails there and perhaps if you could we should think about whether a lot of those services are used by anyone of your particular businesses and nice trend with that going forward and then the second question was on the occupancy and communications, you did a good job of keeping cost stand there too and whether we should expect that continue to remain relatively allowing them to year-over-year consequence growth. Thanks.", "", "John Haley", "It sounds like a question for Roger.", "", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "It sounds like a question for later may be. ", "", "Roger Millay ", "Yes. Certainly, currency I don\u2019t have anything in my fingertips that can do a variance analysis for you there. Certainly currency is one of the impactors and makes it difficult to compare the financial statements. I will say broadly that as John indicated earlier, we started I would say, at least early in the quarter strong focus on the costs every where and so I think you\u2019ll see currency aside you will see in the occupancy and other line. ", "On going discipline in that area and certainly in occupancy and I think its commercial real estate markets continues to soften and leases role over will be all the drive we think more favorable leases. So I think you see continued discipline and other than that I don\u2019t think I have any specific comments, but we can take a look at and follow up with you if you like.", "", "Operator", "Mr. Haley, there is no additional questions at this time.", "", "John Haley", "Okay. Well, again thanks to every one for joining us and we look forward to reviewing our third quarter results with you in May.

My name Lis, and I'll be your coordinator for today.", "At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be conducting a question-and-answer session at the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions).", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Mary Malone. Please proceed ma'am.", "Mary Malone", "Thank you. Good morning. This is Mary Malone, Director of Investor Relations at Watson Wyatt Worldwide. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.", "I'm here today with John Haley, Watson Wyatt's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to our website for this morning's press release.", "Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay via telephone for the next week by dialing 617-801-6888, confirmation number 13854491.

You may get back in the queue if you have additional questions.", "Now I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John J. Haley", "Thank you, Mary. Good Morning and thank you for joining us today.", "As you know, these are tough times and while we achieve constant currency revenue growth and solid profitability, the third quarter of fiscal '09 was more challenging than we forecasted.", "Our reported revenues for the quarter were $470 million, a decline of 9% over prior year reported revenues, but an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. We achieved constant currency revenue growth in all of our segments except for the Human Capital Group and other, which is comprised of some smaller practice areas.", "The declines in the Human Capital Group and other category were significant and therefore our revenue is below our revenue is below our guidance and our own expectations. In benefits, technology and administration solutions and investment consulting, a revenue growth was consistent with our guidance. Insurance and financial services performed better than we had expected.", "On a constant currency basis, revenue growth during the quarter was as follows. 3%, in benefits, 13% in technology and administration solutions, 23% in insurance and financial services and 12% in investment consulting. On a constant currency basis, the Human Capital Group declined 18% and the other category declined 27%.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.95, or $0.01 decline from the prior period $0.96 per share. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in a 14% reduction to our EPS. On a constant currency basis, diluted earnings per share were $1.09 or 14% increase over the prior year. Our EPS this quarter includes $0.03 of severance. We have selectively reduced headcount in areas, where demand has declined significantly.", "We generally experienced good financial performance in areas, where we have a low established market position, mature relationships and annuity driven business. We didn't perform as well in the areas, where we have smaller base or expanding geographically or relying on more discretionary projects.", "Our clients are facing tough times in making difficult decisions. In that context, the initiatives that are compliance driven oriented reducing costs and risk have higher priorities. We continue to work with our clients to find practical solutions for these challenges.", "Now let's review the segments. For the quarter, Benefits Group revenues were $248 million, a decrease of 7% from prior year, but an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see good demand for our retirement services in the U.S. and the U.K. Those demand for our retirement services in Continental Europe and for healthcare consulting was lower than expected.", "In our third fiscal quarter, we tend to do a lot of the accounting and financial reporting compliance work. We have good growth in the U.S., but the rate of growth was lower than prior quarters. We have strong growth in the UK and in Latin America.", "In the UK, we have two additional work base due to the timing of the public holidays around Easter, which fell in our fourth fiscal quarter last year. Our revenues declined in Asia Pacific and Continental Europe. Our core retirement services grew at a greater rate in the overall segment. Healthcare consulting services declined.", "While it is difficult to predict future results in these uncertain times, we expect that our core retirement services will continue to do well in the U.S. and the UK. We have modest expectations for healthcare consulting and countries, where we have a smaller footprint. Plan sponsors around the world continue to seek advice on pension funding goals and plan design opportunities. We expect to continue to work with our clients on these issues.", "Now let's move on to the Technology and Administration Solutions Group. For the quarter, revenues were $44 million, down 1% from prior year, but up 13% on a constant currency basis. On a pre-deferral basis, constant currency revenue growth was 12%.", "Constant currency growth was highest in the UK as the big client wins that we announced in the third quarter of fiscal '08 have all gone live. We've been busy working on the new client installations as well as our commitments to existing clients. We've had less new client wins in fiscal '09 as we temporarily shifted focus to implementing our fiscal '08 wins.", "Similar to Europe, the U.S. growth was driven by bringing online additional projects, which has been sold in previous quarters. The growth rate in the U.S. has slowed as companies have deferred discretionary spending. Despite that, we continue to see opportunities as our value preposition of helping companies across a wide spectrum of administrative solutions remains well received.", "We continue to have excellent client retention rates and a stable platform of revenues globally in this segment. We also have some visibility into the next quarter's results. We expect a lower constant currency growth rate as new and new clients to go live and less discretionary project work commencing at this time.", "Although, we expect our growth to slow inline with the market generally, the administration services that we provide are of compelling preposition for companies looking to control costs and we expect to gain market share. Proposal activity has picked up and we're hopeful that the slowdown in growth will be temporary.", "Next, let me turn to the Human Capital Group. For the quarter, revenues were $37 million, down 25% from prior year and down 18% on a constant currency basis. The slowdown in work in this segment is much greater than we had forecasted. All regions and all service lines underperformed. The month of March was particularly poor.", "In compensation, revenues declined significantly in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. We saw modest increases in revenue in Canada, the UK, Europe and Latin America. We generally found the clients are interested in the thought leadership of our most senior associates, but the project work that typically utilized their less senior associates has substantially declined.", "Data services proved less resilient than we had expected. Revenues declined in all regions. Organization affected this as a small part of the Human Capital Group and its revenue declined as expected. As these projects are typically small, short-term and non-recurring, they are the most discretionary of our service offerings.", "Within the Human Capital Group, we are focusing on the areas, where we have the critical mass and brand to compete. We are taking the actions necessary to reshape the practice and make it more profitable for the longer-term. Now, I'll discuss the Insurance and Financial Services group.", "For the quarter, revenues were $31 million, up 2% from prior year and 23% on a constant currency basis. Our third fiscal quarter was a seasonally strong quarter for this practice, because this is when we do annual valuation work for many clients. All regions performed well this quarter and the team was busy doing a combination of financial management work and special project work.", "The merger and acquisition activity continued. We have several small projects this quarter in contrast to the one very large project that we had in the second fiscal quarter. Insurers and financial services companies continue to review their capital requirements and there has been some additional project activity as companies look to raise capital in these difficult times.", "We have also seen some fall off in demand as company's deferred workers take projects in house. In the near-term, we think the projects were created by the difficult times will more than offset any project cancellations, but the level activity is difficult to predict. And we expect a slowdown in the rate of constant currency growth.", "Lastly, investment consulting reported revenues of $39 million for the quarter, a decrease of 10% from the prior year, but an increase of 12% on the constant currency basis. We had good growth in the UK, Europe, and North America.", "We have seen an increase in our implemented consulting activities due impart to several expanded client relationships. We're also seeing an increase in strategy projects. We are still urging clients to exercise caution in changing managers. While long-term effects of this global crisis will take some time to manifest, we are thinking ahead about winning strategies that will add value in an increasingly unpredictable and competitive marketplace. Many funds are looking at their investments strategy and risk tolerance. We continue to be optimistic about the longer term growth prospects for the segment.", "Wrapping up in areas, where we have low established market positions, we generally performed well. In these difficult economic times, it is very challenging to establish new market position. We are committed to running sensible businesses within our segments and we will only make investments, where the future prospects were. We are also focused on reducing our cost structure and preserving our operating margins. We will continue to stay to close to our clients to help them respond effectively to the economic crisis.", "Now I'll turn the cal over to Roger.", "Roger F. Millay", "Thanks John, and good morning to everyone.", "As you've just heard, we generally performed well, but we really face significant challenges in the Human Capital Group and the other category, which is comprised of some smaller practice areas.", "For the quarter, we reported revenues of $417 million and diluted EPS of $0.95. On a constant currency basis, total revenues were $471 million, resulting in 3% growth of over prior year. And also on a constant currency basis, our diluted EPS was $1.09, an increase of 14% over prior year. For the quarter, our operating income margin was 12.4%, a decline from 14.1% in the prior year quarter. Excluding severance costs, our operating margin was 12.8% for the quarter.", "As John noted, several of our practices continued to perform quite well, but we do have profitability pressure in our more cyclical areas, particularly Human Capital. We've had lay-offs in our under performing areas and we will also reduce headcounts through natural attrition and retirements. We will continue to face challenges and some of our segments will perform better than others. The Benefits Group had a 33% margin for the quarter, consistent with prior year.", "The third fiscal quarter tends to be our seasonally strongest quarter with the highest margins. We're still expecting full year margins consistent with prior year at around 30%. Technology and Administration Solutions had a 20% margin for the quarter, a decline from 22% in prior year. We still expect margins for the year to be in the mid 20% range.", "Human Capital Group had a loss of $600,000 for the quarter, a significant decline from last year. The loss includes approximately $500,000 of severance. North America generated positive income, but all other regions operated at a loss. As John mentioned, the economic climate has resulted in a tighter, more competitive market.", "We are closely monitoring our loss generating offices and are downsizing underperforming locations. Our longer-term strategy is to focus on those markets, where there is enough demand to support an office and there is affordable talent. We expect to have additional severance costs in the fourth quarter and therefore, our margins in HCG for the year will probably be in the mid to high single-digits.", "While we expect to have another very tough quarter, we are committed to taking the actions necessary to have a more profitable and competitive Human Capital group for the longer-term. As John said, we are focused on markets where we have the critical mass and brand to compete. Insurance and financial services had a 29% margin for the quarter, a significant increase from last year. All regions generated more income this quarter with the most significant increases coming from Europe and North America.", "The margin improvement reflects the increase in revenues as well as the reduction of expenses from rationalizing our cost structure last fiscal year. We're increasing our forecast for this segment and expect margins will be in the high teens for the year.", "Investment Consulting had a 27% margin for the quarter, a decrease from 37% last year. Margins were down at all regions as compared to prior year. We think the long-term sustainable margin for this segment is in the low 30% range. Even though this is continued to be challenging economic times with volatile markets, we've seen an increase in demand and expect our margin will continue to increase. The segment margins that we've just reviewed are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other un-allocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles resulting from our acquisitions.", "Net income for the quarter was $41 million, a decline from $43 million in prior year. Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.95 as compared to $0.96 from the prior year third quarter. On the constant currency basis, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.09.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $118 million of cash and $40 million of debt. We expect to have the debt repaid by the end of the fiscal year. We generated $80 million in cash flows from operating activities this quarter, and we will continue to generate strong cash flows this fiscal year. Our liquidity position is also very strong.", "Now let's review our guidance for fiscal 2009. The slides posted in our website maybe helpful for following along in this section. The revenues and diluted earnings per share that we report will continue to be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.", "We also expect demand to continue to decline in the Human Capital group and the other category. We are reducing our full year EPS guidance to a range of $3.35 to $3.40. This guidance includes up to $0.35 of foreign currency translation losses from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We are bringing down our revenue guidance and we expect to report revenues in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.67 billion.", "We don't know how exchange rates will fluctuate over the remainder of our fiscal year. This guidance anticipates that over the next three months, the pound maintains a minimum average value of approximately $1.40 and the euro maintains a minimum average value of approximately a $1.30. This guidance assumes an income tax rate of 32% for the year and shares outstanding of approximately of $42.9 million for the year.", "Now, I'll walk through the revenue guidance for each of the segments. Please note that the slides on our website show both reported and constant currency revenue guidance. Since constant currency is the better measure of underlying business performance, I'll focus my remarks on the constant currency guidance.", "Let's start with benefits. Our benefits constant currency revenue guidance is 4 to 5% growth in fiscal 2009. We've narrowed the range as we are trending toward the lower end of our previous guidance. Our fiscal fourth quarter has less work days in fiscal '09 than in fiscal '08 due to the timing of the public holidays around Easter in UK and Europe. Normalizing benefits for the multi-employer business that we exited in fiscal 2008, revenue growth would be 5 to 6%.", "In the Technology and Administration Solutions group, we're tightening our range and expect constant currency revenue guidance of 11to 12% growth in fiscal 2009 as we are trending toward the high end of our previous range.", "In the Human Capital group, we're reducing our constant currency revenue guidance and now expect a 7 to 10% decline on a constant currency basis in fiscal 2009.", "In Insurance and Financial Services, we're narrowing the range and expect constant currency revenue growth of 13 to 15% for fiscal 2009. Lastly, we are increasing our constant currency Investment Consulting revenue growth slightly to 9 to 10% in fiscal 2009 reflecting the increase in client activity.", "These are tumultuous economic times for everyone, and it is difficult to predict how certain parts of our business will perform. We expect reported fourth quarter revenues will be in the range of 370 million to $390 million and reported diluted EPS will be in the range of $0.65 to $0.70.", "While this is a significant decline from last year, much of that drop is attributable to the strengthened dollar and the normalization of the tax rate, which was quite low in last year's quarter. And of course, this expectation is also impacted by the challenges faced in our Human Capital Group.", "We expect to record approximately $4 million of severance expenses during the fourth quarter. Also the fourth quarter diluted EPS may include up to $0.10 of foreign currency translation losses due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Fourth quarter revenue guidance by segment is presented on slide 4.", "In summary, many of our segments continue to perform well and those areas that are more cyclical, we are committed to running sensible businesses that provide value for the long-term.", "John J. Haley", "Thanks Roger. Now we'll take any questions that you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Josh Vogel from Sidoti & Co. Please proceed.", "Josh Vogel - Sidoti & Co.", "Hey good morning, thank you. You guys obviously did a good job, getting margins back up and keeping them up in the Insurance and Financial Services Group, and I think you guided for... was it high teens for the year. But as we look out to next year now, do you think... does that includes the margin in Q1 as you look at to next year or should we expect it to be mid-to-high 20% range?", "Roger Millay", "I think, at this point, because we haven't given guidance on 2010, and we're just in our budget process. What we've said about the insurance practice is that this year of course, we've raised our margins above what we guided early on. Early on, we said high single-digits and we were trying to get to, I believe it was the mid to upper teens in that practice. And I would say at that point, kind of over the longer-term probably the goal was still the same, although again we don't have specific guidance of point for 2010.", "Josh Vogel - Sidoti & Co.", "Okay. If I could just sneak in one, you just said the 4 million in severance expenses are included in your guidance for Q4. Is that mostly going to hit up in the Human Cap Group?", "Roger Millay", "A good portion of that will be. There is... we are taking actions around the company geographically and by practice, but a good portion of that will be in Human Capital.", "Josh Vogel - Sidoti & Co.", "Okay, great. I'll hop back in the queue. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. Please proceed.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Hi. I just wanted to ask about operating leverage in the business and obviously you showed some level of operating resilience in this quarter by doing some cutbacks and so on. But to what extent and what are the various other levers that you have there? If you were to have a, let's call it a flat to down revenue growth year in 2010, to what extent could you cut costs to keep margins?", "John Haley", "Well. I think Ashwin, salaries and benefits are our largest expense. And so headcount productions are the most significant way for us to contain our costs. There are some other cost management activities that we can and are pursuing. Some of the easiest ones related discretionary costs such as non-essential travel and certain internal meetings.", "We don't really expect to see much of our savings in FY '09, because the severance and the termination costs sort of eat up any savings you have. But at this point, we are estimating the full year run rate savings from our current cost reduction activities are around $20 million.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "And $20 million does not include anything incremental that you would do with regards to variable compensation and so on, what's...", "John Haley", "Right, that does include anything additional that we could do there.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, just looking at your benefits; in other words, a slight deceleration and probably splitting here. But I think couple of your competitors actually one shot, a slight uptick in growth. The other was kind of stable. Just wondering if there is anything benefit that sort of stood out why decelerate particularly with... I thought maybe some kind of benefit from the legislation change at the end of the recession. Thanks.", "John Haley", "Yeah, I think we... the U.K. retirement practice, both the U.S. and the UK we thought to perform reasonably well here. UK retirement practice probably had double-digit growth due to the additional workdays and not probably bit of the additional double digit growth. There is probably due to the additional work days and some additional work related to the economic client.", "The U.S. retirement had a mid single-digit growth rate and that was higher than the overall segment, the healthcare brought that down somewhat. But outside of the U.S. and the UK, the retirement practice also didn't perform as well as those two basic anchor positions that we have there. We thought this was reasonably good performance considering what was going on with the economy and it's consistent with what we see with most of our competitors.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Fones from UBS. Please proceed.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Yes, thanks. I wanted to ask about the guidance, just across the board, you're cutting kind of the revenue growth in terms of what you're expecting for the fourth quarter. You mentioned earlier in your comments that you are seeing regulatory work holdup. But more discretionary elements of your business have fallen off. And in terms of this guidance for the fourth quarter, is there... are you anticipating any kind of discretionary spending or have you taken a very kind of cautious look. I'm just surprised that the magnitude of their cuts in the revenue and the guidance for the fourth quarter?", "John Haley", "Just a couple of reactions there. One is, you look at the insurance practice as we've said in the past given the project nature of that practice that's more difficult to predict, and we tend to be cautious on predicting new incremental activity in that practice. I think in the technology segment, where we've talked the last couple of quarters about the potential for reduced discretionary spending, I think the results are coming in the way we had projected and the guidance does incorporate that trend to continue.", "I think that's a pretty solid trend that we've seen there. I think in other areas, what we've tried to do in the guidance is really reflect the trends that we see, and you can't say that there is no possibility for upside. But I think it's a pretty much consistent with trend as I said. I guess on the discretionary side, that's not project related. Again the guidance incorporates the trends we're seeing in HCG that's the practice that's most cyclical and most impacted by discretionary spending and the guidance just incorporates the trends that we are seeing, so...", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "And then just kind of finally, if we see kind of demand, kind of stabilize at the levels you are anticipating here in the fourth quarter next year. Do you believe that the cost cut... the severance that you've announced for the fourth quarter should be sufficient to maintain margins across your businesses at the levels you've historically said, these businesses should outperform.", "John Haley", "No, I think. What we're doing into as I mentioned in the call is that we're committed to maintaining our operating margins, and as Roger said, we're just going through right now with some of our projections for FY '10. But what we're focused on is a businesses to take the actions that we needed to keep our operating margins constant.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, and the only thing I'd add to that is again going back to HCG, which is the biggest story for the quarter, because that is cyclical. So the upturn on the top line end of margins back to where they were a year ago and that practice is dependent on the economy to a great extent, and we're taking cost out.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Right.", "Roger Millay", "But certainly maintaining margins there is very difficult.", "John Haley", "Yeah, what I think is to the overall business we are committed to maintaining those, and we're not worried so much about a particular quarter or not, but to get to the right long-term operating level.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Okay, thanks. That was helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Mark Marcon from Robert W. Baird.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Good morning. I was wondering if you could a little bit about just the tone from your clients and to what extent do you think the recent performance particularly in HCG, just kind of due to a little bit of shock in terms of what happened across the global economy and to what extent do you think the path for cooperation would be?", "John Haley", "Yeah, so each client has really their own potentials, their own little story. So, it's hard to generalize too much. But I do think... when we solve the stories about the U.S. economy shooting more than people had thought in the first quarter as business spending being down being large part of that, that looks pretty consistent with what we've seen in HCG, where a lot of people just sort of stop some discretionary spending on that. We believe that that's the kind of thing that we've picked back up as the prospects for our clients get better, and it's the way we've seen it happen in the past, I mean was notably in the early 2000. We had a period of some uncertainty and decline there, and then new prospects picked up, HCG did very well. So, this is the kind of thing we have to think about in terms of running with business to make sure. We're prepared to need our clients need as prospects get better to make sure that we don't take some major reactions to just a quarter or two, but also make sure that we continue to run profitable business.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Great. And can you talk a little bit about the... what you are seeing in terms of pension legislation and what you think that may end up doing in terms of future demand as it relates to the actual real work?", "John Haley", "Yeah, we actually don't think, we're going to see any additional legislation related to pension funding in the near future. We did get some IRS guidance issued in late March, which provides significant short-term relief to most plan sponsors, and we think that guidance decreases the likelihood of any additional legislator funding relief in the near future.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "And what do you think the longer term outlook is there?", "John Haley", "Well. Longer-term it's hard to go by... longer term, there's always some pension legislation that's coming about, but I wouldn't... there is nothing that I would I could point you to say I expect legislation in this particular areas as appose to some other one.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. In the Human Capital Group, the loss I just want to ask you if you could give me the exact dollar amount that was severance in the unit and what the loss I mean with other severances just I am trying to get to?", "John Haley", "I believe... for the fourth quarter?", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes.", "John Haley", "The loss was about $600,000 and the severance was about 500,000.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "So, what was the severance in the whole year? I'm trying to figure out where was all the other severance going?", "John Haley", "You mean...", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "I mean in the quarter", "Roger Millay", "...for the quarter?", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yeah.", "Roger Millay", "It was spread around as I said earlier, kind of in other geographies and other practices. So, that was really a smattering. There were one of the reasons that you see a small amount in HCG this quarter is because we did have some severance in Europe and some other practices during the quarter that magnitude, the dollar magnitude generally is higher than in some other geographic areas. So again, it's spread around practices and spread around geographies.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "What was the total number for the quarter of severance?", "Roger Millay", "It was $3 million.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "So, in the hardest hit group, you only had 0.5 million in severance and you had other groups, where you had higher levels of severance, is that correct?", "Roger Millay", "That's correct.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "And is there anything cyclical going on within the Benefits Group? I mean if you go historically into last downturn and this group also was impacted and I believe that had something to do with M&A work that resulted in some tension work later on in the cycle. Is there any of that happening right now?", "John Haley", "No, I think Benefits is about where we had expected. It's right within the range we had expected. We talked about Benefits as being a mid-single digit revenue growth practice; and in fact, if we adjust for the multi-employer business that we sold on the constant currency basis, we're right around 5% here.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. I'm going to try and squeeze one last of housekeeping thing. Can you walk us through the affiliated income there and what kind of expectation should we have for that line moving around over the next few quarters?", "John Haley", "Yeah, the biggest piece I guess of the volatility in that line is the insurance affiliate that we have, PCIC and that does bounce from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter. We also, I believe added a bit this quarter from the income that we're getting from the retained interest in the multi-employer sale that we made a year ago.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company. Please proceed.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co.", "Yes, just quickly following up on that prior one. Can I maybe ask what you might be assuming for that line as we go onto the fourth quarter in your guidance?", "Roger Millay", "Again, I think it's... the assumptions generally are pretty modest. And that's one of the reasons I think we do occasionally have surprises there, because it is unpredictable and bounces up and down. I quite honestly don't have a specific number for affiliate.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co.", "Okay. And then the Human Capital Group, you mentioned in your comments that March was particularly weak. Can you maybe give a little more color on that relative to the overall quarter's performance and as that is the growth rate you're implying for the second quarter... I'm sorry, for the fiscal fourth quarter really a continuation of those March levels. Are you assuming if it gets worse from even March or better than that?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, let me just mention a little bit about this. I think that when we were looking back at the end of calendar '08, and we were looking at the drop in economic activity, one another thing we thought we might see in the beginning of calendar '09 so that, our third fiscal quarter was a drop in HCG in the Human Capital activity. And indeed one of the surprises we had was that January and February didn't drop as much, but then we saw March dropped a great deal from the January, February level. So I think we were surprised that it didn't occur sooner and then it was a very dramatic drop when it occurred. We've taken the March level and projected actually down from there to get to our fourth quarter projections.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co.", "Okay, thank you.", "John Haley", "Actually, just to the earlier question on other in affiliate, I believe baked in our guidance is slightly lower level of affiliate income for the fourth quarter than in the third quarter and also just to clarify on the on the multi-employer income that's coming in... that's coming in on the other line rather than the affiliate line.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co.", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust Humphrey. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning this is Frank in for Tobey. Cash flow was pretty strong during the quarter, wanted to get your perspective in terms how you are looking at asphalt (ph) repurchases, acquisitions and uses of the cash going forward. And then if I could squeeze in a quick, could you disclose the amount of U.S. versus non-U.S. exposure on the Human Capital Group you mentioned. U.S. had some positive trends there.", "John Haley", "This is John; let me take the first part of that.", "Roger Millay", "Sure.", "John Haley", "In think one of the things that we like being in a strong cash position as Roger mentioned, we expect to repay any debt we have during this quarter and our liquidity position is very strong. Generally we've taken the position that we would prefer to do acquisitions, and we're always on the lookout for doing acquisitions that will make some sense. I think we are... when we look at acquisitions, we tend to be focused on ones that are good cultural fit and ones that are good strategic fit, and we're less focused on maybe trying to get some bargain basement prices on things. I mean we don't want over pay, but we're not necessarily ones that are sort of bottom feeding on some of those.", "So we are continuing to look for acquisitions the same as we had in the past, and we're glad to be in a position, where we could look at doing that. If we don't see something like that in the past, we've looked at things as to whether we might return money to shareholders by doing a share repurchase we did one last year. I think it was in February of last year, we commenced one and did that throughout most of 2008. We don't have any plans for one right now, but it's always something that we would think about.", "Roger Millay", "On the second question... sorry. Revenue for the Human Capital Group is about 50% little under 50% in U.S.", "Unidentified Analyst", "All right, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We have a follow up questions from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks. Just wondering if there was, how you can size or is any impact on the market rally recently in the investment consulting division, and is there obviously an effect into your guidance and anyway to sort of size that force? Thanks.", "John Haley", "Yeah, I'm not sure how sensitive that is to the market value. We think we saw the pickup in some of the investment consulting activity, a little bit before. Then clearly the events of calendar 2008, when we had the big market shock, also gave a shock to activity in that area. But it's not sensitive to the daily ups and downs of the market.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Mainly just two quick follow-ups and I thought in the back half of the year, some of the degradation in that growth rate was because of some of your funds and demands of fees or piece by piece like that.", "John Haley", "I see what you're saying. Yes, and there is... to some extend, our revenues are... it's less than 20% of our revenues are sort of performance or asset based. So there is some impact to that. But I think that's not the biggest part of the change.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Great, and then it sounds like from your earlier comments that you're still advising managers not to change pension slots not to change managers yet; is that correct?", "John Haley", "I think what we're telling them is to is to go slow on this to evaluate carefully what's going on. This is a market that has seen a lot of changes and they should just do anything very carefully. We're not recommending necessarily making wholesale changes.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "So, I just... holding on that, is it true that when you start recommending making changes that would have a positive impact?", "John Haley", "It could. I think the point... so what happens is, we have this enormous change in the market in calendar 2008. And one of the things that you people might think is that we would immediately go out and recommend that that everybody go and chase the manager from ones that lost the money further with the others. But what we've said was... let's step back and look at this overall and let's plan sensibly for the long-term. I am not sure that we are going to go out and recommend wholesale changes to anybody. We're going to recommend that they evaluate it manager-by-manager and see what fits in with and what the investment philosophy is.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have another follow up question from the line of Mark Marcon from Robert W. Baird.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "I wanted to focus a little bit more on coming from longer-term outlook. I was wondering first of all, John, you mentioned, you want to maintain the margins. What margin levels were you specifically referring to in terms of... are you thinking about the '07ish kind of levels, the '08 kind of levels. Where are you thinking in terms of operating profits in terms of both, and I know it's a full year as opposed to next few quarters?", "John Haley", "No, I think if we just step back and look at this, in '07, we had pretty good margins. They've had some years where they have been trending up. And we said, we still thought long-term that was probably some incremental improvement we could get year-to-year. But in '08, we had of course quite an extraordinarily good year. We believe that we can... the '07 with some small incremental improvements or probably some good long-term estimates for what we can do.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about... obviously, this is unusually difficult environment. Can you talk a little bit about what you would think would be a conservative point-of-view with regards to the long-term growth rates within the individual divisions.", "John Haley", "I think the benefits, which we had talked about being in the mid single-digits in 4 to 6% is the kind of longer-term growth rate, maybe even 4 to 5 units (ph). That would... I think that's still a good long-term wait for that. If I look at the investment consulting, we've talked about that as a business that we think has some more years of some higher growth, and I think we still expect to see that to grow at least in the 10% or higher range for the near term.", "The union capital, the short-term obviously were projecting that things are going to get... we're going to see more shrinkage coming-in in the short-term, but if you're asking about what the long-term rate is, I think the rate around 9-10% is something that we think is a good longer term rate for growth there. I think insurance, we would probably say the same kind of thing that we expect somewhere around 9 to 10% is a good longer term growth rate for that. And we would look at our administration as probably closer to benefits about the mid single-digits.", "So I think if you step back and you look at what we might have done a year ago in terms of what we would talk about as long-term growth rates, and then I'm really emphasizing long-term here, I'm not talking about what's going to happen over the next year or so. But if we look at the long-term growth rates, they're probably not that different. I think the only one that might be a little more moderated would be the investment consulting.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And in terms of Human Capital, I mean in a challenged environment, what would you aspire to get the margins to?", "John Haley", "Well, I don't know is the answer to that right off hand. And the key here is that with Human Capital, what we need to do is go and look at things specifically and see weather we think the imbalances we have are short-term or long-term. We really deliver some long... with some short-term imbalances.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Sure.", "John Haley", "We think there is the right opportunities. As we've going through and being doing some of this, we found things that we think are longer term imbalances and that's where we're acting on immediately.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay.", "John Haley", "So I think it really to, we have to do a fuller look at that, but that's the criteria we will use to distinguish.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Hi, I just wanted to return to the answer that you had given to my question on what kind of savings you can get from cost cutting and various other things and you had started with a $20 million savings number, which is I think is roughly $0.30 EPS, which it seems to me that should be efficient to overcome modest single-digit shrinkage plus the impact of I guess your pension related headwind in fiscal 2010 and still give you very modest EPS growth. I don't want to put, I know you don't have 2010 guidance out there. Don't want to put words in your mouth but could you run through or some of the... at least the puts and takes qualitatively as we think about nearer term? People are worried about fiscal 2010, what might to do? Could you provide more color?", "John Haley", "Sure. I think Ashwin, let me just say this: I think we had agreed with the overall sort of channel of what your remarks are there. I'd emphasize though what you just said over larger set, we are actually in the middle right now of doing our FY '10 planning. So, we can't tell you anything specific about that. But overall, when we started looking at the kind of cost reductions we have here, they seem like they were in a kind of cost reductions, but for the most part should get us towards balancing what we say as perhaps some increases, we could get an increase Benefits expense for things we could get... we could have some revenue declines. Overall, they look like their order of magnitude about right, but we haven't got into the final balancing. That's one of the reason though we said earlier also that we were looking at trying to maintain our margins, because we think that this is a pretty good way towards balancing any revenue losses or cost increases we have.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "That's fair. But once you take that into the cash flow impact. Can you talk then about the cash flow impact and are you likely to given the performance this year likely to have similar kind of variable comp sales as you had in good years? The last couple of years, you're like to start off with a negative balance if you go on your... essentially on your credit line; it drilled down the credit line and so on. If you could take it from margins and EPS, which looks like flat to slightly up is a good starting point, take it to cash flow and explain.", "John Haley", "Yeah. I think, well I'll let Roger talk about cash flow. Let me just deal with the variable comp issue. Over the years, we try to look at these and say in general, we've like our net income and our variable comp to be growing at about the same rate. Now they don't grow the same rate necessarily every quarter-to-quarter or do that in times when we had some... we've had times, where we've grown the variable comp faster than the net earnings and we've got times, where we've actually grown the net income faster than the variable comp. But on average we try to get them to be growing at about the same rate. I think that's still a philosophy. We'd like to try and do that, but in specific quarters or specific years, we might depart from that.", "Talk about the cash flow.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, Ashwin I might say some things on cash flow that sounds like kind of blend and generic. But our expectation is, it is a good cash flowing business and we expect that to continue in the scenario that you pose it with slightly growing earnings. Cash flow in general should pretty much follow. So, in terms of what we do with the credit facility and free cash and then to the earlier question of how we would think about what to do with free cash. I mean, I think all those things would be in relatively the same balance as they are right now, so...", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "And you're not seeing anything out of the ordinary with working capital with clients, elections and things like that.", "Roger Millay", "No. I mean there are... this is the time where you see more kind of anecdotal kind of one off, receivables pressure, but there is nothing systemic that we're seeing that impacts out of our cash flow.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask you to go over what's the healthcare consulting work? You said that it was at week in the quarter. If you could just describe a little bit more about what was going on over there and what was driving that?", "Roger Millay", "I think in general, healthcare was down. I don't have a lot of anecdotes or details on that. In general, we sense that perhaps clients were... their activity around healthcare is kind of more project oriented and then perhaps a little more discretionary that clearly impacted us. We think that that's still an area of good prospects for us. As healthcare changes come in, we believe that we will benefit from that. I don't know that we saw any specific kind of systemic pressures there that we think are indicative of a longer term outcome, it's just a little more volatile and kind of cyclical segment.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Can you give me the magnitude of the year-over-year impacts on healthcare?", "Roger Millay", "Again, it's a pretty small part of benefits. I don't have a number. I think it was a single-digit kind of decline I think. And from a revenue point-of-view that might mean for the quarter 1 million or $2 of revenue... million or 2 million of revenue.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Fones from UBS.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Yes, thank you. I had a follow up to my question about revenue guidance. And I think you guys reached number of HCG already, but I was wondering if you could tell us at least directionally where growth stood in March on a constant currency basis perhaps relative to where you've guided so. Have you guided in terms of fourth quarter growth inline with March above or below just across the other businesses? Thanks.", "Roger Millay", "I don't know when you say across the other businesses, you lost me a little bit. But I think your question of first quarter guidance for HCG, we used March as the benchmark and projected that trend generally into the fourth quarter.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Sorry, my comment on the businesses was, I think your guidance was HCG previously. I was wondering if you could do that for the other businesses.", "Roger Millay", "For the other four segments, trending of March, well. Again, I'll have to say, I think this was the question I tried to answer earlier when I kind of highlighted insurance, I think that's really the only practice that we didn't project the third quarter trends into the fourth quarter again because it's so project related and we had this M&A type influence. We're just a little bit more conservative there I think otherwise, I cant specifically talk to March, but generally we took what we saw in the quarter and as the quarter developed and used that as the benchmark for the fourth quarter.", "John Haley", "Yeah, I think the only thing I would add to that is that implicit of what Roger is saying is that for the other practices, March wasn't necessarily all that distinguished January and February.", "Roger Millay", "Right, that's right.", "John Haley", "The only thing that came into play a little bit is this issue of Easter in the UK. And Easter in the UK added a couple days of revenue to some of our businesses, and we didn't project... we normalize for that and then did our projections.", "Roger Millay", "Absolutely right.", "John Haley", "And then that it seems like a funny thing to talk about Easter, but actually the impact of whether that falls in the third or fourth quarter is a big impact. We discussed last year on the call, I think when we were talking about the third and fourth quarter results as to where that falls.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Yeah, it sounds as though benefits could be hold enough. If I might, organic numbers of benefits constant currency in the quarter is about four. I think you said five, but it was and you said us about 2% impact from Easter, either 2% benefit from Easter. So we just in for about, it doesn't look like you've seen any kind of demand fall off from the 13 to the fourth quarter.", "John Haley", "I'm not sure how much Easter was. It was a couple of days, where things in the UK, and so the overall... one of the reasons that we have might have had a slightly higher number for benefits was... it's a question of whether or not we adjust for the multiemployer business.", "Roger Millay", "Right.", "John Haley", "That adds a percent or two.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Here from Robert W. Baird, your next question comes from Mark Marcon.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Can you talk a little bit about what your clients are seeing from pricing perspective? Are you getting pressure to reduce your fees and how are you responding?", "John Haley", "Well, I think pricing is always competitive, and we continue to see that now. But I don't think there is anything that say a big systemic change that we're necessary seeing there. The issue tends to be around whether projects are gone forward and that's what's ahead of us.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Yeah, so it's more on the project as opposed to you'd like just you sharpen your pencil.", "John Haley", "Yeah, I mean it's always competitive when it's probably a little more competitive now than it had been. But that's not where we see the issues.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And then can you just... in terms of your experience, how long do you think if we go back to last downturn and comparing and contrasting the environment today to that period, how long do you think that could be before HCG normalizes?", "John Haley", "These things are always hard to say. I'm probably more optimistic in front of the others. This may surprise you. But I actually think that, I think from when we start to see a real pick up, it might only be a quarter to two. So we'll have... I think there would be a wide divergence of opinion I think within the firm if you would ask people out.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And when you're saying a pick-up, do you mean GDP or do you mean employment?", "John Haley", "Well, a lot of what we do with HCG tends to be related to labor force mobility. And so, when we see that happening, that's always a good sign for us. Some of the downturn some of the projects and the way the projects are cut here seem to be more related though to just the GDP fall-off and cuts in business spending generally. So it's probably a combination of those. I think we will certainly see some pick up in HCG once GDP picks up. And I think once we get employment and labor force mobility, we'll probably continue to see more.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, I show we have no further questions in queue. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. John Haley for closing remarks.", "John Haley", "Okay. Well, again thanks very much everyone for joining us. We look forward to reviewing our fourth quarter results with you in August.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

We will also give an update on the status of our planned merger with Towers Perrin.", "The slowdown in the global economy continued to affect us, but we've executed well in the current conditions.  Our revenues for the fiscal year were $1.68 billion, down 5% from prior year, but up 3% on a constant currency basis.", "For the year, our reported diluted earnings per share were $3.42.  Our diluted earnings per share include $0.12 of severance and $0.35 of foreign currency translation losses.  On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS that excludes severance is $3.89.", "For the quarter, our reported revenues were $397 million, a decline of 13% from prior year and 4% on a constant currency basis.  Our performance varied by segment.  On a constant currency basis, Benefits was flat, Technology and Administration Solutions increased 2%, Human Capital Group declined 27%, Insurance and Financial Services declined 6%, and Investment Consulting increased 14%.", "These results reflect the stability of the Benefits and Technology and Administration Solutions segments, and the variability of our more project-driven segments, Human Capital Group and Insurance and Financial Services.  The recovery continues in Investment Consulting as it is experiencing good growth.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.73, a $0.22 decline from the prior period's $0.95 per share.  The strengthening of the US dollar resulted in a $0.10 reduction to our EPS and severance reduced EPS by $0.07.  Therefore, if we exclude the effects of changes in forward exchange rates and severance, our EPS is $0.90.  ", "Our operating margin increased to 12.8% this quarter as we were very focused on containing costs.  Business is performing as expected in areas where we have a well-established market position, mature relationships, and recurring business.  As anticipated, demand was down in the parts of our business that are more project driven.", "The uncertain economic conditions are affecting benefit programs and workforce demographics at many companies.  We continue to assist our clients with practical solutions for reducing costs and managing risks.", "Now we'll review the performance of our segments.  For the year, Benefits Group revenues were $960 million, a decrease of 3% from prior year, but up 4% on a constant currency basis.  For the quarter, Benefit Group revenues were $234 million a decrease of 8% from prior year and flat on a constant currency basis.", "The trends from last quarter continued and we had modest growth in our retirement services in the US and the UK.  The growth was offset by modest declines in demand for our retirement services in continental Europe and Asia Pacific, and for healthcare consulting.  ", "While it is difficult to predict future results in these uncertain times, we expect that our core retirement services will continue to do well in the US and the UK.  We have modest expectations for healthcare consulting in countries where we have a smaller footprint.  In the US, employers are interested in ways to improve the operation of the retirement programs and better manage risk.  ", "The retirement plan decisions employers make over the next few years will be critical to the viability of the country's voluntary retirement system and will have an economic impact on employers, regardless of who bears the direct financial risk in the benefit design.", "We will continue to provide practical and innovative solutions to our clients.  ", "In Europe, European Pensions Magazine recently named Watson Wyatt their consultancy of the year for the second year in a row.  The judges base their decision on our standing service to pension fund clients, dedication to the delivery of pension plan consulting, superior understanding of the market's needs, and commitment to excellence.  This is a tribute to our very talented team.", "We continue to have a solid base of revenues that is relatively predictable within our retirement practice.", "Now let's move onto the Technology and Administration Solutions Group.  For the year, revenues were $188 million, a 3% increase over prior year and 11% on a constant currency basis.  For the quarter, revenues were $45 million, down 7% from prior year, but up 2% on a constant currency basis.  On a pre-deferral basis, constant currency revenue growth was 1%.  In this segment, our constant currency growth in the UK was offset in part by a modest decline in the US.  In the UK, our growth was due primarily to new clients that had gone live within the past 12 months.  The decline in the US was due to less change order work at existing clients than is immediately recognizable as revenues, and to an increase in the amount of revenue deferred.", "Last year we mentioned that proposal activity had increased.  We are pleased to report that we have had some good wins in both the UK and the US.  The wins in the UK will contribute to revenue growth in FY10 and the wins in the US will initially result in deferred revenues as we complete the system implementation work.  Roger will discuss FY10 guidance in more detail.", "We continue to have excellent client retention rates and a stable platform of revenues globally in this segment.  The administration services that we provide are a compelling proposition for companies looking to control costs, and we expect to gain market share.", "Next let me turn to the Human Capital Group.  For the year, revenues were $173 million, a 12% decrease from prior year and an 8% decrease on a constant currency basis.", "For the quarter, revenues were $35 million, down 31% from prior year and down 27% on a constant currency basis.  The trends for March continued into the fourth quarter.  Demand was soft in all regions. Compensation, organizational effectiveness, and data services all declined when compared to prior year fourth quarter.", "Our colleagues in the Human Capital Group are now beginning to see an increase in proposal activity and we're hopeful that we're seeing the bottoming of the cycle in this practice.  As the business landscape continues to change, many companies will be operating with a smaller workforce.  We are well positioned to assist companies with flexible targeted plans designed to attract and retain critical talent in this new reality.", "Now I'll discuss the Insurance and Financial Services Group.  For the year, revenues were $117 million, a decrease of 1% over prior year, but up 13% on a constant currency basis.  For the quarter revenues were $23 million, down 21% from prior year and down 6% on a constant currency basis.  This was a particularly soft quarter in Europe.  We had less project activity this quarter than in the past two quarters.  We have also seen some falloff in demand as companies defer work or take projects in-house.  It is difficult to predict the timing and magnitude of projects, but there's still activity in the sector.  We think there may be some transaction work as companies continue to evaluate capital adequacy.", "Lastly, Investment Consulting reported revenues of $161 million for the year, a decrease of 5% from prior year, but an increase of 10% on a constant currency basis.  For the quarter, revenues were $42 million, a decrease of 3% from prior year, but an increase of 14% on a constant currency basis.  ", "We are pleased with our growth in this segment.  We've seen an increase in our implemented consulting activities, due in part to several expanded client relationships.  We're also seeing an increase in strategy products.  Many funds are evaluating their investment strategy and risk tolerance; they are concluding that continued diversification of portfolios is the right way to control risks going forward.  We continue to be optimistic about the longer-term growth prospects for this segment.", "Wrapping up, I'd like to thank your associates for their continued commitment to quality client service.  We've executed well in these uncertain economic times and we continue to focus on sound business fundamentals and disciplined cost control.  We will continue to stay close to clients to help them respond effectively to these uncertain times.  ", " Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger F. Millay", "Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone.  We continued to operate effectively in the last part of the year.  In addition to the Towers-Watson announcement, we spent a good deal of time in the quarter assessing our business momentum relative to the cost-control actions we've taken and validating our view of the new fiscal year.", "While we did suffer a constant currency revenue decline this quarter, it fell into the rage of our expectations and we're pleased that our earnings came in slightly better than our expectation, despite a higher than forecasted income-tax rate.", "For the quarter, our operating income margin was 12.8%, an increase from 11.3% in the prior year quarter.  Excluding severance costs, our operating margin was 14.0% for the fourth quarter.  ", "As John noted, the performance of our segments vary and we've had profitability pressure in our more project-driven areas.  We've had some layoffs in our under-performing areas, and we'll continue to monitor our costs.  Some of our segments will perform better than others and we may have some variability in our quarterly results, but we're focused on preserving our margins.", "The Benefits Group had a 30% margin for the year, an increase from 29% last year.  For the quarter, the Benefits Group had a 30% margin, consistent with the fourth quarter of last year.  These margins are consistent with our expectations for benefits.", "Technology and Administration Solutions had a 24% margin for the year, a decline from 26% last year.  For the quarter, Technology and Administration Solutions had a 19% margin, a decline from 26% in the fourth quarter of last year.  Excluding severance, the margin was 20%.", "Margin declined significantly in North America due mainly to a decline in change order work.  Human Capital Group had a 7% margin for the year, a significant decline from 18% last year.  This year includes approximately $3.3 million of severance.  For the quarter, the Human Capital Group had a loss of $5 million.  The loss includes $2.4 million of severance.  We are closely monitoring our loss generating offices and are downsizing under-performing locations.  ", "As we said last quarter, we're focused on reshaping the practice to make it more profitable for the longer term.", "Insurance and Financial Services had a 15% margin for the year, a significant increase from last year.  All regions performed better this fiscal year.  For the quarter, Insurance and Financial Services lost $2 million.  This loss includes about $500,000 of severance.  The loss this quarter is due to a decrease in project work.  ", " ", "Investment Consulting had a 28% margin for the year, a decrease from 35% last year.  For the quarter, Investment Consulting had a 33% margin, a decrease from 35$ in the fourth quarter of last year.  We think the long-term sustainable margin for this segment is around 30%.  ", "The segment margins that we've just reviewed are before consolidation of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles resulting from our acquisitions.  Net income for the year was $146 million, down from $155 million last year.  Net income for the quarter was $31 million, a decrease from $42 million last year.  ", "Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.73 as compared to $0.95 in the prior year fourth quarter.  Diluted earnings per share for the quarter include $0.10 of foreign currency translation losses and $0.07 of severance.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the fiscal year with $210 million of cash and no debt.  We generated $228 million in cash flows from operating activities this fiscal year and had a strong fourth quarter, generating $144 million of cash from operations.  Our liquidity position is also very strong.  ", "Now let's review our guidance for fiscal 2010.  I should note that all of this guidance contemplates Watson Wyatt as an independent company without the merger with Towers Perrin for the full fiscal year 2010.  The slides posted on our website may be helpful for following along in this section.", "On slide three we've created a baseline fiscal 2009 that excludes severance from our quarterly reported results.  Internally this is how we're evaluating our performance.  Our fiscal 2010 reported results will include some severance, as we did not complete all of the actions identified in fiscal 2009.  Our fiscal 2010 results will also be impacted by merger costs and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  ", "Our forecast for 2010 generally assumes that market conditions remain as is for the next several quarters.  On a constant currency basis we're targeting both revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be roughly flat with fiscal 2009 levels.  Our constant currency revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.61-$1.68 billion.  Our constant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.45-$3.55.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes severance and other nonrecurring merger costs.  ", "For fiscal 2010, our forward-looking guidance assumes an average exchange rate of 1.65 US dollars to the British pound and an average exchange rate of 1.40 US dollars to the euro.  These foreign currency exchange rate assumptions result in foreign currency translation losses in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and translation gains for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues in fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $1.63-$1.70 billion.  We expected adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.50-$3.60.  This guidance excludes $4 million of severance that we expect to incur in fiscal 2010, more than half of which will be in the first quarter.  It also excludes merger costs.  We expect $8-$10 million of merger costs will be expensed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 due to the adoption of the new accounting standard for business combinations that requires acquisition costs to be expensed. We will have additional merger costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.", "This guidance assumes an income tax rate of 34% for adjusted EPS in fiscal 2010.  The actual rate may be higher due to the non-deductibility of certain merger costs.  We also assume no significant changes in diluted shares outstanding during the year.", "Our capital expenditures plan for fiscal 2010 was put together before we announced the pending merger and included approximately $50 million in CapEx for the year, split roughly 50-50 between purchases and capitalized software costs.  We expect to have strong cash flows in fiscal 2010.  Due to the timing of cash receipts and payments, we typically borrow from our credit facility in the first quarter and then repay the debt during the fiscal year.  In fiscal 2010 we may borrow up to $10 million or so in the first quarter, and we would expect to have that repaid by the end of the second quarter.", "Now I'll walk through the guidance for each of the segments.  Please note that the slides on our website show both reported and constant currency revenue guidance.  Since constant currency is the better measure of underlying business performance, I'll focus my remarks on the constant currency guidance.  ", "Let's start with Benefits.  For fiscal 2010 we've changed the reporting of the administration business in Germany, which has been in the Benefits practice since the Heissmann acquisition.", "To the Technology and Administration Solutions practice, we believe this change will benefit operating effectiveness and growth.  As a result, in our segment reporting we're reclassifying our Germany administration business from Benefits to Technology and Administration Solutions.  On slide four you can see the fiscal 2009 Benefits and Technology and Administration Solutions results, after the reclassification.  On a constant currency basis and after the reclass, we expect flat to very modest revenue growth in the Benefits practice and have a range of 0%-2% growth.  This guidance reflects the relatively stable and predictable revenues in this segment, and the slower growth that comes further along in an economic downturn.  We expect margin will be in the high 20% range.", "In the Technology and Administration Solutions Group, after the reclassification of the Germany administration business, we expect constant currency growth in the range of 1%-3%.  This growth reflects the new clients in Europe for which we started administration work during fiscal 2009 and for which we will have a full year of revenues in fiscal 2010.  We expect margin will be in the mid-20% range.", "In the Human Capital Group we're expecting challenging conditions to continue.  Our constant currency revenue projection is for a 16%-26% decline in revenue.  The wide range reflects the project nature of the segment.  We expect to move the business back to breakeven during the fiscal year, but may start out with a loss.", "In Insurance and Financial Services we expect a decline of 5%-11% in constant currency revenues.  This segment also has a significant project component.  In fiscal 2009 we had a few large projects that we do not expect to recur.  We're expecting margin in the low double digits.  Lastly, we're expecting constant currency revenue growth in Investment Consulting of 7%-10% in fiscal 2010.  Client activity has begun to return to more normal levels as market conditions have improved.  We expect margin will be in the high-20% range.", "In summary, for fiscal 2010 we're projecting roughly flat constant currency revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share.  We also expect to preserve our baseline operating margin before consideration of severance and merger costs.", "Now I'll provide a brief overview of our first fiscal quarter of 2010.  We expect revenues to be in the range of $385-$400 million, which on a constant currency basis would be in the range of $405-$420 million, essentially flat to down 3%.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2009 our operating margin, excluding severance, was 12%.  We expect to have a similar operating margin, excluding severance and merger costs, in the first quarter of 2010.  We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be within the range of $0.68-$0.73.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes severance and transaction costs.", "This guidance was for Watson Wyatt's current business and does not include the effects of a merger with Towers Perrin.  We announced our intent to merge with Towers Perrin in June, and anticipate the transaction will close during our fiscal 2010.  As we approach the closing date, financial information and expectations regarding the combined Towers Watson will gradually become more available, beginning with the initial S4 filing later this month.", "We're committed to running disciplined businesses before and after the pending merger.  Now John will give you an update on the status of the merger.", "John J. Haley", "Thanks, Roger.  Since we announced the merger, Mark Mactas and I have been holding employee meeting with associates at both Watson Wyatt and Towers Perrin.  We're gratified by the reception we're getting and are delighted that associates at organizations are embracing the future prospects of the new organization.", "I'm also pleased to report that we are working through all of the pre-closing requirements and we're planning for integration.  Last week we received clearance from the US antitrust authorities.  The European Union antitrust authorities are still reviewing the transaction.  By the end of this month we expect to file the S4.  As of now, we're still on track for a shareholder vote in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2009.", "We're really excited about the merger and the opportunity for Towers Watson to address merging financial and people management issues with world-class expertise.  Now we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator's Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Fones with UBS.  Please proceed with your question.", " ", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "", "Yes.  Thanks, John.  I was wondering if you could just kind of give us a sense of how Towers Perrin's results looked for the third quarter and whether you're kind of satisfied with the performance of their business in this touch economy, post the initial announcement?  Thanks.", "Roger F. Millay", "I think in general the themes are pretty similar to what we said, I don't know, five weeks or so ago, that there were a lot of parallels in between our practices and Towers' business, and that general trends are pretty similar, so I think we're still in that same pattern.", "John J. Haley", "I mean, I guess just to elaborate on that, I mean, obviously we haven't disclosed any of the real detailed financial information on Towers Perrin or for our projection for Towers Watson and that won't come until after the S4.  But Towers Perrin is in similar businesses to us, although the mix of business that they have is different, but they're affected by the same overall economic factors.  So the results on them may be slightly different simply due to mix, but it's probably not due to overall economic factors acting differently on either one of us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  Please proceed with your question.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Thank you.  I was wondering if I could get a little more color about some assumptions embedded into your guidance.  I am curious what \u2014 and I may have missed this, I apologize as you did give an awful lot of detail.  I am curious as to what the cash flow may be implied in the earnings range, and then also what sort of assumption you're using for the bonus number in fiscal 2010.  Thanks.", "John J. Haley", "Yeah.  In terms of cash flow we didn't give specific cash flow numbers for the year.  I think our discussion was a little more general.  The main reason for that is that the full year, from an overall merger cost point of view, is obviously unpredictable at this point, but we continue to expect, as I said, a strong cash flow year, but we didn't give a specific number.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "So ex the acquisition related variability, something consistent with historic norms?", "John J. Haley", "Yeah. I would say something in that same range.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay.  And then is there anything you can share with us about the implied expectation for the bonus in the context of guidance?", "Roger F. Millay", "I'm sorry, I missed that question.", "John J. Haley", "He's asked if there was anything we could share about the bonus in the expectation of \u2014", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah.  I mean, I would say just in general \u2014 I don't know, John, if you want to address that as well, but in general, the way we modeled the year, the focus, as we said in the remarks, was to hold operating margin and EPS roughly flat.  So through the year the bonus level will be impacted by what the results of the company are, the bonus level may be a little bit lower depending on performance, but our focus will be on retaining margins.  And then of course the other complication we're going to have through the year is that we're likely to have about a six-month stub year and we'll be attentive to that as well.  So that's why we're focused on the margin and the EPS level.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay.  Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.  Please proceed with your question.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "", "Thanks.  Just go back to Towers in the fourth quarter, can you give us any more specificity on the revenue?  I think you were down 4% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter and you're looking for sort of zero to minus 4 in the next year.  Can you give us just a little bit more clarity on what Towers Perrin was looking like?  Was it worse or better than you in the fourth quarter and is their revenue range about similar?  And the same thing on the margin \u2014 I think this is something that investors are quite focused on. Thanks.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah.  We don't have any specific numbers for Towers that are comparable to ours at this point, so again, as I said, I think the first preview on actual numbers with Towers will be in the S4 later this month.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Okay.  So how do you know what the expected dilution that you talked about in the last call is going to be if you don't have those numbers?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, I mean, certainly we had numbers when we came up with the accretion dilution numbers and we used projections to do that, and that's what we discussed.  That's the basis for the discussion in June, and as we said at that time, the next step in the disclosure of the numbers that we expect for the combined company and the next step in specifics on Towers Perrin numbers will be in the S4.  I think we're at the same place in what we said before.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup.  Please proceed with your question.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "", "Hi, John.  Hi, Roger.  Coming out of the last downturn, the whole Benefits unit took a couple of years to start doing well and eventually sort of needed the Pension Act to breakout, if you will.  What do you expect this time around, given that in August the composition of the unit is different both geographically and in terms of just having the healthcare being a bigger component of it?", "John J. Haley", "Yeah.  I guess I'm not necessarily sure that it was the Pension Act that I would have necessarily said was the difference there in the last time in changing it.  But I do think that after the slowdown \u2014 what we tend to notice is when there's an economic slowdown, Benefits, particularly retirement consulting, isn't really hit that much.  In fact, some of the work that they might lose in project work gets substituted for with other work, and I think we saw that this last year when our Benefits was up 4% on a constant currency basis.  ", "What tends to happen to Benefits is it's a little bit slower sort of in the calm after the storm, and that's why we're projecting a 2% constant growth for Benefits for FY10.  So we're looking at what happened in the past and saying we expect the scene to be a little bit slower.  It's tough to speculate as to how long that 2% would be correct for, but it would be a little bit slower and then it'll start growing at the more normal rates.", "Overall though, Benefits is really a pretty stable business.  It might grow at four or five or might only grow at one or two, but it doesn't tend to be subject to the same big swing.", "Now the 2% growth rate that we gave you for next year is composed of a number of factors.  One is, we think the overall retirement business will continue to do pretty well in the US and the UK, which are our bigger markets, and maybe not quite as well in some of the smaller markets.  That's certainly what we've seen this year and it's what we would expect for next year.  ", "We have reasonably modest expectations, I think, for healthcare.  I feel pretty good about the assumptions we've made for healthcare.  I think if anything there's some upside there rather than some downside.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Speaking of the smaller countries where you don't expect results to be that good, at the time or slightly before the Towers' announcement, you guys were going through sort of a rationalization process, if you will, to try to see if you should stay in all these countries or withdraw or what you should do.  Is that process now on hold or are you still continuing along that path independently?", "John J. Haley", "Well, I think, Ashwin, we're always looking at the overall geographic location and where we should be and where we can most add value, and we approach that both from the viewpoint of are there places we need to get bigger and we need to make sure we have very strong operations in?  It was one of the reasons for the Bronze deal back in 2007 as well as the Heissmann deal.  We also looked at \u2014 you may remember several years ago we decided to exit the business in New Zealand because we didn't think it fit our overall geographic footprint. ", "So we continue to look at those things and to assess them, but when we make those decisions, we try to do it in the context of what the long-term strategy is and not of what's happening in a particular year.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Right.  If I can squeeze one more in on the expense side, as I look at the margin performance this quarter, obviously a good performance there, but the contributors to that good performance seem to be some combination of low variable comp and sharp decline in the use of subcontractors, neither of which in the long term seems particularly sustainable.  So can you comment on that, what is going on, first of all, and have you changed your stance with regards to your prior statement that maybe fiscal 2008 margins were at an unsustainable level and maybe fiscal 2007 was a better level?", "John J. Haley", "Yeah.  Well, I'll let Roger talk about the contractors.  Let me mention about the variable comp.  Our variable comp does go up or down as the business performs better or worse.  For the overall fiscal 2009, we had quite a good variable comp bonus pool, which we just announced to our associates this year.  As we look into FY10 we expect the results to be a little more challenging in FY10, and if we did, our variable comp bonus pool wouldn't be quite as good as it was this year and so we've taken that into account in the projections we've given you.  Roger, do you want to address the subcontractors?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah.  And maybe I'll comment more broadly on the margin question.  First, you also have to consider that there's the $0.07 of severance in there, so I think you have got the bonus effect, but a good portion of that is offset by severance, and margin still would have been up this last year on that net basis.", "But second, broadly, we're focused on cost control in all discretionary areas, and we're confident in our ability to manage and visibility into the expense load to manage ourselves to flat margins, and we've been very focused on that over the past several months.", "I think in general, about contractors, I mean, there are a couple things in there I know of specifically.  One is, some of that's related to project consultancy support that we've gotten that was one of the actions that we took as we pulled back on cost.  The other area contributing to that is just related to client expense pass throughs that are also down along with other areas this quarter. ", "But again, I want to emphasize the broader theme, that we are managing our expenses and you'll see reductions across the board, and we are seeing reductions across the board.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Robert W. Baird.  Please proceed with your question.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "", "Good morning.  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit, and I know we have the S4 coming out later on this month, but is there anything in terms of your discussions that you've seen thus far with Towers that would lead you to believe that the dilution expense or the dilutive aspects of the merger may be different than what you previously announced?  Or is there anything that you've seen thus far that would lead you to change anything that you've said back in June?", "John J. Haley", "Well, I think we don't have any new financial information, as Roger said, from what we had in June to today.  I mean we've been focused on getting our own financial results together to be able to do this call.  Towers is working on theirs now, but we haven't see anything so we really don't have anything new to tell you on that.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay.  But so far you haven't seen anything that seems materially different than what you were thinking previously?  ", "John J. Haley", "No.  And I think the reason I would say this is because we haven't really seen anything different.  We just don't have any new financial information at all.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay.  And then can you talk a little bit about the reception?  I know you've gone out and you've done meetings together; what's the overall tone in terms of how people are going to get together, the herbivores and the carnivores, et cetera?", "John J. Haley", "(Laughs) I think it's been terrific.  Mark and I went out over a period of \u2014 we did the announcement the first week.  I guess that was June 29th, and then it was up to the beginning of July and it was the week after that we started out and we did three different \u2014 for three weeks we went out and visited a number of our locations.", "And the first week or so I think people were still somewhat surprised and a little bit in shock at the announcement, but everybody got the strategic rationale, and as people started having a chance to think about it and process it, there's a great deal of enthusiasm and excitement about the possibilities.", "And I think Mark and I started out with our own enthusiasm and excitement about it, but we sort of got energized by the reception we were getting from our associates, too, and I think it's everything we could have asked for.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Great.   And it sounds like the leadership teams for the various practices will be announced fairly shortly?", "John J. Haley", "Well, we've announced, for the most part, all the direct reports of Mark and myself.  We have a group working diligently on a plan for how we're going to do leadership selection and we would like to make those decisions as soon as possible, but we also want to make sure we take the time to make the right decisions, and we're constantly working on that right now.  So I can't really give you a timetable for that, but our preference is to do it sooner, but also to make sure we get things right.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay.  And can you talk a little bit about PCIC and how you expect that to be impacted by the deal?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, John may have some more depth, but from an accounting point of view, again, PCIC will be consolidated in the acquisition and as a result of that consolidation we need to look at the reserving for E&O across the board for the new company and come up with the methodology for the new company.  And part of the S4 discussion will be around what we think that will look like.  So we're working on that now and shortly you'll have more color on that.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Can you just mention \u2014 we're basically going from four to three now, right, in terms of partners?  Or is it three to two?", "John J. Haley", "It is three to two.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "So when we do that, is the other player still committed?", "Roger F. Millay", "So I think in terms of the structure going forward, that's something that the teams are still working on, the actual business structure.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, all right.  And can you \u2014 the last question for now, can you just talk a little bit about the cash flows for this coming quarter?  What do you expect to pay out in terms of the severance charges as well as the bonuses that you've accrued for fiscal '09?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah.  The severance charge is probably about $2.5 million or so \u2014 it's a good portion of the $4 million that I mentioned for the year, and the bonus payout is going to be between $165-$170 million.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, great.  I'm going to jump off and jump back on.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.  Please proceed with your question.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Hi, guys.  Thank you very much for taking my questions.  I wanted to follow along the line of questioning that Ashwin was asking on the discretionary bonus compensation.  If I just go through the individual business units in the quarter, it seems like you guys really flexed the discretionary bonus comp, and that's one of the strengths in the model where you're able to really move that comp up and down.  Could you give us the absolute number of bonus comp in the quarter?", "John J. Haley", "I think you have that in the press release, and it's $23 million.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.  If it was, I didn't see it.  I'm sorry.  And then just along that line of reasoning, given what's going on with the merger \u2014 and I know there's competitor interest in seeing that there's going to be some dislocation amongst the employees because of this merger \u2014 do you still see the ability to flex the bonus compensation over the next year in the same way that you've been able to in the past, or do you really think that you're going to have to be more mindful of retention?", "John J. Haley", "Well actually, we have essentially a pay-for-performance model where our associates can expect to do a lot better when we do well and they expect to do less well when the business does less well, and we've followed that in the past.  That's been something we followed consistently up and down.", "I think when we look at the bonuses we're paying out for FY 2009, I would say they are very competitive in the marketplace, and given the performance that we expect to see over the next year or so, we expect again to be very competitive in the marketplace.", "The theory of this is we need to make sure we have a fair return to our investors, but we also need to make sure we reward our people, because if we don't reward our people right then we don't have a business.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "I agree.  I want to take a different track just in terms of the Human Capital Group, I want to understand your comments a little bit better.  Are you saying that you're noticing a little bit of an uptake in demand towards the end of the quarter?  Is that right way to look at it?", "John J. Haley", "Yes.  We are seeing some interest in potential projects.  Now, I wouldn't want to read too much into that, but it is a bit of a \u2014 what do they call those, green shoots or something?  I think it's a bit of a hopeful sign.  ", "As Roger and I have said over the last couple of quarters, our commitment is to try, in calendar 2010, to get the Human Capital business to at least break even, and we're going to do that and that's our focus.  Whether that occurs in this next quarter or whether it's delayed until the quarter after that we'll have to see, but we're committed on getting it to break even.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Which areas of Human Capital were you seeing the sign of the light?", "John J. Haley", "Well, compensation is the biggest part of our Human Capital business.  It's about two-thirds of it, so that's where we'd obviously see the most interest.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.  And then just going back to the PCIC question, is the PCIC affiliate project the affiliate income that we're seeing below the line?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah.  That's most of it.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.  So how should we think about that going forward?  Normally we've been sort of led to believe to expect just nothing in that line because there's so much variability, but there's got to be some profitability there.  Do you have any thoughts about that going forward?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah. I think my reaction to that is I'd hesitate at this point to give expectations because again, we've got to decide on what the structure going forward \u2014 and I presume you're referring to after the deal, right, and what happened?", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yeah, when you consolidated.", "Roger F. Millay", "Right.  We have to decide what the structure is going to be because obviously that's going to have an impact on what the results are and the conclusion on the E&O reserving policy; again, from an E&O point of view, you've really got to look through now what's happening in the two companies and come up with what it's going to look like on a consolidated basis, and that's one of the things we're looking at in the S4.  So again, you'll see more when we file.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "And then I'm going to squeeze in one last one.  Just before the merger, are you guys in your EPS guidance anticipating profitability there?", "John J. Haley", "I'm sorry, profitability where?", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "", "From that affiliate income.", "Roger F. Millay", "I think modest profitability \u2014 $1-$2 million.  There are some other things in there like our venture in Dubai and South Africa, but again, the big piece of this year was PCIC.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "So you think $1-$2 million a quarter?", "Roger F. Millay", "For the year.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Oh, for the year.  Okay.  Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Timothy McHugh with William Blair & Co. Please proceed with your question.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co.", "", "Yes.  I wanted to ask about potential positives and negatives from regulatory changes that are being discussed.  Obviously, the healthcare reform and the potential opportunities it could create for your healthcare in the (inaudible) segment.  And then I understand there's a bill in the House that includes some restrictions on compensation consultants and the independents. Can you talk at all, if you've looked at that, if that would or would not have any impact on your business?", "John J. Haley", "Yeah.  So I think on the healthcare we'll have to see what happens.  Any changes, if there's healthcare legislation that continues to use the employer-based system in the country and that introduces some changes to that, that's probably positive for us because we consult with the employers on that and basically as things change, as legislation or regulation changes things, then they will turn to us for advice.", "I think how much that might change things or how much of a boost that could give is hard to say, and it probably depends on exactly what form the legislation takes.  I think the only kind of legislation that would be really bad for us if either you went to a single-payer national health insurance, which would basically take away a lot of our consulting, but that's not something that we see coming down.", "Now on the exec comp legislation, there I guess both the House and the Senate have drafted similar legislation there.  And it requires a nonbinding shareholder vote on executive comp and independent compensation committee members, independent compensation consultants, and some enhanced disclosure.  ", "Basically, we think that it's probably a little early there too to say that will happen.  We think that the market opportunity for compensation consultants in general will probably increase from the passage of the legislation.  That is a question for us of how much share do we get.  I think one of the things that \u2014 a sensible approach to sort of compensation consultant independence, I think overall would probably be helpful for us, and we'd like to see the legislation or the regulators address that.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co.", "Okay.  So in general, you wouldn't not be conflicted out of a lot of them from other consulting services?", "John J. Haley", "Well, I mean, I think that gets to a question of what you might think is a sensible approach or not.  I think if somebody came in and were to say if you did any work for one company you couldn't work on their compensation consulting, obviously that would be bad for us.", "If they were to say that the issue is not so much whether you do any more work, but what size the relationship is overall, I think that would be something that would probably be helpful for us. I mean, I think if you're a small company that does only compensation consulting and you have 5% or 10% of your revenue comes from a single client, you've got an issue about maybe the objectivity with which you give advice to them, even if you don't do any non-compensation work.  The fact that we may do 1/2% of our revenue for somebody on non-compensation work shouldn't seem to be an issue compared to the other. ", "So it's a question of whether I think they can get a sensible view of what objectivity and independence is.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co.", "Okay.  And then, Roger, can you give us the severance expense from the fourth quarter \u2014 was that primarily in human capital or did that flow across a couple of different segments?  Can you give any detail on that?", "Roger F. Millay", "It was a mix, and I think it's HCG \u2014 I actually only have the annual numbers here, but there was a mix of benefits and HCG, I think, when you look at annually the biggest pieces in some like the communications practice and the kind of admin-type functions.  So things that would be in the other line for us.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co.", "Okay.  And then somewhat up a little bit on that is the margin guidance for Insurance and Financial Services for next year is obviously nicely improved from what you just did in the quarter.  What does that reflect?  It doesn't sound like you're assuming any significant change in the demand environment for that.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah. I mean, we remarked a little bit in the initial remarks that that's more of a project related business, which makes it a little more unpredictable.  That is a business that's very attentive to what does the pipeline look like and what are the costs related to that, and I think has been actually over the year because they had a tough '08 and then a big surge in business in '09, and they've been constantly kind of looking at do we have the right cost levels relative to what the pipeline looks like.  So I think they're ready to do that in fiscal year '10, and we want them to be on that low double-digit margin level, which as you say is up versus fiscal '08, but we're going to be very attentive to that and what the project pipeline looks like.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co.", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Fones with UBS.  Please proceed with your question.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "", "Yes, thanks.  Actually, Tim asked most of what I was going to ask, but I just wanted to followup on whether there was any merger related costs in the fourth quarter?  Thanks.", "John J. Haley", "No.  As I said, really, the merger-related costs in the first quarter are related to the change in accounting which through our fiscal year of '09 we were able to defer recognition of those costs, and moving now into the new fiscal year under the new accounting standard we have to expense them.", "Roger F. Millay", "They had been put on the balance sheet.", "Andrew Fones - UBS", "Okay, thanks.  That's all I had.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird.  Please proceed with your question.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "", "A couple of quick questions. One, can you talk a little bit about the Investing Consulting business?  I mean, the areas where you saw the pickup, what specifically drove that and how do you think that that's going to proceed?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, I mean, again, first, I have to say as a newcomer to the company this year, I have to say I've been really impressed with how the investment consulting guys have managed through this very difficult market, and so we were really pleased with the fourth quarter, and 14% constant currency growth \u2014 we were really pleased to see \u2014 if you follow back, I think, from the December quarter through the June quarter, there was a gradual kind of reopening up of our work, and now, as we said, it's spread pretty much across most of their business areas and we look forward to that continuing into fiscal '10, and it's great to have that kind of a business in these times that's close to a double-digit growth business projected for the year.", "John J. Haley", "And just to followup, the source of the growth was really in two areas.  One is the implemented consulting activities, which is really where we take over a lot more of the investment operation for organizations and we've had a couple of expanded client relationships where we've done that.  The other is an increase in strategy projects.  A lot of funds \u2014 I mentioned this in my remarks, are evaluating their investment strategy and risk tolerance.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay.  And it sounds like some of the tools that you were using previously on the implementation side that were frozen and you couldn't use \u2014 maybe some of those have opened up a little bit?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah.  Even those \u2014 you're talking about the risk projects, and again, that's kind of to the theme of what I said earlier.  Even those areas have become regenerated and we're starting to see growth there.  I mean, we're again pretty much in everything that they've done, maybe not at the robust levels of two years ago and even a year ago, I suppose, but we're seeing thawing in all of the areas that were difficult earlier in the year.", "John J. Haley", "Yeah, but I don't think structured products was one of the ones that we saw as the growth areas.  They really were from the implemented consulting and the strategy projects.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "", "Okay, and then can you talk \u2014 a question about Towers.  Do they have any tapped partly or multi employer plans on the DB side?", "John J. Haley", "I think they have very, very few, if any.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Very few?", "John J. Haley", "Yeah.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, great.  Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator's Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar.  Please proceed with your question.  Ashwin, your line is open.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "", "Just a quick housekeeping question on the tax rate, should we expect the elevated level of tax rate that we saw in the fourth quarter to continue in the near term because of severance?", "John J. Haley", "No.  The reason for the elevated tax rate this quarter was really kind of year-end true ups that mostly related to the geographic allocation of income and the tax rates in those areas.  So the 34% rate that we've given guidance for the year is what we expect, again, excluding the impact of merger related costs that are not deductible.  So we anticipate more steadiness in the tax rate versus the fourth quarter.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Right, thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.  I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.", "John J. Haley", "Okay.  Thanks everyone very much for joining us, and we look forward to updating you after the next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference call.

Now I\u2019d like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Kerry Calaiaro, Director, Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Kerry Calaiaro", "Thank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call and webcast.

Welcome and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call. Here with me today are Pat Regan, Co-Chief Operating Officer and CFO, Grahame Millwater, President, and Don Bailey, CEO of North America.", "This is Pat Regan's last official conference call, earnings call, as you know who will be leaving on the 19th of February. I want to thank him for his great efforts in helping Willis and all of its fortunes and we wish you well in the future, Patrick.", "Patrick Regan", "Thank you, Joseph.", "Joseph Plumeri", "Stephen Wood, which has been announced, who is our Willis Group Controller has been named Interim CFO, as we continue our search and someone who knows our company very well and knows our business very well, and we feel very, very comfortable in working with Stephen going forward.", "Other members of our management team are here to answer any questions that you have after our remarks. Well, the best thing I could do is to say that 2009 was an amazing year as we tackled the number of external and internal challenges in the middle of a global recession and soft market environment we delivered.", "Adjusted earnings were diluted -- per diluted share from continuing operations was $2.67. Adjusted operating margin of 22%, 2% organic growth in commissions and fees and Shaping our Future initiative that has been going on now for a couple of years had a net benefit of approximately $60 million.", "We began a major integration of an acquisition that closed in the middle of the financial crisis with bridge financing, substantially completed the integration with North America\u2019s synergies, and cost savings of $205 million in 2009, an astonishing achievement.", "Earned improved stable outlook for Moody\u2019s and S&P and repaid bridge financing, pre-funded 2010 maturities at 7%, and strengthened the balance sheet debt to adjusted EBITDA is now down to 2.6 times, and completed the re-capitalization of Gras Savoye, remove Gras Savoye, put and used net proceeds for debt reduction.", "So all the boxes that needed to be checked at the beginning of the year from balance sheet readjustment to what we\u2019re going to do with Gras Savoye to the integration of HRH into Willis has all been checked off and that\u2019s why I started my comment by saying this was truly an amazing year.", "Now let me drill down into the story line a little bit if I may. In the fourth quarter, the adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.47 with a negative $0.3 from foreign currency in the quarter giving $0.50 excluding FX.", "We had 2% organic growth in commissions and fees with positive contribution from each segment. North American segment grew 1%, which included, I\u2019ll remind you HRH was the first quarter, if we included HRH in our report in our calculation as we closed the transaction a year ago, a sequential improvement from the third quarter of 2009.", "So we\u2019re really pleased with that accomplishment, the integration is over. We talked about the integration all last year being a distraction, the integration was completed; we started to concentrate on growth. Don will talk about that, and those were the results.", "National segment grew at 3% and the global segment grew 1%. In North America, I'm extremely pleased with the 1% growth in organic commissions and fees and significant margin expansion in the fourth quarter. With the integration of HRH substantially completed and renewed focus on top line growth, we generated a significant increase in the amount of new business in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago.", "HRH has been a great strategic fit and we have more than exceeded our synergy targets creating significant operating leverage as we continue to navigate the recession and the soft market environment.", "I want to, for the first time, turn the rest of the discussion of Willis in North America over to Donald Bailey, the CEO of North America to run you through, a bit more color and progress that we made in the last year because as I said we couldn't be more pleased with that effort and the accomplishments of Willis in North America. Don?", "Donald Bailey", " ", "Thank you, Joe. Good morning everybody. First, it's probably helpful for me to remind you the strategy for HRH and why we did the transaction. It brought us critical math in key regions in the United States. I can include in that list markets such as New York, Atlanta, California, Texas, Chicago, Boston and Florida. It also brought us some critical market share in key locations such as Amarillo, Gainesville, Appleton, Wisconsin, Columbus, Wichita, Richmond, Okalahoma City, Savannah, Georgia, and Bangor, Maine where I was last week with one of our great construction plants.", "All of this literally brings Willis closer to our clients than anybody. That proximity allows us to deliver even more value to our clients through the local model that we run, which is global resources delivered locally.", "This will also create a welcome diversity to our client portfolio. It bolstered our core middle market business and added critical mass in the large account space, employee benefits, small commercial and private clients.", "Finally on the strategy, we could have made many small acquisitions but we chose to do it all in one transaction and create a single unified team. That strategy is tougher in the short term no doubt, but clearly creates a better business for the client and shareholders in the long run.", "Let me offer you some comments now about the integration itself. Integration as Joe talked about was clearly the focus for 2009 and is now largely complete. With the aim of driving margin improvement of the business, our four main priorities during the integration process were expense reduction from synergies, retaining the producers and clients, implementing the integration plan and converting the contingent commissions.", "I can tell you today that we are succeeding and exceeding our expectations on all fronts, combined synergy and rightsizing savings of approximately $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and approximately $205 million in the full year of 2009. That\u2019s the year it doubled our original targets.", "We continue to identify additional savings opportunities and expect to maintain similar level of total synergies and savings in full year 2010. Our producer and client retention remain high. We've had limited loss of producers. Only about 3% of North America acquired revenues are tied to producers leaving. Client retention at around 91% for Willis North America in 2009, that\u2019s consistent with recent years and in the midst of integration that\u2019s not easily achieved.", "We've had good progress on all integration work streams. In the end, we've created a strong combined operation, the organizational structure and leadership is in place. All office and staff moves are completed. We had over 5,400 associates that were impacted by real estate moves. This is a very impressive achievement to get done in 2009. We have improved our business planning and processes as well throughout 2009.", "Finally on converting contingent commissions, over 90% have been converted or predicted [ph].", "Now let me address Q4 results in North America, the improvement in organic commissions and fee growth, the positive 1% in fourth quarter was driven by an increase in new business generation. We were up 17% over the fourth quarter of 2008 on new business, and while doing it maintained steady client retention rates.", "We felt a more pronounced rate headwind of negative 6% for the quarter, which is up from negative 4% in Q3. In the end, Q4's organic growth improvement was a result of realizing the benefit of a more rigorous new business strategy. That strategy included a renewed focus on pipelines and differentiation as well as retaining those producers by creating a fair compensation plan and creating an environment that facilitate the creation and delivery of value to our clients all over North America and the world.", "The operating margin in North America was 25.6% in fourth quarter 2009, which is up 670 basis points from 18.9% one year ago and was 23.7% for the year, up 830 basis points.", "With the integration substantially complete with HRH, we have laid a terrific foundation and are now focused on running a great business in North America.", "Let me turn things back over to Joe.", "Joseph Plumeri", "", "Thanks, Donald, and hopefully you could see why we are excited about the future of North America and why we are now on a growth mode doing business and not being distracted by the integration, which I think was done very well.", "Internationally, our international unit, organic growth and commissions in fees was 3% for the fourth quarter as it continues its record of impressive growth across many regions in the face of some slowing economic conditions.", "Excluding, U.K. and Ireland, the retail businesses, international grew 7% and the reason I say excluding Ireland and U.K., as you know they have been beset, especially Ireland with some economic woe, so if I take all of our businesses around the world excluding those, they grew an impressive 7%.", "We had impressive growth in both Latin America and Asia led by Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia and China. U.K. and Ireland retail declined 9% as they both faced some of the same economic challenges that we are seeing in the U.S.", "New business generation remains double digit, while absorbing a negative four-point rate impact. Productivity per FTE rose 4% from last year to 166,000 on a trailing 12-month basis.", "Now let me talk about our global businesses. The global business segment comprised of Global Specialties, Faber & Dumas, and reinsurance had 1% organic growth in commissions and fees in the quarter in the face of a four-point rate headwind.", "The positive growth in specs and reinsurance was muted by a decline in the more economic sensitive Faber & Dumas. Global Specialties, the revenue drivers, Marine, Aerospace, Financial Solutions and FINEX Financial and executive risk specialties.", "The rate environment continued the softness in a number of areas in Global Specialties, although stabilization in aerospace. Reinsurance had a solid single-digit growth in the quarter, primarily North America and specialties, and this growth was driven by exceptionally high new business generation.

The synergies that Don and this team have captured through the integration process to date have been remarkable, and this is without this platform in place.", "This new platform will help growing our synergies to the next level and the next stage of improvement in our North American results. Now, let me turn to driving and funding growth. In the past few quarters, we have commented that our renewed focus on driving revenue growth.", "We've also commented that much of this was focused initially outside North America given the huge integration effort that was underway there. However, in the last six months, our attention has shifted to include North America in this effort and we believe this is reflected in the fourth quarter organic revenue numbers.", "We believe this focus on growth is building in momentum, delivering benefit and continues to be essential in an environment that is still facing substantial economic and insurance market headwinds.", "In interest of time on this particular call, I'll not go to the -- all of the specifics of our growth program other than to say segmentation, the value proposition, disciplined sales and client management processes and a relentless focus on retention will continue to be the major themes globally.", "We are also continuing to be increasingly aggressive in our recruitment efforts and we continue to mobilize the organization to systematically identify and attract the best talent in the industry.", "And we refer the rightsizing effort throughout this call and its impact in 2009.

Throughout the year, we executed on the $205 million of synergies in North America, and as Don said and worth repeating, despite a very tough revenue environment, we've grown our operating margin in North America from 15% to nearly 24% in the full year of 2009.", "These together with the other rightsizing outside of the U.S enabled us to deliver a 3% reduction in organic SG&A expense while at the same time hiring new producers such as, we talked about this before the Carvill team in reinsurance, investing nearly $40 million in Shaping our Future and many other investments across the company.", "On an adjusted basis, salary and benefits for the year remained relatively flat at about 56% of revenues in '09 compared to a year ago.

We systematically managed our group headcount.", "We completed an in depth review of client facing versus non-client facing positions. We continue to have rigorous approval protocols.

Year-to-date on a pro forma basis discretionary costs are down almost 14% in 2008 with significant savings in TV, advertising costs, printing and a number of other areas.", "Just talking for a second on the financial headwinds we saw in 2009, many of those headwinds we\u2019re facing at this time of last year have now stabilized. So taken together, we expect investment income, pension expense, and interest expense to be relatively inline flat for 2010 compared to 2009.", "On foreign exchange, in absolute terms, foreign currency movements had a negative $0.03 absolute impact in earnings per share in the quarter. There is some gain on the dollar sterling offset by hedging. Obviously, compared to 2008, foreign exchange is a positive due to the foreign currency loss on the pension scheme assets last year.", "On discontinued ops, we sold Bliss & Glennon early in the year so obviously we stripped that out of the comparative revenue, there is obviously no impact on organic. On tax, reported income tax for the quarter was $32 million compared to $23 million for the comparable period a year ago.", "The effective underlying tax rate for the year was approximately 26% again the same as for 2008 full year revenue.

And therefore purely looking at the associates line, as I think we talked about before, we currently estimate the associates line will be approximately $10 million lower in 2010 compared to right now.", "Turning to capital management overall then. I'm obviously very pleased by our progress on capital management throughout 2009. As Joe mentioned we obtained an improved outlook to stable from both Moody's and Standard & Poors.", "That gave us a great path forward from which we launched our September bond issue for $300 million which we eventually priced at 7%. We use that to tender for what ended up in a $160 million of our 2010 bonds.", "We then apply the next proceeds in the Gras Savoye transaction together with operating cash flow we generated to reduce our term loan by a $180 million to $520 million at year end.", "These actions together significantly improved our debt maturity profile. Once that remaining $90 million of the 2010 bonds is paid, only the mandatory repayments, the only amount remains for next five years of the quarterly scheduled payments of $27 million a quarter on that $700 million five year term loan.", "Total debt therefore is now down to 2.37 billion, compared to 2.65 billion at the start of the year.

Our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations $2.67, organic growth and commissions and fees 2%, adjusted operating margin of 22%.", "We obviously had to check off the box called HRH integration, which I think substantially was completed and North America organic growth turned positive.", "The other box was to complete the reorganization of the capital of Gras Savoye, we did that and did that successfully and strengthened our balance sheet with debt adjusted EBITDA down to about 2.6 times well on our way to our target of 2.5 times when we will consider as I said in the past buybacks again.", "We remain very vigilant about our priorities while the external environment remains a challenging one. With continued slow global economies and the soft insurance market, will have to continue to do the following and I think we do the following very well. Improve and reinforce our sales and revenue culture to drive growth, further execute shaping our future, whatever things we have left to fully integrate HRH like putting in a system that will now be constant throughout all the offices in North America, whether it be legacy HRH or Willis will be completed, and continue to grow the top line of North America and of course maintain the expense management to fund growth.

Was there anything unusual in that, any reason why that wouldn\u2019t be sustainable going forward and to what extent did the compensation structure play into that?", "Joseph Plumeri", "", "I will answer that and then Don can offer his comments. As we said all year last year, the integrations of businesses, especially that large takes a lot of time. There is a lot of distraction. If you take that distraction, plus the soft market, plus the economy, it is just hard to do, but with the integration substantially out of the way, we talked about on the last call, that our full attention was to growing our business and as result of pipelines and as a result of everybody now concentrating on that subject you saw what the growth of new business could be and I actually think that -- with the way our pipelines are, it looks like it\u2019s a harbinger of things to come.", "Secondly, we took care of telling everybody what the pay-out would be very early in the game. We took care of all the guessing, people knew who was going, where all this is going to be merged together, we told people what their pay-out structure would be, we did that early in the game.", "So as a result, people\u2019s minds were fresh with the thought of actually doing business. So when I think you take all of those considerations, even despite the headwinds in the fourth quarter, I think what you saw was what we expected and hoped for which is very solid growth in North America.", "Don, you want to add anything to it?", "Donald Bailey", "I would reiterate, Mark, I guess the plan was pretty simple, but not simple to execute. It was as Joe said, keep the producers, there is no way we would have achieved 17% growth in new business in Q4 if we didn\u2019t keep the people. We put a good comp plan out, we did that early, now we gave them something to sell. So they felt like they had a good opportunity to deliver value to the client and then we put rigor around the pipelines and got very, very serious about accountability in new business.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "How about, just one follow-up, the reinsurance segment, what should we think about that in Q1 with kind of great dynamics recently?", "Joseph Plumeri", "Peter Hearn will answer that question, Peter?", "Peter Hearn", "Mark, rates obviously split in the first quarter, based on the one-one renewals anywhere from 5% to 10% depending on the segment, depending on the line of business, but again overall the delta between insurance and reinsurance results are still significant. There will be pressure on reinsurance rates in 2010.", "Operator", "Our next request from Keith Walsh - Citi.", "Keith Walsh - Citi", "First for Pat, just a clarification around organic growth, I just want to know, how are you accounting for the $50 million of HRH contingent commissions in the organic growth calculation, since they have been converted to regular commissions. So I just want to get some clarification around that.", "Patrick Regan", "Pretty simple on that one Keith. We still have a chunk of things that are still contingent in 2009 being converted as we go through 09 into 2010. To the extent things are commissions and fees and they've shown in commission and fees accordingly.", "The impact in Q4 of any of those \u201cconversions\u201d wouldn't be significant on the overall organic growth rate for North America.", "Joseph Plumeri", "As we said, Keith, that we were very successful in converting over 90% of the contingency fees. Most of that contingents you saw in the first quarter because we just began the process.", "But by the time we got to fourth quarter, if the underlying question is that, was there a lot of contingents in the fourth quarter that came from HRH which bolstered the growth in North America, the answer is no.", "There were very little contingents by the fourth quarter. Most of them you saw on the first quarter of last year, so there were very, very small contingents left. As I said, we converted 90 plus percent of them. So this was pure organic growth.", "Keith Walsh - Citi", "I guess the question what I'm getting at is the year-over-year comparison, if in 4Q '08, there was a lot of contingents in the way HRH choose to, they used\u2013 to conclude the contingents from their organic growth calculation and now these are regular commissions, are we doing an apples to apples comparison is what I'm trying to get at.", "Patrick Regan", "Yes, to answer your question specifically, there is not a big impact on what was MDI [ph] converting into our commission in fixed [ph].", "Keith Walsh - Citi", "For Joe, around compensation I think you touched on this a little bit, but just converting the HRH producers to the Willis compensation plan, when did that go into effect and is this is a source of upside for margin in 2010 as I think you\u2019ve articulated when the deal was first done and the HRH Plan was richer than the Willis plan?", "Joseph Plumeri", "We put it into effect January 1, so we announced what we were going to do, but early or mid year last year, but it became effective January 1.", "Keith Walsh - Citi", "If you can quantify maybe how this could potentially be a benefit to your margins in 2010?", "Joseph Plumeri", "", "I think it could be a benefit because I think we put more emphasis on growth and we reconfigure the compensation so that I think a, everybody was happy. I believe they were because you saw our attrition was rather low for deal of this size.", "And secondly, we reconfigured it so people got paid very well for growth and we started to see the ramifications of that, hopefully that will continue.", "Keith Walsh - Citi", "", "Just a follow up a little bit there, just assuming no growth, you got the same revenue year-over-year, the Willis plan versus HRH plan, which is better?", "Patrick Regan", "", "It\u2019s not as simple to say as what was X percentage now, Y percent. What Donald and team did was take the best of both plans, blend it into different price in different segments. So it isn\u2019t as simple as saying, it used to X percent and now it is Y percent thing. We do believe in the right areas it will drive better growth, but it\u2019s not a simple answer to say it will\u2026", "Joseph Plumeri", "", "It is true though Keith that if there is no growth in a producer\u2019s book they won\u2019t get paid for that growth for lack of growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "", "Joe or Don, the rate impact that you mentioned I believe down 5% or 6% in the fourth quarter?", "Donald Bailey", " ", "6%.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Down 6%?", "Donald Bailey", " ", "Yes.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "It's just a lot different from what we\u2019re hearing from some of the large primary commercial insurers, any thoughts in terms of what that disparity could be driven by?", "Joseph Plumeri", " ", "Well first of all, I think that's always the case. Just nothing unusual, you'll always hear carriers say that they\u2019re more disciplined and all those kind of stuff. All I can tell you is that we tracked this and have been tracking this for quite a long time, you've been covering us for a long time and the fact that remains is, it's a 6%. Don?", "Donald Bailey", "The only thing I would add, Jay, on it is, and what you'll see from a carriers typically is no contemplation of new business in their rate calculations, which are a significant piece of what happens out there. So if they are acquiring a piece of business at a lower rate than what it is going for at current, it's not going to be reflected in their numbers. So I think you'll see some of delta be reflected in that dynamic.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "That\u2019s a good point and then just the numbers point, the interest income was $15 million in the fourth quarter versus $10 million in the third, but you\u2019re saying it\u2019ll still be the same as it was for the full year around $50 million in 2009. Why is that?", "Patrick Regan", "We took the items together, you remember what I said was interest income, pensions and interest payable taken together will be flat versus 2009.

Part of it is two factors. One is obviously the interest rate prevailing at that time but also as we've talked about, we have a forward hedging program that kind of has provided us with a significant increment to that in the past. We have some of those contracts rolling into 2010, so I would expect net-net that we would get a little less than 50 million in 2010.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "And overall the anticipated impact or benefits from foreign exchange in 2010, what would that be?", "Patrick Regan", "", "Not expecting any significant impact one-way or the other in 2010 versus 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak & Co., Llc.", "Thomas Mitchell - Miller Tabak & Co., Llc.", "", "The two sort of offline sort of interest and earnings of associates and net income attributable to non controlling interest, after a number of transactions have been done, I'm wondering if there's some way you can give us guidance as to what we should use for those two figures on a regular basis quarter-by-quarter?", "Patrick Regan", " ", "Well, on the associates line, as I mentioned following the Gras Savoye transaction, we will be about $10 million lower on that line in 2010 versus 2009.

If you mean that we were able to get higher commissions from carriers than HRH had been able to get, the answer is yes, which is why in large part we have been able to eliminate the contingents.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "", "But, was there a difference beside that?", "Donald Bailey", "No, it\u2019s basically a much more focused plan that we had that addressed differences in the way we were paid by carriers on a branch-by-branch basis.

And as a result, we actually have almost completed 100% in a year that we said we would take three years to do, we have done it in a year, so you can check that box off. And secondly, we believe going forward, irrespective of what happens to contingents that we will be able to get paid our fair share of what we deserve, because we will not take contingents, if they are sunsetted in the future does not mean we don\u2019t expect to get paid.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "", "Now that Willis combined with HRH is a much bigger North American player does that itself mean that on the Legacy-Willis business there are higher commission rates possible?

Grow the top line, maintain our expense discipline, pay down more debt, buy stock back and hopefully we have as good year in 2010 as we did in 2009.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Do you know what free cash flow was during 2009?", "Donald Bailey", "It\u2019ll be obviously in the Q when that\u2019s published.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "The international operating margin down a little bit last couple of quarters, obviously U.K., Ireland currency, should we start to see that stabilize, what\u2019s the outlook there?", "Patrick Regan", "Yeah, don\u2019t read too much into that. The little bit of FX impacts, a couple of timing items in the fourth quarter and then obviously the U.K. and Ireland, but no, don\u2019t read too much into that as you look forward.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Well, will it stay stable, perhaps improve a little bit going forward?", "Patrick Regan", "Yes.", "Donald Bailey", "Yes, that\u2019s accurate.", "Operator", "Thank you. As I have no further requests, I\u2019d like to turn conference back to management.", "Patrick Regan", "Just a quick clarification, just to be crystal clear. The $205 million of integration and savings I referred to earlier, the same 205 that Don referred to earlier, was non incremental 205, just to be crystal clear on it.", "Kerry Calaiaro", "", "Any other questions?

I'll now turn the call over to Joe.", "Joe Plumeri", "Thank you Kerry and welcome everybody and good morning. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2010 earnings call. Here with me today are Stephen Wood, Group Controller and Interim CFO; Grahame Millwater, our President; Don Bailey, Chairman and CEO of North America; and Peter Hearn, who is responsible as you all know for our reinsurance business. So we\u2019re all here to answer your questions and the chime in, when you want us to.", "Let me talk about the first quarter and the conditions surrounding the first quarter. Obviously we\u2019re very pleased with the results we have delivered this quarter, especially given in the environment. The general economic conditions remain challenging in a number of countries in which we operate and then on top of that as you all know, the rate environment is still very soft, but against this background we delivered and that\u2019s what we\u2019re excited about.", "Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $1.27, adjusted operating margin of 32.2% was up 240 basis points over a year ago period, 3% organic growth in commissions and fees and this was driven by positive organic growth in each of our operating segments which is really exciting to us, Shaping Our Future, an ongoing program that\u2019s been going on for three years continued to yield net benefits of $14 million that was realized in the first quarter of 2010.", "And I\u2019ll only talk about our business segments, first North America, last year we continually talked about integration, updated you on how that was going, we\u2019re not going to do that anymore, that\u2019s done, dusted over. So let's talk about our business and really what\u2019s going on in North America. We had 1% organic growth where we delivered double-digit new business generation, supported by continuing high client and producer retention rates, which is very, very important. And these are two things that we concentrated on especially in North America, since the acquisition was made.", "We have a net due I think to intense personal engagement with producers by our local management, by our regional management, by Don Bailey and his staff and he\u2019s making on a great job. Combining this was a new producer package which we inaugurated on January 1, I think it makes all of those statistics possible. The rate headwind was a negative 3% for the quarter compared with the 6% negative in the fourth quarter. So the rates remain soft.", "The differentiation, I think within the mix of business, it\u2019s not that the business has gotten any harder or more stable. I think it\u2019s the mix of business, the mix of the differential between the two. Driving on a business growth in commissions and fees in general are our specialist businesses. We gained substantial client feedback from varied sources including client advisory councils, client surveys and interviews and we know from all of that that the client\u2019s demand from us that our product and segment expertise and our specialist segment expertise carry today.", "In the first quarter, high levels of growth were delivered in healthcare, financial institutions, personal lines and real estate hospitality. Bottom line, where we specialize is I said earlier we performed better and the whole lender pending [ph] of our growth that you\u2019ll hear later with regard to our growth strategy going forward is our specialization, understanding our client needs, understanding their industry and where we specialize and let them understand and be confident by the fact that we understand them, we win.", "We continue to successfully convert or protect the legacy HRH contingents, we noted that in the press release. In the first quarter of 2010, we had $8 million compared with $20 million in the first quarter of 2009. Let me just make a couple of points before I get off that subject with regard to contingent commissions, that they don\u2019t convert that differential of $12 million, they don\u2019t convert automatically in the first quarter, they convert overtime, over a period of the course of the year because it\u2019s not a portfolio basis.", "Secondly, they don\u2019t convert dollar-for-dollar, a lot of times businesses lost or there is other things that occur in that business and they have been converted in a declining rate environment. So it\u2019s not $12 million in the quarter, there are a lot of things that have jurisdiction over that $12 million and I thought I\u2019d take a second to make sure that that\u2019s understood.", "So at the end of the day, our organic revenue growth came from strong new business with high client retention and producer retention. US recession and high unemployment continue to weigh especially on construction and our employee benefit businesses which I thought I\u2019d mention because it is a big part of our business. The construction practice commissions and fees declined single digits in the first quarter. It is better than it was last year and they\u2019re improving from now double-digit decline in the full year \u201909 versus 2008 which is still in decline, now it\u2019s a single-digit decline. They\u2019re getting better.", "Employee benefit practice represents about 20% of North American revenues, commissions and fees were flat in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 2009 which I think in a declining headcount job rate environment that was a very impressive result because a lot of this has to do with the amount of employees that are covered by our clients. So I think very, very impressive considering them point of levels.", "Well I\u2019m on the subject of employee benefits, I should give you a little bit of color, share a few thoughts on healthcare reform which is not an easy thing to do, it\u2019s complicated and I\u2019m not going to read all 2,600 pages but I\u2019d give you our take on what healthcare reform is all about. Many of the final details of the legislation is yet to be determined and as such any definitive statement about its perspective impact on our business is difficult and it\u2019s probably premature, I\u2019ll take a few shots at it.", "The legislation will create more insureds that's good for us. It will create more regulatory complexity and that\u2019s certainly good for us. It will create incentives for cost management that will place the premium on world-class program, design and placement and that\u2019s good for us and it will increase employer costs that will create the need to find high value, provide a broker that give them really intelligent consultation and that\u2019s good for us. While the practical implications of medical loss ratios in state based exchanges are I think still will to be determined too early. Willis is \u2013 I think we\u2019re well positioned to deliver what we believe clients will need.", "Brokers with key structuring and transaction skills which we have along with broad consulting capabilities, I think will do well on the future environment. At Willis, we have all under one roof, we got all those capabilities, all the resources and we\u2019re excited about the future as the economy recovers as more people are put to work, as more questions are answered, as more help is needed by our clients, we think that\u2019s good. And then lastly I\u2019ll tell you that our operating margin in North America expanded to 21.5% in the first quarter of 2010, up 60 basis points from a year ago, reflecting organic commissions and fee growth combined with ongoing cost management, just a terrific job in North America.", "Let me talk a little bit about the international. The organic growth in commissions and fees continues to be good. It was 3% for the first quarter and continued its record of impressive growth across many regions in the phase of some slowing economic conditions which you are familiar with especially in some of the countries in Europe. Outside the UK and Ireland international grew 5%. So if you take out Ireland and its economic growth and if you take out the UK international grew 5%.", "We had strong growth in Latin America let by Venezuela and Brazil. Asia let by Indonesia and China and Eastern Europe led by Russia while commonly Europe faces a more challenging economic environment as I said earlier resulting in lower growth levels. UK and Ireland retail are improving, but still declined 3% as they continue to face the economic challenges. We\u2019ve seen some signs though of an improving economy in UK with positive GDP growth, while the Irish economy is showing signs it might have bottomed out, so that\u2019s good.", "Employee benefit practices which represented about 10% of international commissions and fees continues to perform well growing in mid-single digits. New business generation remains double-digit while absorbing a negative one point rate impact and then finally, international operating margins remained seasonally high at 33.9%. Now let me turn to global, the segment comprised of reinsurance just to remind you, Reinsurance, Global specialties, Faber & Dumas, Willis Capital Markets and Advisory had a 7% organic growth in commissions and fees in the quarter and in the phase of a two point rate headwind. Despite the continued softness in the market, each business delivered positive growth primarily driven by our reinsurance operation which continues to deliver.", "Reinsurance had a high single-digit growth in the quarter. Growth was driven by strong new business generation in North America and strong growth in Europe and Asia. As a result of strong reinsurance underwriting process in 2009, this is general but disciplined softening of rates which continues to be a significant headwind. Insured losses not yet sufficient to change pricing but despite record loss activity in quarter one, it was the largest first quarter cat loss in history in the first quarter.", "Global specialties are \u2013 revenues were the drivers, the financial and executive risk specialties and marine, strong business in a difficult environment, headwinds continue and include industry consolidation, depressed world trade and soft rates. Faber & Dumas our London based wholesale business also recorded positive organic growth driven by new business generation. Willis Capital Markets, all I can say is we\u2019re happy with the early successes of Willis Capital Markets. It\u2019s a very fledgeling business but we\u2019re very, very hopeful and optimistic of what\u2019s going to happen throughout the year and our global operating margin after having said all that was a seasonally high 45.5% in the first quarter.", "So with all that as a backdrop let me turn it over to Grahame Millwater, who is going to talk to you about growth Shaping Our Future and funding growth as we go forward. Grahame?", "Grahame Millwater", "", "Thank you, Joe. We continued to drive our program with change and continual improvement across all the businesses and see the benefits from these programs reflected in our quarter results. Just to remind you the program focuses on three key areas. The organic growth program that is driving our revenue increase, Shaping Our Future which is driving our efficiency and profitability and funding growth which is the program managing our underlying expense base on a day-to-day basis.", "Let me give you a brief update on progress report on all of these. Firstly growth, we\u2019re now entering our second year of the growth program. We commenced at the beginning of 2009 and we initially focused on our international and global businesses and then our North American business in the second half of 2009 as we came out of the integration process. The growth program has the following key elements to it. First in driving the retention and new business metrics across every business unit with very define targets and those targets linked to our global incentives.", "Secondly, increasing the productivity and effectiveness of our revenue generating associates and a major drive to recruit the best talents in the industry. Thirdly, continued development of our proposition in our key segments for global large accounts middle market and small commercial, and that combined with a real focus as Joe said earlier on our specialty skills and our industry segments. Also we\u2019re focusing on real breakout growth segments such as China, Brazil where employee benefits facultative, reinsurance, Willis Capital Markets, etcetera. And in the first quarter of 2009, we had nine large meetings across the world, where we really engaged with a 1000 of our business leaders on the subjects of new business growth retention, business planning and targeting.", "I have to say the optimism and excitement was so obvious at these meetings and just confirms the opportunity that we have in front of us as a group. The impact of all these initiatives has evidence in our sector leading organic revenue growth and it\u2019s also very pleased to see our efforts in North America gaining traction. Now let me turn to Shaping Our Future. One of the questions we often get is whether our margin and our margin improvement is sustainable. One of the drivers of this not just been our day-to-day expense management, but our longer term program of change to our infrastructure program, processes and optimal use of locations such as our offshore center in Mumbai.", "The momentum in this program that core Shaping Our Future continues and we will continue to drive benefits from this program over the coming years. We met the three year target we set ourselves at the beginning of 2008, within two years. Just to remind you this was to deliver cumulative additional net benefit to our bottom line of $100 million. Despite having met this target early we continued to drive the program and the associated benefits and in the first quarter of 2010 we delivered further additional growth benefits of $23 million with net margin benefits of $14 million.", "The key drivers of these benefits in the past couple of years has been our focus on client profitability and enhanced new original commissions. However we\u2019re now entering next interesting phase of Shaping Our Future where we start to drive real increase benefit from our longer term program with technology impressive change. Once we continue to manage our expenses on a day-to-day our efficiency gains going forward will largely derive from the infrastructure programs within Shaping Our Future.", "We have three major large programs of technology impressive change in London, UK retail and now the ethic program in North America. And this will be extended into international retail in 2011. We also continued to roll out our program of location optimization with work being moved out of the branch offices to our regional service centers and then from the regional service centers to offshore in Mumbai and we\u2019re now also in the process of identifying low cost service center location in Europe and Latin America, a non-English language related servicing requirements.", "It is this combination of technology platform enhancement, key process change and optimal use of our service and support centers that really allows us to continue to drive cost efficiencies and increase service performance even as our revenues increase in line with our growth plans. And as I\u2018ve already said this plan allows us to believe that we continue to improve our margins over time.", "Now let me turn to funding growth, the third of our major programs and we\u2019re driving a funding growth program in 2010. As you know we achieved significant HRH synergies and rightsizing with us such savings in 2009. And generally speaking our major focus has shifted from integration to driving organic growth and building a platform build over the longer term efficiency gain. However, in 2010 we\u2019ve identified further internal expense savings that come from just our performance management program and identifying other corporate expense improvements and we\u2019re in the process of executing on those savings. This program will help us fund the investment we\u2019re making in 2010 on these productive recruits and the further investments in our technology program.", "Just a quick overview of where we are on these initiatives. Needless to say the accumulated effect of these has allowed us to yet another quarter of positive organic revenue growth and operating margins improvement. And with that I would turn the call over to Stephen Wood, our Group Controller and Interim CFO to review the financial results, Stephen.", "Stephen Wood", "", "Thank you Grahame and good morning or good afternoon everybody. Earnings, reported earnings for continuing operations in the first quarter were $204 million or a $1.20 per share. Reported earnings were impacted by nontaxable one time charge of $12 million or $0.07 per share. This relates to the Venezuelan currency devaluation. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2010 excluding the Venezuelan revaluation with $216 or $1.27 per share.", "Other foreign currency movements positively impacted earnings per share by $0.06 in the first quarter of 2010. Let me now turn over operating margin. Reported operating margin was 31%. This was negatively impacted by the one-time charge related to the Venezuelan devaluation. Excluding the impacts of the devaluation adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 32.2%, up 240 basis points from 29.8% in the year ago quarter.", "The first quarter of 2010, adjusted operating margin was impacted by solid growth in commission and fees, lower investment income as global interest rates remained low, lower pension, severance and amortization cost and favorable operational FX. Let me give you some more details now on the expense. Reported salaries and benefits were $486 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $480 million in the first quarter of 2009. Salaries and benefits were 50% up total revenue in the first quarter of 2010 compared with 51.6% in the year ago period.", "As reported in the press release we have a cash retention program in place. We started awarding retentions in 2005 for a small number of people. With the success of the retention program we expanded it over time to include more staff on an employee turn of half decline. Given the increase prominence of that program we believe that is appropriate to give additional color. In the first quarter 2010, cash retention awards of $169 were paid with amortization currently over three years, starting from the beginning of the quarter in which is the payment is paid.", "Salary and benefits includes $28 million of expenses relating to the amortization of cash retention awards compared to $18 million of expenses in 2009. Salaries and benefits do not reflect the unamortized portion of annual cash retention awards. At the end of the first quarter of 2010 the balance sheet held $233 million unamortized retention awards in other assets, $98 million as of December 31, 2009 and a $127 million as of March 31, 2009. Reported other operating expenses were $149 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with a $138 million in the first quarter of 2009.", "We will continue to maintain the strict expense control protocols we had in place throughout 2009. Operational Foreign Exchange, operational foreign exchange is a positive impact on a Q1 2010 adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating margin compared to the quarter a year ago Q1 2009. The Euro appreciated positively impacting results due to overweight of Euro revenues. And the Pound appreciated against the dollar negatively impacting expenses due to overweight of Sterling expenses. However the impact of this was broadly offset by our hedging program.", "Let me move to tax items, reported income taxes, income tax expense for the quarter was $67 million compared to $62 million expense for the comparable period a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 was 26%, after adjusting for the net effect of 13 items. The underlying effective tax rate for the quarter on the March 31 2010 remains at 26%. The same underlying effective tax rate for the full year 2009. Associates, income from associates was $20 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $26 million in the year ago quarter. This line is reported net of interest from (inaudible) in the Gras Savoye we completed last year.", "We currently estimate that the reduction ownership of Gras Savoye will reduce the associate line by approximately $10 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Pensions, like others our defined pension plans continued to impact our income statement, balance sheet and cash flow. Our main plans were in the UK, US with several smaller plans in international. The scheme had a combined deficit of around $120 million at the end of 2009. That deficit was approximately $80 million at the end of the first quarter 2010.", "We expect to make total contributions to the firm of approximately $125 million in 2010. We currently estimate pension expense in 2010 to be approximately $40 million. Debt and capital management, total debt at the end of the first quarter is now $2.4 billion compared with $2.37 billion as at December 31, 2009. As we typically do it this time of year, the revolver was drawn from normal seasonal usage to tune up of about $65 million. As you know we paid bonus and cash retention awards in the first quarter and the revolvers on paid back over the subsequent quarters.", "We also had a mandatory term loan repayment in the quarter of $27 million. Debt reduction remains our priority. Looking at the rest of the year, we have mandatory term loan repayments of $27 million per quarter and a final bond maturity payments of $83 million in July. Cash and cash equivalents was a $196 million as at March 31, 2010.", "With that I will now turn the call back to Joe.", "Joe Plumeri", "Thank you very much Stephen. Before I give you some concluding comments, I just wanted to give you an update our CFO search. The process is moving along very, very well. It\u2019s a very, very important position, so we\u2019re not rushing it. Shortlist very strong candidates across the board and we hope we\u2019ll make a decision soon so you\u2019ll be hearing that about that I think very soon. So let me just summarize, what I think are our key events.", "Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $1.27, adjusted operating margin of 32.2% and 3% organic growth in commissions were positive, organic growth in each segment which as I said before is outstanding. So reiterate the priorities, many of what which you\u2019ve heard over the course of this presentation. Reinforce our sales and revenue culture to drive growth, high growth in new business and high retention rates, further execute Shaping Our Future, that\u2019s going go on for a long, long time it\u2019s part of the culture of this company, maintain \u2013 continue to maintain as we have for years. Disciplined expense management to fund that growth and also to be able to fund the difficult environment we\u2019re in and to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and continue to get to the point where we get the debt-to-EBITDA down to the levels that we mentioned earlier.", "I think all of these efforts have and will continue to position us very, very well for success and I\u2019ll turn this over to the moderator, who will ask you if you got any questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "At this time, we\u2019re ready to go to question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) One moment for the first question please. Keith Walsh from Citi. You may ask you question.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Hey Good morning everybody.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Hi Keith, how are you doing?", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Good. How are you Joe?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Good to see you the other night.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Yes, same here. I guess first question the same one I have been asking I guess for the last four quarters in a row. The contingent you tell us it goes from 20 to 8, I'm assuming the other 12 I mean, you alluded to this a little bit maybe it\u2019s less converted to regular commissions, is this number is or is that $12 million or $10 million whatever it is included in your organic growth rate of 1% in North America?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "No. It is not, I mean you \u2013 it\u2019s something you and I\u2019ve been talking about for a while and it\u2019s just the suggestion is that the 12 is converted in one quarter, it is not. Its converted over a period of time and when it\u2019s not converted on a dollar-for-dollar basis there is lost accounts in there, there is different kinds of treatments as it relates to the way about stuff flows through so that when you take all of that stuff in the account first declining rates the $12 million is almost de minimis, it's almost nothing there.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Okay. So just to be clear here, you had $20 million of contingents, now it\u2019s only 8. There is the gap in between there and you\u2019re telling me that gap is nothing?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "A gap of $12 million which appears to be in your particular case and I could appreciate that that suggest that when you take that away from we\u2019re in a growth number that we\u2019re not really growing 1%, to simply a difference of miscalculation in the way you look at it. The $12 million is not converted in one quarter Keith, the $12 million is not, its spread out throughout the year, so that gives you a very small percentage in the quarter, secondly it\u2019s not done on a quarter \u2013 on a dollar-for-dollar basis. There are declining rates that are also included in there and there is also included in that calculation lost accounts that we\u2019ll never see again and as a result of that when you include all of those factors, it\u2019s de minimis.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Okay, so basically you\u2019re saying that $12 million is an immaterial number and that 1% organic is more representative of your true organic growth even if I stripped out both of the interest.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Yes, and another thing I would say on top of that whatever the number is that is converted into the upfront commissions which we\u2019ve done over the last year and a half are work that we have to do to convert them from contingents to upfront commissions. So if you do all of that whatever is left and I think it\u2019s small, it\u2019s not a great percentage of the converted contingents it\u2019s still upfront commissions which we had to work to generate. So when you put all those things together I don\u2019t see that that had a grave effect upon our organic growth.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Okay, and then just moving on to Peter, looking at the strength in global I'm assuming a lot of that\u2019s coming from reinsurance. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about the strength there between maybe, buckets of price, carrier retention and maybe share gains from some of your larger competitors?", "Peter Hearn", "", "Yes, I think it\u2019s a combination of all three Keith we\u2019ve had in place in reinsurance a very strong sales, just went for a number of years starting to manifest itself in all of our businesses. We\u2019ve still benefit from the purchase of R.K. Carvill last year on top of the strong North American growth we had but it\u2019s a function of high client retention which is always been a hallmark of Willis Re, strong sales discipline and yes some fall out some of our competitors.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Okay and then just if I could sneak one last on Steve and just on the pension expense, I think you said the GAAP expense of $40 million in 2010. If you could just remind us what it was in 2009?", "Stephen Wood", "", "In \u201909 it was, just a second, I\u2019m just looking, $43 million.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Thanks Keith.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Jack Sherck with SunTrust.", "Jack Sherck \u2013 SunTrust", "", "Hi, thank you very much. Just a question about the rate headwind in the US, you mentioned it was down 3% versus down 6% in 4Q and it was due to a change in the mix of business rather than a change in the market. I just wanted to know if I\u2019m interpreting that correctly was it more strength did you saw in healthcare, financial, personal lines and real estate, did you know what that was?", "Joe Plumeri", "", " I\u2019ll let Don to answer that question.", "Don Bailey", "", "And the answer would generally yes, so the point that Joe was trying to make is that we\u2019re not suggesting that there is some demonstrable demands trend in the marketplace where rates are getting better. It\u2019s not the case at all. What you\u2019re seeing is more different products that represent our mix of business in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, that\u2019s all.", "Joe Plumeri", "", " It\u2019s a question of sector strengthening, some lines getting better than other lines but so when you look at say rates seem to be getting better, that\u2019s not case, that\u2019s why I mentioned it\u2019s more of a mix of the type of business and the lines of business rather than it is a broad book that\u2019s going from six to three.", "Jack Sherck \u2013 SunTrust", "", "Right, and then you mentioned that in North America employee benefits is about 20%. What is that construction now?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "How much percentage of our business is construction?", "Jack Sherck \u2013 SunTrust", "", "Exactly.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "In North America, it's 10%.", "Jack Sherck \u2013 SunTrust", "", "10%. And then just my final question is on the 2% rate headwind that you mentioned in global. What was that last quarter, do you remember?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "What was that last quarter? It\u2019s about 2%.", "Jack Sherck \u2013 SunTrust", "", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Keith Alexander with JPMC.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMC", "", "Hi good morning.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Hi good morning.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMC", "", "Hi, I was wondering do you expect growth persists in global and international for the rest of 2010.And if not what kind of macro environment is needed to keep it positive?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Well we certainly hope so, I can't make any predictions the economy there as you know is very inconsistent especially in the so called PIGS countries. But I will tell you that the PIGS countries just represent 15% of our revenue in international, but they\u2019re good countries, Spain and Italy especially are very big countries for us but the total is only 15%. So there is a lot of inconsistency, you got Ireland, still not getting to positive GDP but getting better, the UK is positive GDP and that\u2019s getting better. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in Europe. We could get more strength in obviously Germany and France but then you got the Spain and Italy thing but I think when everything is certainly done and of course our Asian operations and South America \u2013 Latin America have done very, very well.", "So when you put all that together you got 3% strength if you could UK and Ireland and you got 5% strength if you don\u2019t include it. So well we\u2019re very helpful with everything that we got in place and the consistent results that international is showing that we\u2019re hopeful that that\u2019s going to continue.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMC", "", "Okay, great that was helpful. And then I was wondering if you could talk about why Willis has been able to grow North America while some peers, particularly in the middle market have had more difficulty?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Well I\u2019m looking at Don Bailey and I think our management is outstanding. We really spend a lot of time with our producers, I said that and then I\u2019ll let Don answer this but we spend a lot of time with our producers. We\u2019re very intense about the relationship we have with our producers. We have lots of growth oriented training that talks you growing our business and retaining our clients. Our client retention is 92% and growing, but if you take loss for cause, out of that 8% differential, it\u2019s about 3 or 4% that\u2019s actually lost, so that\u2019s a great number. I think that the way we run our practices and our specialisms which means there are practices help our producers feel specialized in the areas that our clients are interested in and if you take all of those things together, that\u2019s the reason why we grow as well as we do. There is a simply a different model that we execute in North America, lots of the time in our branches around the country are spent in servicing our clients\u2019 needs, in talking about what they need to have done rather than a lot of administration and more that\u2019s going to continue as we continue to do more administration outside of branches and less in branches. So I would say those are all the reasons. Well, Don is here.", "Don Bailey", "", "There is nothing to add \u2013", "Joe Plumeri", "", "I missed anything.", "Don Bailey", "", "No, you didn\u2019t.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "I wanted to answer that because I wanted to say that I think he is doing a great job and you would say that.", "Don Bailey", "", "Maybe he would.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMC", "", "Thanks for that, has there been any change to how you define the middle market in terms of client size?", "Don Bailey", "", "Not really, we just a lot more of that business by virtue of the HRH combination than we ever had before so we\u2019ve got some great critical mass in our core business which allows us to deploy a lot of the strategy that Joe was just talking about. It makes the recruiting game a lot more wide open than it was before, we can recruit from everybody, because we\u2019ve got a space, a critical mass in that space and we\u2019ve got it in cities all across the country. We now have a 130 plus offices all over North America. So our business in the middle market is not one that\u2019s just focused around major cities, it\u2019s a secondary and tertiary city presence as well.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMC", "", "Okay, and then one last question, regarding the UK pension plan, was there any impact from foreign exchange mark-to-market on the plan in the quarter?", "Stephen Wood", "", "No there wasn\u2019t that much impact actually assets increased and the dollar weekend, so it had a base (inaudible) up.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMC", "", "Alright, great. Thank you, guys.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "", "Hey good morning everybody.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Hi Brian, how are you doing?", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "", "Good. I had a question, I\u2019m just looking at some of the numbers here. The corporate expenses looked like they were down substantially, is that due to FX or is that really where a lot of the expense saves have been coming out of?", "Stephen Wood", "", "That\u2019s our corporate expenses as we put our hedging through and the amount of hedging that went through their was lower this year than it was last year, so the amount from hedging which was lower.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "", "Okay, so that\u2019s the principal reason why there is a big decline.", "Stephen Wood", "", "Yes sir.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "", "Got you, and then next question, are you seeing any increase or any change in kind of the competitive pricing among the insurance brokers out there, or is it everybody kind of being disciplined with kind of fees right now?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "I don\u2019t think everybody is the same. I think that you hear a lot of stories about the competitiveness of people dropping their fees to keep accounts. You heard out all the time, but I\u2019m not going to suggest it comes from anyone place but you do hear stories about that all the time, we\u2019re competing for accounts and some (inaudible) we won or we loss because so well they drop their fee enormously. Yes, it\u2019s still out there, is it prevalent rather than once in a while, I think it\u2019s more prevalent than it is once in a while. But in our particular case, we do most of our business in commissions, and when we do business on a fee basis, I do hear stories that people are dropping their fees a lot in order to hold onto accounts and come back and play another day. I think that\u2019s accurate. Don, you want to?", "Don Bailey", "", "The other dynamic is just the clients in this environment are looking for more for less. So we\u2019ve got that dynamic that plays out on top of what Joe just described which is brokers who are looking for that elusive organic growth who are increasingly more competitive on their fees.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "", "Thank you very much.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", " The next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Thanks. Good morning all.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Hi Meyer.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "If I can take one more whack at the contingent commission issue or the conversion, I understand that only a small portion of the $12 million gap is going to show up as commission revenue this quarter, but I would think that this quarter would also include the converted contingents from previous quarters. Is there any way to sort of ballparking that total figure?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "No, it\u2019s what it is, there is nothing else there. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve tried to bear down on this issue for what it is. The $12 million gets converted to upfront, it doesn\u2019t happen at one time contingence by their nature, don\u2019t happen all at once, it\u2019s a book of business that is calculated over a course of the year, not in one quarter, and it\u2019s not done on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And it\u2019s certainly doesn\u2019t include because the legacy HRH contingence that they\u2019re necessarily going to be everything in there that\u2019s going to be converted. So when you put all that together it\u2019s just not what it appears to be, it\u2019s not part of organic revenue, the organic revenue growth is there. I tried to explain it as easily and as thoughtfully as I possibly can for you.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Okay, let me move to a different subject and on the reinsurance side, can you give us a breakdown of how much reinsurance brokerage revenue is fees versus commission?", "Peter Hearn", "", "It\u2019s about 30% fees.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Okay. So not too different from the primary side?", "Peter Hearn", "", "No.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "And basically mirrors of across the board.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Okay, if your expectation that there is more growth opportunity in terms of market share gains from larger competitors or smaller, and this is again on the reinsurance side?", "Peter Hearn", "", "I think it\u2019s both Meyer, I think we feel comfortable, we can compete against anybody, any place or any time. So it depends on the situation. So either large or small.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Okay, great. That covers me, thanks so much.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from David West of Davenport & Company.", "David West \u2013 Davenport & Company", "", "Good morning.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Hi, David.", "David West \u2013 Davenport & Company", "", "First question on the benefits side you mentioned the obvious that many employers have lower head counts, could you talk about the pricing trends overall on benefits?", "Don Bailey", "", "I mean you\u2019re going to see in that business inflation factors that play out in the rates. So those have certainly moderated from what we\u2019ve seen in the past, you\u2019ll see a lower impact on that in our business that you might have seen historically.", "David West \u2013 Davenport & Company", "", "Very good, and then lastly Stephen nicely outlined your debt maturities and so forth this year. Could you maybe update us on your thoughts on 2010 as to where you may get on the EBITDA-to-debt targets and what implication that might have for share repurchase activity?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Stephen and I\u2019ll put a period at the end. \t", "Stephen Wood", "", "Debt-to-EBITDA at the moment is in the region about 2.5, that\u2019s EBITDA and we expect to go continue to bring that down as the year goes on during this year and to get below 2.5 towards end of this year.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "And when that happens as I said on a couple of previous calls, we\u2019ll take a serious look at buybacks.", "David West \u2013 Davenport & Company", "", "Very good, thanks so much.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Thank you. Have a nice day.", "Operator", "", "And our final question comes from Keith Alexander of JPMC.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMC", "", "Hi, thanks for the follow-up. I just had a question, have you guys observed any impact from the recent large losses in Chile and elsewhere on terms and conditions in those lines in geographies?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "We were talking about that earlier before the call and the expert on the subject is Peter Hearn\u2019s so I\u2019m going to let him answer the question.", "Peter Hearn", "", "Keith not yet, it takes a while for these to percolate through the system. As you may have read in our year report that there were $16 billion of loss in the first quarter of 2010 and it really hasn\u2019t moved the dial on rates at all obviously the rig loss in the Gulf is a very large and potentially could be the largest maritime loss ever, and that could take time for these things to percolate through the system. Usually at a minimum three to six months and more likely nine months.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMC", "", "Okay, and then, thanks that was helpful, I was also wondering if there is any update or if you could provide an update on the progression of the Stanford Financial lawsuit?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Yes, Stanford Financial law suit, I\u2019ll let Adam Ciongoli give you an update on that, our General Counsel.", "Adam Ciongoli", "", "We filed a motion to dismiss and there are four cases overall, three in Federal court, one was originally filed in State court has now been removed to Federal court, although for the same Federal district judge. We filed a motion to dismiss and two of the Federal claims and are expecting an answer from the plaintiffs any day now the third Federal case, there has been no movement, we\u2019re waiting for scheduling order and the State case as I said has been transferred to Federal court and we\u2019re waiting to see whether the judge decides to move it back to State court.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMC", "", "Great. Thank you guys.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Okay Keith. Any other questions.", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions at this time.

Our call today is hosted by Joe Plumeri, Willis Group Holdings' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.", "A replay of the call will be available through November 28th, 2010 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time by calling 888-385-2289 from within the US or 1-203-369-3262 from outside the US, with pass code.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.", "I will now turn the call over to Joe", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Thank you, Kelly, and hi, everybody, and welcome, and thank you for joining our call today. ", "On the call with me today are Grahame Millwater, our Group President; Don Bailey, CEO of North America; Michael Neborak, our CFO; and as usual other members, all of the members of our executive team and management team are also here, and will be happy to answer all of your questions.", "Let me talk about the conditions that impact the third quarter 2010 and a little bit about the remainder of 2010. I am very happy with what we\u2019ve delivered this quarter and in the year-to-date. We have reported exceptional organic growth in the face of a really tough external environment that is little changed from the last time we spoke.", "In the US economic and unemployment remain anemic, a number of European economies also remained pressured. There are some bright spots, particularly among the emerging economies. And in addition, as I indicated the last quarter, the general rate environment remains soft and in the absence of a major loss activity, we see little term, little near-term sign of change.", "Looking at earnings, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.37 for the quarter compared with $0.53 a year-ago with both years affected by tax items. If you look at adjusted earnings and apply the underlying effective rate of 26%, adjusted earnings per share would have been about the same in both periods. ", "Our culture of teamwork and discipline has served us well in this environment continues to serve us well with our commitment to growth and our focus on cost control. Our commitment to growth is reflected especially in another 4% organic growth in commissions and fees that we delivered in both the third quarter and in a year-to-date period, so that\u2019s been pretty consistent and our ability to be able to deliver that I think shows the underlying sales cultures that I make reference to. This compares very well to the 2% organic growth that we delivered in the corresponding periods last year.", "Each of our segments also delivered organic growth in both the quarter and year-to-date periods. This is especially something that we\u2019re proud of, because all of our operating segments grew, again in a very difficult environment. ", "In the third quarter, North America grew 2%, where probably the rates are softest around the world and the economy is the worst. International grew 6% and global grew 4%. So across the board, our diversity, our ability to be able to distribute our product again shines through. ", "This Group continues to be driven in the main by new business generation across all segments. We spend a lot of time on it, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re good at it, and we can better at. Net growth of 13% for the quarter and a steady client retention, so you take the two \u2013 so clearly both of those are trending in the right direction, and there is no reason to believe that that trend wouldn\u2019t continue. ", "I\u2019m also happy that we delivered adjusted margin expansion in the quarter. The 140-basis point adjusted margin expansion largely reflects growth in organic commissions and fees, rigorous expense management, and favorable foreign currency movement, and that\u2019s partly been offset by higher incentive compensation. ", "What do I mean by incentive compensation? I really mean the amortization of the retention award and higher payouts and higher payouts basically come from North America where we raise the payout during the integration period that was effective at the beginning of this year, so the payouts are higher and we\u2019re getting higher revenue growth out of North America than we got the year before. So as a result, you see the incentive compensation line going up.", "We increased the headcount also since last year on purpose, because we\u2019re trying to support and fuel the areas that are growing the most for us. International has been a consistent growth leader for us for a long time over the last couple of years and we want to support that and we want to feed that to make sure that it continues to do that. And our global segments especially we\u2019ve grown and added support levels and resources to our areas in London and across the world. ", "So even though North America has lowered its head count following the HRH integration, in a lot of other areas we\u2019ve tried to reinforce very, very good growth, so that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve done on purpose. Shaping Our Future also continues to deliver net benefits, around $12 million in the third quarter, even as the number of the programs have become entrenched in the way we do business. ", "Now let me drill down a little bit into the segment results. North America as I said before has just been terrific. Not much though has changed as it relates to the external environment. ", "The economy and the recovery remains anemic and protracted and the employment recovery is slow, the rate environment remains soft, and there is little evidence of a turn, you\u2019ve heard that before, I\u2019m just going to tell you what everybody else has told you. ", "CIAB data for the third quarter indicated rate is down 5% compared with 6% in the second quarter, even in areas where we\u2019re seeing some increases, lower underlying exposure basis or offsetting gains, and we really don\u2019t see much of an improvement in exposures either.", "In this environment, 2% organic growth for the quarter and 1% positive on a year-to-date basis is just an unbelievable result, especially when I see what\u2019s happening elsewhere with our competitors. Delivery against the rate wind of 2%, that\u2019s a net new business of 4%, and so we\u2019re very proud of that, and my congratulations to our North American colleagues.", "Our producers continued to generate double digit new business growth and client retention even got better. We even saw positive results across a number of regions, including the Northeast, Atlantic, and South Central, and some of the standout cities in the quarter were New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Atlanta, Dallas, and Los Angeles, which is really great about having said that, is that those cities are a blend of former HRH offices and former Willis offices, so that now that our impact in these major cities show the ramifications and results of the acquisition. ", "Our employee benefit business, our largest practice was up 4%, its second consecutive quarter of growth and a great result in a really tough labor market. So if we can do that in a tough labor market, it tells us again that we\u2019re heading in the right direction as it relates to our value proposition and employee benefits in North America.", "Now, our construction practice which is about 10% of our business in North America was down low single digits better than last year, but that\u2019s in an area of the economy that is still not seeing much sign of improvement. So you got 2% improvement in revenue, when 10% of your business is going down. Again that shows great strength and our ability to retain our people and to grow our new business. We continued to see good results in a number of specialty practice areas such as executive risk healthcare and financial services. ", "North America\u2019s operating margin remained steady at 21.4%. The results that our North American business delivered really reflects I think the success of the integration efforts and the teamwork across our enhanced network, and this success is illustrated by as I said great top line growth and even better client retention and strong producer retention, again in the aftermath of a major integration and a major acquisition which we\u2019re really, really enthusiastic about and proud of. ", "Let me turn to international, international continues to deliver with organic growth in commissions and fees of 6% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. And when I say 6% international, that means all of our offices outside of the United States. The new business generation remains in the double digits again against the headwind of 4%. The strength and diversity of our international network I think is reflected in these results, even if some of the economies in which we operate remained pressured. ", "Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe again all delivered double-digit growth with really strong contributions from Venezuela, Brazil, and Chile in Latin America; China and Korea in Asia were simply outstanding; and Poland and Russia in Eastern Europe continued to show great growth. Continental Europe was slightly positive in a seasonably light quarter for those countries.

That\u2019s investments in systems like Epic in the United States which is, or North America is an accounting system, and everything can be driven off of it, continue to support Eclipse here in London, Will Place which is our new placement system. So that these things in building out our platform and enhance the platform to support our business units give us future efficiencies so that we can continue to run the place efficiency and look to drive out cost in all areas of our business, which gives us the ability to maintain disciplined expense management, as Mike said, continue to strengthen our balance sheet.

International is a very diversified place, Mark, just to give you an example. It makes sense for us to grow in China. It makes sense for us to grow in Brazil. It makes sense for us to grow in a lot of parts of Latin America. It makes sense for us to grow in the Middle East. It makes sense for us to grow in Russia. These places they\u2019ve been big contributions, and in some cases in emerging markets, we\u2019re market leaders.

So our specialisms in London are among the finest and we have to make sure that we constantly reinforce that. And in North America, we\u2019ve done a great job at even reducing our headcount. But, again, where we selectively fine producer hires, we\u2019re going to do that. So it\u2019s not an indiscriminate hiring that\u2019s going on, it is a very calculated, very selective approaching to being able to reinforce our people, reinforce our capability, and you are seeing that in our results that relates to our revenue growth.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust ", "Would the strategy then be to take any margin outside and reinvest it? So you're talking steady margins?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "No, I wouldn\u2019t say that we would give up the ideas to take margin improvement and to reinvest all of that margin improvement. I would say that it\u2019s the ability to be able to grow our top line at levels that we\u2019ve been growing it, which has been very good, not give up all of our margin, but certainly in a selective approach to investing in our resources, maybe give a little bit of it, but expect to grow our margins.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust ", "Thank you.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Keith Alexander with JPMorgan.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMorgan ", "Hi, good morning.

The impact of capital markets, which by the way has been outstanding since we hired that Group led by Tony Ursano, has been terrific, has had very little impact on the third quarter. The third quarter as a matter of fact was very, very small, so it was de minimis. We continued to have a very robust pipeline in the capital markets area and we have been retained on a number of fronts.

But specifically your question being what kind of an impact was it on the third quarter, which is relatively little, if none.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMorgan ", "Okay, thanks for that. My next question is on the investments the company has made over the last several quarters. How long should it take for revenues to catch up and margins to expand, and perhaps if you could talk about it by segment?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Well, I think revenues have caught up pretty good. I mean the reason that the revenues were 4% and continue to lead the league. I don\u2019t know what will happen with the rest of our competitors. But I\u2019m really proud of 4%. I mean I\u2019m proud of North America, 2%. I mean, it appears that where we have invested we\u2019re doing the right thing. And I can see it coming out in some of the accretive hires that we\u2019ve made. ", "You see some of the investment, in the last question, with regard to capital markets, that was an investment we made, that was a whole team from Bank of America that we decided to hire, and that\u2019s accretive right off the back. So I think that there is a catch-up already. You\u2019re going to see even more of a spread as we seed for the future, as we continue to look to the future to continue to grow our revenue in an environment that continues to be by all accounts soft for a long time. So I\u2019m very pleased, I\u2019m happy that we\u2019re growing the revenue that way we are and looking at our totality of our business. ", "I would be upset if we had great margin growth and it was at the expense of no revenue and everything on the backside of continuing to watch or and never investment, where we still watch cost very, very, very closely. As I said earlier, we\u2019re making lot of investments in our platform. Our platform which is our service hubs all over the world, our technology hubs all over the world, give us the ability to get future efficiencies that you don\u2019t see today, but you\u2019re going to see those efficiencies in a year or two from now. So the plan is working I think extremely, extremely well.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMorgan", "I get your point about the growth.

One last question and then I'll hop back in the queue. You spoke broadly about limited to no exposure growth, but can you differentiate between the lines of business and types of client?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "The lines of business, it would take too long to go through each line. But I would tell you that on an across the board basis, I really don\u2019t see and I\u2019m looking at my colleagues as I\u2019m saying this around the room, any increase in exposures at all.

Your free cash was roughly flat this quarter and obviously you\u2019re still doing stuff on the debt side.

By the way, Dan, the answer that Mike gave you with regard to our ratios have been consistent. We\u2019ve always said that we want to get around 2.1 times, 2.2 times, and that would make us comfortable.

There are others that are making acquisitions one by one by one, when in HRH we did it all at once, we got great efficiencies, we got margins over 20%.

Don do you have anything you want to add to that?", "Don Bailey", "I\u2019d just add Joe that, as you said, we\u2019ve got the platform in North America that we wanted, and we\u2019re executing on it, and you\u2019re starting to see those results. We\u2019re in all the major cities as you highlighted Joe. We have very good numbers in those major cities and we had a lot of real good numbers in secondary and tertiary cities as well.

", "So I think you\u2019re going to have some of them very small life businesses that are impacted, the individual market maybe impacted, but overall we think employers are going to increasingly need our services, and this business for the most part will continue to be distributed through employers. So we think net-net, we\u2019re well positioned, and this is going to be a good opportunity for us as we go forward. Complexity tends to be a space where we play well.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Just add to that, I think our value proposition is outstanding. You can see by the 4% growth in employee benefits in North America where again it\u2019s 20%, 25% of our business is outstanding. ", "The value proposition I think plays a bigger part with employers wanting to understand more about what their options are and how they can help their employees, especially in a dwindling expense base, where I only got so much money to spend to help my employees and we\u2019re finding more and more in our value proposition as we talk to our people that employers are asking more questions and looking for more assistance as to the best way to use that dollar that they do have. So it appears that even though we\u2019re not clear about healthcare reform, but we are clear about the fact, right, Don, that people are looking for more and more help.", "Mark Hughes \u2013 SunTrust ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Cliff Gallant with KBW. ", "Cliff Gallant \u2013 KBW ", "Good morning.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Hi Cliff.", "Cliff Gallant \u2013 KBW ", "Hi. My question has to do with \u2013 there's a I think a market thesis out there that there is a certain large international insurance carrier that had a couple of financial problems a few years ago, which has pressured rates throughout the industry. I was curious if there happened to be anyone there who could comment on whether or not that that is still true? ", "Also regarding that same insurance company, there was a thesis out there that because this insurer paid lower brokerage commissions, that as the industry changed, or if that company lost market share, that the insurance brokers would benefit from higher the commissions transferring from that company to other insurers. I was wondering if anyone there could comment?", "Joe Plumeri", "", "No one here wants to comment on that subject.", "Cliff Gallant \u2013 KBW ", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Keith Alexander with JPMorgan. ", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMorgan ", "Hi. Can you guys talk a bit about the thought process behind recent initiatives including the Group mining practice, the Captive Insurance facility in Malta, the agri business in the metal and plastics program with Chartis? I know it's a broad range.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Yes, that\u2019s a lot. Those are lot of initiatives. When you talk about the Captive in Malta is simply to expand our ability. I was at the conference in Chicago for self insurance and I told them that Malta was just another way that we wanted to expand our experience there. As it relates to mining and plastics, I mean what this business is about a specialization, this business is about our investment in specialization. ", "No longer do you go out and say you want to buy insurance or you want buy insurance from us, it\u2019s about understanding \u2013 we have a thing called The Willis Cause, and the first piece of the cause is to understanding our clients\u2019 industries and knowledge off those industries. And by having specializations, by enhancing our ability to understand those industries gives us a greater ability to be able to have our clients feel that we understand them. And then as a result of understanding them can give them solutions that nobody else can give him. So you\u2019re going to see us continuing to expand our specialization base.", "Keith Alexander \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "And our next question comes from Adam Klauber with Macquarie. ", "Adam Klauber \u2013 Macquarie ", "Thanks. Just one or two follow-ups. Could you just give us any guidance on the amortization of cash retention payments? They've obviously been growing at a relatively rapid pace. Will that slow down eventually?", "Michael Neborak", "", "Well, eventually, yes, it\u2019ll slowdown. In the fourth quarter the amount would be a little bit larger than it was here in the third quarter. And then in 2011, the total amount will be greater than 2010. And early in 2012, it\u2019ll converge, and so there will no kind of year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter increase.", "Adam Klauber \u2013 Macquarie ", "Okay. And also can you help us on the tax rate going forward, what can we expect?", "Michael Neborak", "", "Yes, I think 26% is a good rate to use going forward. I tell you, it could come in at 26.5%. Well, that depends on our income coming out of North America. But 26%, 26.5% is really the rates that I would use going forward as you model the business.", "Adam Klauber \u2013 Macquarie ", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "And at this time, there are no further questions.", "Joe Plumeri", "", "Okay.

Please proceed Mr. Millay.", "Roger F. Millay", "", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Roger Millay. Welcome to the Towers Watson earnings call. I\u2019m here today with John Haley, Towers Watson\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.", "Please refer to our website for this morning\u2019s press release.

After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Okay. Thank you, Roger. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and our guidance for the first quarter of the 2012 fiscal year.", "I\u2019m pleased to report that revenues for the quarter were $851 million, an increase of 14% over prior year reported revenues and an increase of 8% on a constant currency basis. Our organic growth rate, which adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, was 6% for the quarter. For the fiscal year, revenues were $3.26 billion.", "The fourth quarter marks the end of our first full fiscal year as Towers Watson and we are very pleased with our financial results and our integration progress. We are well positioned to build upon our success from this year and we have a strong platform for long-term profitable growth. In recognition of our strong performance this year, we announced earlier today that the Towers Watson Board has approved a 33% dividend increase for fiscal 2012. We view this as further evidence of the confidence that management and the Board have in Towers Watson and our future.", "Turning to segment performance, all of our segments performed well and achieved organic revenue growth. Our segment organic growth this quarter is as follows. Benefits 4%, Risk and Financial Services 1%, and Talent and Rewards 14%.", "Our revenue growth reflects wins from both new and existing clients. Clients have responded very positively to the broad array of services and deep expertise we can provide as Towers Watson. Our associates have done an outstanding job of building strong relationships and partnering with our clients to understand their challenges and offer creative solutions.", "It\u2019s also important to note that we still have easier prior year comparables due to where we were as Towers Watson at this time last year. The fourth quarter of last year was only our second quarter of operation as Towers Watson.", "Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $159 million, up 35% from last year and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 19%. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.59 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.6. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 18% over the prior year.", "Adjusted diluted earnings per share include a normalized income tax rate and exclude non-recurring other income transaction and integration costs, stock-based compensation costs from restricted shares issued in conjunction with the merger, and the amortization of merger accounting intangible assets. We remain focused on profitable growth and are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities.", "Now, we will review the performance of our segments. For the quarter, the Benefit segment had revenues of $483 million, including the revenues from Aliquant, which we acquired in late December 2010, Benefit segment revenues were up on a constant currency basis. On an organic basis, revenues were up 4%.", "Retirement, Technology and Administration Solutions and Health and Group Benefits were all up. Retirement revenues increased 2% on a constant currency basis and revenues increased in all geographic regions. As we previously noted, retirement historically lags behind economic recoveries, so we\u2019re pleased to see this kind of growth.", "In Technology and Administration Solutions, revenues increased in the US and declined slightly in Europe. The increase in the US was largely due to the revenues from Aliquant. The integration of Aliquant into our US business continues to go well. Activity in the marketplace continues to be strong.", "We had low double-digit revenue growth in Health and Group Benefits this quarter. Client demand continues to increase as companies look for solutions to manage employee health and productivity issues.", "The Benefits segment had solid topline results in the second half of fiscal 2011 and we expect that momentum to carry over into fiscal 2010 with organic growth led by Health and Group Benefits.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to Risk and Financial Services. For the quarter, the Risk and Financial Services segment had revenues of $194 million, including EMB revenues were up 10% on a constant currency basis. Revenues were up 1% on an organic basis.", "Risk Consulting and Software revenues benefited from a smooth integration with EMB. We continue to be excited about the opportunities that our strength and capabilities in this area could generate. Regulatory changes and M&A activity continue to drive demand. On an organic basis, revenues grew in the low single digits. We're looking for continued growth in fiscal \u201812.", "In Brokerage, strong new business activity in Europe and improving pricing conditions in the property catastrophe line led to low single digit revenue growth. Revenues in Investment Services declined on a constant currency basis. Investment has experienced a decrease in traditional ad hoc client work and while our pipeline remains healthy we\u2019ve seen sales cycles lengthen recently. The team has a plan to resume growth in fiscal \u201812 and we expect to see them turn the corner on last year's challenges.", "In summary, we expect growth to continue in RFS led by the integration of EMB and the strong capabilities they\u2019ve added. We see opportunities in our RFS markets and hope to drive improved organic growth results in fiscal \u201812.", "Now let me turn to Talent and Rewards. For the quarter the Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $136 million. On a constant currency basis revenues were up 7% from the prior year quarter. After adjusting for the revenues they transferred to Pay Governance and excluding revenues acquired in the EMEA, Talent and Rewards had 14% organic revenue growth.", "On an organic basis revenues increased in all lines of business; Executive Compensation, Rewards, Talent and Communications and Data, Surveys and Technology. The increase in organic revenues in Executive Compensation was largely due to an increase in activity in North America in both management and compensation consulting and strong growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America.", "In North America, we worked with many companies to help prepare for new Dodd-Frank requirements that went into effect in 2011. We\u2019ve seen a strong pickup in demand in Asia-Pacific particularly in China as local companies expand nationally, regionally and globally and look to implement Executive pay plans that support their growth agenda.", "Revenues also increased in Rewards, Talent and Communication, with strong activity across all our regions. As companies look for growth they begun to implement programs to reengage their employees, drive pay per performance, and develop talent. We\u2019ve won a significant number of these projects with existing and new clients due to our broader array of integrated services and tools, and bigger scale in all major regions.", "Revenues in Data, Surveys and Technology increased in all geographic regions and was led by Asia. Client interest in benchmarking metrics, measuring ROI, and HR organizational effectiveness has driven demand globally for our practices.", "Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the organic growth in this segment for the quarter and the year. As you know, this is our most cyclical business, so assuming continued economic expansion we expect this segment to be our highest growth segment. In any event we\u2019re forecasting continued solid growth in the first quarter given our projects underway and the solid pipeline.", "We\u2019re very pleased about our results this quarter and for the year. It\u2019s a reflection of how well the integration has progressed. Our associates have skillfully adapted the changes in their day-to-day work environment while helping us grow the business through working with clients. As we wind down the bulk of our integration activities, we look forward to reenergizing our growth plans.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger F. Millay", "", "Thanks, John. As John mentioned we performed extremely well this quarter. We continued to deliver solid, topline growth with a very healthy increase in operating earnings in comparison to a period in which revenues were very soft and we have not yet realized significant cost synergy savings. The topline revenue growth translated into good segment margins. As a reminder our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger accounting and transaction and integration costs.", "All of our segments exceeded our margin expectation in the seasonally softer quarter. The Benefits segment had a 33% margin for the quarter. Risk and Financial Services had a 20% margin for the quarter, which is typically the weakest quarter for this business. Talent and Rewards had a 13% margin for the quarter, up significantly from a small loss in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "Net income attributable to controlling interests for the quarter was $44 million. Excluding transaction and integration costs, stock based compensation arising from the merger, the amortization of merger accounting intangible assets, non-recurring and other income, and assuming a normalized income tax rate, adjusted net income was $78 million.", "This quarter, we had $23 million of transaction and integration costs versus $29 million last quarter and $38 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. While these costs are choppy and difficult to preciously predict quarter-to-quarter, we expect to see a gradually slowing trend in these costs over the next year as we near the end of our three-year integration plan. This quarter the majority of the costs related to our large IT initiatives, integrating both the ERP software and hardware platforms of the company.", "I\u2019m happy to report that we successfully launched the pilot deployment of our new Oracle ERP system on August 1. We will now gradually deploy through the rest of the world over the next year and half. This project will improve internal efficiency and builds a scalable platform to support future growth.", "We also had some real estate and HR related costs this quarter although not at the level of last quarter. The normalized tax rate for the year came in higher than we expected due primarily to a shift in the geographical mix of income versus our forecast.", "Our operating outperformance this quarter was driven by the United States, a high tax rate country, while some lower rate countries underperformed against forecast. This led to catch-up adjustment for the year, which was all recorded in the fourth quarter driving this quarter\u2019s normalized rate up to 43%. If the fiscal year \u201912 geographical mix is consistent with fiscal year \u201911, we expect the normalized tax rate to continue to be above our earlier expectations and be in the range of 37% to 38%.", "Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.59, a decrease from $0.77 last year when we recorded a significant income tax benefit due to the release of valuation allowances. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.06, up 18% versus last year.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a very strong financial position. We ended the quarter with about $450 million of cash that\u2019s available for our use. We didn\u2019t have any borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter, but we do expect to borrow $75 million to $100 million from the credit facility when we pay bonuses in September. We still have $99 million of notes plus accrued interest payable to B1 shareholders from the tender offer that was completed in June 2010.", "Our free cash flow remains strong in the fourth quarter and we ended the year with over $400 million in excess of our expectations. I should note that a part of our free cash flow strength this year resulted from the payment of only a half-year of bonuses in fiscal year \u201811 due to the timing of the merger. Going forward, we will have a full year bonus payments each September. Also in fiscal year \u201812, we expect CapEx to run a bit higher than the fiscal year \u201811 \u2013 than in fiscal year \u201811 due to our IT integration initiatives.", "We have now repurchased about 800,000 shares under our $100 million repurchase authorization and used about half of the authorization. As John mentioned, we are also increasing our dividend, which reflects our confidence in the integration activities and our ongoing business. The new dividend level equates to about a 10% payout ratio, which will use as a reference point to consider possible future dividend increases.", "Now, let's review our outlook for fiscal year 2012. Today we\u2019ll give you guidance for the first quarter of fiscal \u201812 as well as some context for our full-year fiscal \u201812 outlook. As a reminder we\u2019ll provide full fiscal year guidance at our Analyst Day on September 19.", "For the quarter, we expect revenues will be in the range of $800 million to $825 million. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.07. Our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be around 18% for the quarter. This guidance assumes an economic and market environment similar to the fourth quarter. We are also conscious that we\u2019re beginning to compare it to prior quarters where the topline momentum of the business and the market began to improve.", "Internally, we're evaluating our results on a comparable basis for all periods using adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Our adjusted measures of income include a normalized income tax rate and exclude transaction and integration costs, stock-based compensation costs from restricted shares issued in conjunction with the merger, and the amortization of merger accounting intangible assets. Our adjusted measures of income also exclude non-recurring other income.", "For the quarter, our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of $1.60 to the British pound and an average exchange rate of $1.40 to the Euro. We expect to have a normalized income tax rate of 37% to 38% and diluted shares outstanding of a little over $73 million. We expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to be significantly lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share.", "Now, we will review our first quarter guidance for the segments. Let's start with Benefits, for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we expect revenues in the Benefits segment to grow in the low single digits on a constant currency basis, and our range is 2% to 5%. The NOI margin for Benefits is expected to be around 30% for the quarter. For Benefits, the first fiscal quarter is seasonally weaker.", "Next in Risk and Financial Services, we expect constant currency revenue growth will be in the range of 7% to 11% for the first quarter. This guidance includes revenue from EMB. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low 20% range for the quarter.", "Finally in Talent and Rewards, we\u2019re forecasting that constant currency revenues will be up 6% to 9% for the quarter. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low 20% range. As we mentioned earlier, for this segment, the first half of the fiscal year is typically, seasonally stronger than the second half of the year. For fiscal year \u201912 overall, we\u2019re targeting mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth with an adjusted EBITDA margin between 18% and 19%. Our comparables will get more challenging as the year progresses and we\u2019re vary of challenges from our systems implementation, which engages all of our front-end associates in new operational processes, and of the potential headwinds from the macro environment.", "Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance for the quarter and for the year. I\u2019ve been incredibly impressed with the ability of the Towers Watson team to do the work required to deliver strong financial results while also integrating the company.", "Now, I will turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Okay. Thanks, Roger. Before we move on to your questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of our associates. Our first full year as Towers Watson was a big success, thanks to their hard work. Now, we will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks for taking my question, just on the free cash flow, full-year bonus, what would that \u2013 can you try to size up for us and also maybe the CapEx, will that be the only \u2013 will that be the only sort of unusuals in what seems like very strong fiscal year \u201911 free cash flow?", "Roger F. Millay", "", "Yes. So this year\u2019s bonus and I think you see it on the schedule of the discretionary comp line, so that's for the year, this year $338 million. And we do pay out some taxes that go on top of that a bit. So I mean that's your reference point for full year and so that gives you a sense of what the difference might be in free cash flow for half-year versus a full year. I'm sorry the second piece, Paul?", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Can you size the increase in CapEx?", "Roger F. Millay", "I think we\u2019ll have more detail on that in the September meeting. If you look at the cash flow statement, we came in around $77 million just without the software costs. I mean it's not going to be in the magnitude of double, but it could be $20 million or so higher than that. But again, we\u2019ll give you more specific number in the Analyst Meeting.", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. And then just a couple of housekeeping follow-ups. The retirement liability was down, I think $135 million Q-on-Q, is that just due to the asset performance or something else? And then on discretionary bonus, it was up 42% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s kind of flat in the third quarter. What should we be modelling that off of, segment income or EBITDA, how should we think about that?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah. So you're right on the retirement liability. The main driver there is asset performance. With respect to discretionary comp, I think that will probably be a little bit steadier in FY \u201912. This year as we went through quarter-to-quarter, we were kind of adjusting to where we thought we should come out. And probably we measure it as a percentage of pre-bonus operating income, and if you look at it that way probably in the high 30% range is where you\u2019ll see us circle.", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. If I could sneak one more and I apologize. You basically looks like you\u2019re not projecting any operating margin improvement this year, is that just sort of the macro plus the IT or is there something else that would suggest you can do better incremental margins and you\u2019ve done, then for some reason incremental margins are changing going forward than they have been in the past?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah. I\u2019ll give my answer and then I don\u2019t know, John, may have something he wants to add in. But the story isn't any different than what we've been saying in the last couple of quarters. We think the range that we\u2019ve landed in is a range that is appropriate; it makes sense for the company based on our integration activities. We have been adding folks. We haven't added a lot of people, but the businesses that are growing; we have been adding some people and we had a pipeline to continue to add. So we think that range at this point is appropriate.", "John Haley", "Yes, I mean, I think Roger really captured that. As he said we\u2019ll give more detail on the Analyst Meeting, but right now we\u2019re targeting the EBITDA percent, adjusted EBITDA margin somewhere between 18% and 19%. We do have some integration activities, some important integration activities this year as we roll out some of our new systems and that will absorb some of the time of our front-end associates. And we are conscious of the changes in the macro environment and what that could bring. So we feel reasonably comfortable that we can keep to the margin improvement that we\u2019ve show, but we\u2019re not at this point prepared to project anything further.", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "", "Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. I want to piggyback on some of the stuff that Paul asked. Just in terms of looking at the bonus comp and adjusting it for a full year. If I remember correctly, Towers Perrin had about a half-year adjustment, so should we think of it as kind of adjusting about a quarter of the number because of the full-year Watson Wyatt and then kind of a half-year of Towers Perrin?", "John Haley", "Yes, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re saying about the quarter here, but last September because we closed the merger on January 1, we paid a half-year of bonuses in September 2010, so that was for Towers Watson. And we had settled prior to the merger, we had kind of settled up the legacy bonus situations for the two companies. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s a full-year versus a half-year comparison.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "", "Okay, I\u2019m going to follow-up with you on that after the call. But just following up also on the EBITDA numbers, should we think of it as kind of flat EBITDA, but could go down because of integration activities because the range actually implies that you guys would potentially be going down year-over-year?", "Roger F. Millay", "", "Yes, I mean, we\u2019re down into point this and point that right, so we came up for the year at 18.9. I think we\u2019ve characterized the puts and takes I suppose that we see for the year. And I think what we\u2019re really saying is this is a range that we\u2019ve landed in, although as you say at the high end this year and that\u2019s a range that we think make sense going forward. So we are not trying to signal that we see things that are systemically going to push margins down, just that when you look at point ones and point twos, it\u2019s not really manageable at that level.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Right, the reason I am asking the question is because I\u2019ve talked to John and John you\u2019ve said in the past that you\u2019re comfortable with this range and you would actually prefer to be investing some incremental margins to really drive long-term sustainable revenue growth and that\u2019s kind of the tact that I\u2019m \u2013 of the question I\u2019m asking?", "John Haley", "I think, Shlomo, you have that exactly right, I think that is what we would \u2013 that is what we\u2019d be looking at doing. I think if Roger is answering it though, it really is the same perspective. If we\u2019re talking about a tenth of a percent here there that we might come down to invest to do that, we would probably be willing to do that. We are not talking about necessarily moving something down whole percentage or something like that.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Okay.", "John Haley", "The message we would give is this. Look we \u2013 this was recently much better year than we thought we were going to have coming into it and the margins are historically high. We\u2019re pretty comfortable with the way we\u2019re operating. We have a little bit of a concern about just the macro economy coming into this next year probably a much bigger concern now than we might have had only two or three months ago. We have a little bit of a concern just about the whole rolling out of our new billing systems and everything with associates around the world and just that at the margin that might sap a little bit. And we want to invest but as we want to invest what we wanted to do is take what might have been margin improvements and investments as generally what we\u2019re going to be looking to do, but we have just a little bit of concern around the margin about what we might be achieving for this coming year.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Okay, and if I could sneak in one another one, reinsurance brokerage showed some improvements, it look like positive pricing, are you guys seeing this as kind of taken some market share or are you seeing beginning to see a change in the market overall?", "John Haley", "I think we\u2019re seeing a bit of a change in the tone in the market I think is the way we would characterize it Shlomo. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to proclaim that it\u2019s a definite sea change at this moment, but it could be the beginning, we might look back later and say may be this was the beginning.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "All right. Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Please proceed.", "Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Yes, thank you. First I wanted to ask about Investment Services business, can you talk a little bit more about what\u2019s causing the longer sale cycle and you mentioned that there is a plan to improve it. Can you give a little more color on what you\u2019re going to do this next year?", "John Haley", "Sure, I think that the Investment Services are something that we\u2019re seeing procurement of the services becoming more formalized, and there is a lot more maybe company purchasing, departments etcetera being involved in and then there is just somewhat more who\u2019s people are jumping through to get that. I mean that\u2019s probably leading to somewhat longer sale cycle. We\u2019ve seen a new competitors that maybe, if there is more to choose from, there is a little bit more of that there. I think what our folks had been working on is, one, in making sure that we\u2019re in position to respond quickly and efficiently to some of these extra requests, and also maybe going after some of this ad hoc work a little bit more aggressively than we had in the past.", "Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay. And just in the context you mentioned the macro environment is making you somewhat cautious about the margins, but it sounds like you\u2019re expecting the continuation of a relatively similar revenue growth for what you\u2019re seeing in the last quarter, is there a reason why you\u2019re more confident in the revenue growth sustaining than I guess necessarily and also \u2013 incremental, but at the margin front?", "John Haley", "", "No, I think look, if you look at the last couple of recessions that we\u2019ve had in the early 2000s and then in the 2008 era, what happens is things suffer at the topline and then that will translate into pressure on the margins. So we\u2019ve been talking about the macro environment in the context of the resulting impact on the margins, but it starts at the topline.", "Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay. In the context of the market volatility or at least in the stock markets, I mean, I guess you gave your Q-on-Q guidance, it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019ve seen much of an impact, but can you comment at all in terms of trends in July and in the early half of August here in terms of what you\u2019ve seen from client behavior?", "John Haley", "I think what we\u2019ve seen is that things still continue to be reasonably strong for us and so we feel pretty good about what this first quarter is going to be. I think the concern we have is that in the last couple of months with the turmoil in Europe with the US and the downgrade and everything, those kind of things affect business confidence and business confidence may affect how they\u2019re willing to spend and I think that\u2019s the only caution we\u2019re saying. I don\u2019t think we know anything more than anybody else about that so.", "Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay. And then if I could just slip in one or two number of questions, just Roger you declared the $450 million in available cash that\u2019s netting out some of the reinsurance payable and things like that, is that netting out cash for bonus payment as well or\u2026", "Roger F. Millay", "What that nets out is both the \u2013 and you see it\u2019s aggregated on the balance sheet actually, but the reinsurance payables but also the cash that\u2019s sitting on our captives, our Insurance Captives.", "Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay. And then can you give us a specific number you said, headcount grew slightly I think, what\u2019s your comment?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, I mean it\u2019s like a 100 or 200...", "John Haley", "I think in the quarter it was 200, about 2%, 204 I mean to be precise.", "Timothy McHugh \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of the Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is Frank in for Tobey, I wanted to ask in Talent and Rewards, you mentioned strong performance in Asia-Pacific, how much visibility do you have there? Do you see that continuing and kind of where could that affect margins?", "John Haley", "Yes, I don't think, Talent and Rewards, it's the most cyclical, it's the most project oriented of our segments, and so it\u2019s the one where I think overall we have the least visibility. There are probably different lines of businesses between some of the other segments where we don't have the best visibility either, but overall it\u2019s the segment Talent and Rewards would clearly be the one. I don't think that\u2019s any different in Asia than it is in any other region in the world, but it's just not a segment, it is a very project-based business.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then, kind of going back to the market volatility question over the last month or so, has there been any positive impact on either Investment Services, clients looking at their portfolios or even on their retirement side as people consider it is from work related to the market swings?", "John Haley", "We haven\u2019t seen anything like that. Although to be fair we haven't actually gone and looked at it either. So I can't tell you that didn't occur, but I can tell you it's not something that we\u2019ve had any comments on it at the moment.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great, and maybe one quick numbers question. What do you have baked in for transaction or integration expense for the guidance for the next quarter?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah, we haven't given anything more specific other than the comments I made in my script which are that we expect that over the next several quarters we're going to see it continue to gradually decrease. It has dropped versus the third quarter of fiscal '11 and it\u2019s dropped versus last year. It seems like this range in the low to mid 20s is about where we\u2019re running, but as I said these things tend to be choppy and you can get them spiking up and down, so I think that\u2019s about as precise as we can be.", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "Okay. Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Thanks, good morning, could you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of trends in your U.K. business?", "Roger F. Millay", "We haven\u2019t looked quite honestly, the U.K. specifically of course when we talk about investment services the biggest part of investment is the U.K., so they would be a big driver of the U.K. market. I\u2019m also aware that when we talk about strength in the reinsurance brokerage business our U.K. operation, which really it\u2019s serving clients that are outside the U.K. as well, but that piece is doing well.", "In general, Europe was overall a little bit softer at the end of the year, still growing, but I think there is, I\u2019m not aware of anything specific other than that.", "John Haley", "", "Yeah, I think Roger has captured that correctly, Europe was about where we thought it would be for the quarter and the year, about, but about but a little bit below. And so it\u2019s got a little bit more softness there and I think that is true across most of the segment certainly for benefits and tasks, we saw a little bit softer there.", "Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks and then, just other question about fiscal year 2012 outlook, I know we\u2019ll get more details in about a month or so. But with that 18% to 19% EBITDA margin range, you did mention that you wary of the economic as you\u2019re thinking about that. So I\u2019m wondering is the thought at 18% that things could get a little bit softer than you\u2019re expecting, you need still be able to do that, or that the economy would need to be where it is right now, and if it wasn\u2019t then we would see margins perhaps coming in lower than that?", "John Haley", "I think we probably feel that the economy could get somewhat softer and we\u2019d still be in the 18% to 19% range.", "Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Jeffrey Volshteyn \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Let me also ask about the fiscal 2012 revenue guidance by segment and I know you probably going to be talking about at the Investor Day, but sort of maybe directionally within segments where do you see revenues going on an organic basis?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, so we haven\u2019t, you\u2019re talking for the whole year?", "Jeffrey Volshteyn \u2013 JPMorgan", "Right, right.", "Roger F. Millay", "And so...", "Jeffrey Volshteyn \u2013 JPMorgan", "Within the mid-single digit constant currency revenue sort of outlook?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, I think, we are holding that specific guidance. I mean, I think, we \u2013 John foreshadowed a little bit in some of his remarks with respect to continuing growth in benefits, the hope for some enhanced growth performance in RFS, which had a bit of a tough organic growth year. And I think we\u2019ve been talking quite a bit on the call about the wariness I suppose in Talent and Rewards although right now they are seeing good strength of course as a mark-to-mark cyclical segment, they are also potentially subject to more volatility. With respect to more specific numbers that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be doing in September.", "Jeffrey Volshteyn \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. I appreciate that. When I look at the turnover of associates or any sort of obvious hiring needs within new businesses or with the new geographies where would those be?", "John Haley", "Well I think in Health and Group Benefits, we\u2019ve been doing some hiring, we\u2019ve been doing some hiring in Talent and Rewards, and within Talent and Rewards, I think, particularly in data surveys and technologies, we\u2019ve also done fair amount of hiring, for the year we\u2019ve done a fair amount of hiring in Tax, not so much in the fourth quarter, yeah, driven by eloquent right. And so I think if we look at it though Health and Group Benefits and Talent and Rewards would be the areas.", "Jeffrey Volshteyn \u2013 JPMorgan", "And geographically?", "John Haley", "Its really, well, Health and Group Benefits is largely North America.", "Jeffrey Volshteyn \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay.", "John Haley", "That\u2019s where that is. The Talent and Rewards hiring is really across the globe.", "Jeffrey Volshteyn \u2013 JPMorgan", "It makes sense. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Please proceed.", "Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "", "Thanks. This is actually Tobey in for Frank. I wanted to ask an additional question on the hiring, could you describe the competitive landscape for experienced people, just to get your comment there? Thanks.", "John Haley", "Well, I think this is a market, which is always somewhat competitive or the kind of high performing folks that we are looking at. And so that probably never changes really. I think the value proposition that Towers Watson offers has become a lot clear to people who are in other organizations and I think that has really helped us quite a bit, and the fact that, we\u2019ve gotten through the integration so smoothly and so successfully is something that has, it\u2019s not lost on people and so that's helped our competitive positioning.", "Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Would you characterize the transparency of the compensation formula, as we talk about it, asking about pre-tax profit et cetera, is that a driver for hiring?", "John Haley", "Well, I mean, I think one of the things we\u2019ve done as an organization is to try to be as clear and transparent with our associates about where Rewards come from and how all stakeholders are served by the way we distribute Rewards. And so it's sort of one of the core values we have as an organization, we think that is one of our strengths and we think it helps us a lot, yeah.", "Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks, and then just a question about the tax rate, which geographies were a little bit weaker in the phase of what was little bit better performance out of the higher tax region in the U.S.?", "Roger F. Millay", "I think John mentioned and maybe both of us did, while the U.S. came in quite a bit higher than forecast, Europe did come in a little bit lower, so European countries most part.", "Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Mark S. Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Hi, good morning, I was wondering, as you look out over the next year what sort of legislative changes or regulatory changes, do you see that could potentially be drivers and either the Benefits or in Talent?", "John Haley", "Well, I mean, I think the biggest thing that we could have some interest in and it\u2019s what's going to happen with Healthcare and you\u2019ve got these dueling court cases in the Federal Appeals Courts and potential Supreme Court review of that, you\u2019ve got to talk about whether that pieces of that get included in any of the debt discussions whatever. So I think that's something that is a little bit unsettled, I'm not sure that there is anything we could point to say that we actually think that there is going to be any new legislation or regulation that will for certain occur, but certainly that\u2019s something that could possibly be the case. I don't think there is anything else that we would flag as saying that\u2019s there is a big deal that's on the horizon.", "Mark S. Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay. And how big could that be for this coming year? It seems like by 2013 we\u2019ll have more clarity and then there will be this scramble, but do you think that this year...", "John Haley", "That's right. We probably don't expect to see much resolution in this coming fiscal year or this current fiscal year, I should say, on the healthcare debate, but I just mention that is the only one that we saw up there, that was a big deal.", "Mark S. Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Got it. And then can you talk a little bit about leadership across the organization. You\u2019ve clearly done a great job in terms of integrating the two cultures in the two organizations. Do you feel like at this point the leadership team is set?", "John Haley", "I do. I think one of the attractions for both Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt as we came together was that we would have a \u2013 it\u2019s an enhanced leadership and management team. And I think by bringing them together, and frankly the organization has done a very good job of integrating that management and leadership team together. We just had an event last month with a couple hundred of the most senior folks, and the leadership teams around the world. And I'll tell you, you go to that and you leave thinking that there is nothing this organization can do when you look at the leadership team we have here. So I feel that they\u2019ve really come together well. I think we\u2019re well placed. I mean, I think any organization there is always going to be change, we\u2019ll have people that decide to leave or that people retire that\u2019s one of the dynamism, and it\u2019s a reflection also of a successful organization. But I think this is the best place we've ever been any time in my career and so I feel pretty good about where we are.", "Mark S. Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Great. And then obviously there is a lot of macro uncertainty out there right now. In the possibility that the policymakers get it wrong and miscalculate and we end up having another downturn. Can you talk about the areas where you\u2019ve got some levers to make some adjustments so that we could still do in the 18% to 19% EBITDA range?", "John Haley", "Yes, thanks for bringing the question because I think one of the things that you sometimes get off on these calls is you start talking about a subject that got mentioned and you talk about it a lot and after the call I sometimes think, did we give the impression of we were more concerned about that than we did, just because we got a lot of questions about it and I think we\u2019re may be in danger of happening that we\u2019re just talking about the macro economy.", "We mentioned that it\u2019s just one of the number of factors that we were thinking about that could affect margins there. And I think we have to mention that because its pretty clear that if the macro economy really goes south that does have some impact on how we are going to perform as a company. Frankly it\u2019s not the kind of thing we\u2019re obsessively worried about, if you look at what our organizations did in the 2008 downturn, we probably performed in the top 1% or 2% of all companies in terms of how we handled the downturn, how we handled our margins, and how we kept things up.", "So it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re necessarily afraid of, it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re shirk from, I think that we\u2019re better managed now than we were two or three years ago, and so we can probably doing better job, we\u2019re not going to be immune from it, but I think we know how to run the business and I think we know the kinds of things to do. I think one of the things that we will not do though is we think it\u2019s a bad move to all of a sudden layoff a lot of associates and have them bear the brunt of downturn. We think that\u2019s best done by the company figuring out how to try to get new revenues and tightening our belts in other ways.", "Mark S. Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And you certainly did a great job during the last one. Can you talk also with regard to the $338 million bonus payment that\u2019s coming out, just to clarify, is that a clean full year bonus that will get paid out in September or would it be higher in future years because there was a stub, that was partially paid earlier.", "Roger F. Millay", "No, that\u2019s a clean full year number.", "Mark S. Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay, great. And then the last\u2026", "Roger F. Millay", "", "That\u2019s a good result for us to, so I mean I think it\u2019s a good result for our associates. We\u2019ve had good result for our shareholders, but we\u2019ve had a good result for all of our stakeholders.", "Mark S. Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Right. And then with regards to your pension liability can you talk about the impact from the recent reduction in terms of the outlook for rates over the next two years, as well as the recent market volatility, is that going to have much more impact in terms of just from an accounting perspective how we should think about that?", "Roger F. Millay", "", "Well again the biggest driver of the reduction in liability was in investment results, so we don\u2019t have a forecast on that, but as you\u2019re alluding both investments results as well as movements in discount rates, would have an impact, discount rates really didn\u2019t move all that much from last year so.", "John Haley", "", "Yeah, the big thing was the asset movement and of course if we measure that a few weeks later and there is a difference. So, but I don\u2019t think we have any predictions for what that might be like next June 30.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah and just as a reminder as John just kind of pointed out, I mean we only revalue every year at the end of the year. So we\u2019re locked in now for this fiscal year.", "Mark S. Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Great, I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is (inaudible) for Ashwin, I just want to follow-up on some of the questions related to the margins projections for next year. I was wondering if you could quantify some of the investments that you\u2019re planning on making in terms of the front-end adjustments and then perhaps talk about what the future benefits of those investments would be?", "John Haley", "No, actually, we don\u2019t have anything to say about those, we\u2019ll talk about that at Analyst Day.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then on the synergies related to the IT transition, Roger, is there anything built in for that in fiscal \u201912 or will that be more of a fiscal \u201913 of that?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yeah, it\u2019s more of a fiscal \u201913 impact because as I mentioned really the deployment is, we\u2019ll have deployments at this point planned quarterly as I said earlier for about the next 15 months so it\u2019s more of fiscal \u201913 impact.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then just lastly on the, given the strength of the balance sheet and the cash flow so far, once you get pass the bonus payment in September could we see an accelerated buyback activity from you guys?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, we\u2019re not going to forecast anything other than what we\u2019ve talked about at this point and we continue to look at balancing what we see is potential investment opportunities, particularly acquisitions with other uses of free cash. We have another $50 million or so to go on the $100 million buyback that we had approved a few months ago and we\u2019ll be executing against that and that\u2019s the outlook for the moment.", "John Haley", "It will take us a while to complete that extra $50 million anyway.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Vincent Lin with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Vincent Lin \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Thanks, I just have a follow-up, I think John, you mentioned last quarter you had some under staffing issues, or capacity constraints in Asia, I think within the Talent and Rewards area, has the problem being resolved or what\u2019s the staffing level that you\u2019re seeing right now?", "John Haley", "", "I don\u2019t recall...", "Roger F. Millay", "That may have been coming more in line of opportunity and we might be adding people.", "John Haley", "I think that might have been it, so yeah, that we had opportunity to add folks in Asia-Pacific and could do that. We have been, as I said particularly in Talent and Rewards, which is relatively bigger in Asia-Pacific than say Benefits or something like that. We have been adding folks there. Asia has been a real success story this year. We\u2019ve had a lot of growth and we think that\u2019s going to continue.", "Vincent Lin \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then just, one follow-up, on the mid single digit revenue growth for the full year, that\u2019s constant currency including acquisitions. Is that correct?", "John Haley", "That\u2019s correct.", "Vincent Lin \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Haley for closing remarks.", "John Haley", "", "Okay. Thanks everybody for joining us this morning.

After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Roger. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we will review our results for the first quarter of 2012 and our guidance for the full fiscal year. We are pleased with our results this quarter as we continued to produce growth and maintain our strong margins. Reported revenues for the quarter were $810 million, an increase of 8% over prior year reported revenues and an increase of 5% on a constant currency basis.", "Our organic growth rate, which adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, was 2% for the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $162 million, up 23% from last year and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 20%. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.82 and our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.19.", "Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 29% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share include a normalized income tax rate and exclude non-recurring other income, transaction and integration cost, non-cash stock-based compensation costs from restricted shares issued in conjunction with the merger, and the amortization of merger accounting intangible assets.", "Our results reflect the excellent work of our associates. They are striking the right balance between managing cost and growing the business. Consequently, we are well positioned and prepared for long-term profitable growth. We are the trusted advisor to many of our clients, and in this complicated environment we can offer them practical actionable solutions and advise.", "We just held our annual client conference in Chicago, where we hosted over 300 of our clients. This event is highly rated by our clients every year as we showcase some of our best consulting work, offer clients the opportunity to network with each other and hear about best practices and creative ideas. It is just one example of how we live our value of clients first.", "I think our results reflect the nature of our client relationships and the client first attitude. We remain focused on profitable growth, investing for the future and ensuring we are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities. Now let's take a look at the performance of each of our segments.", "In the face of continued economic uncertainty and in some cases legislative changes, many clients are reviewing their benefit plans to ensure that they are as efficient as possible, and that the plans are communicated effectively to employees. We see this particularly in the Benefits and Talent and Rewards segments.", "All of our segments grew organically this quarter. Benefits grew 2%, Risk and Financial Services 3% and Talent and Rewards grew 2%. Our revenue growth reflects wins from both new and existing clients.", "Turning to Benefits. For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $455 million, including the revenues from Aliquant, which we acquired in late December 2010. Benefits segment revenues were 4% on a constant currency basis. On an organic basis, revenues were up 2%. Retirement, technology and administration solutions and health and group benefits all grew this quarter. Retirement revenues increased 2% on a constant currency basis and were led by growth in North America.", "Additional work with existing clients contributed to the growth. We expect retirement will continue to have low single digit growth. Technology and administration solutions had a very strong quarter with double-digit constant currency growth. Revenues increased in the U.S. due to the acquisition of Aliquant and new client activity. The integration of Aliquant into our U.S. business has gone well and our pipeline continues to look strong.", "We had mid-single digit constant currency growth in health and group benefits this quarter. Growth was driven by an increase in U.S. client demand for some of our high value solutions and healthcare strategy work. We expect continued strong growth in the second quarter.", "Now, let's move on to Risk and Financial Services. For the quarter, the Risk and Financial Services segment had revenues of $194 million. Including EMB, revenues were up 13% on a constant currency basis. Revenues were up 3% on an organic basis. Risk consulting and software revenues continued to benefit from the EMB acquisition and had double-digit constant currency growth. On an organic basis revenues grew in the low single digits. Regulatory changes and M&A activity continued to drive demand.", "We were really pleased to see the growth in brokerage this quarter. Next, let me turn to Talent and Rewards. For the quarter, the Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $140 million. On a constant currency basis, revenues were flat from the prior quarter and were up 2% organically. On an organic basis, revenues increased in executive compensation and rewards, talent and communication.", "Data surveys and technology revenues were lower than expected. We are still projecting strong growth for Talent and Rewards. The Dodd-Frank Bill and other legislative issues continued to drive companies to re-examine their executive compensation plans. Clients are looking for help navigating legislative changes and ensuring that their compensation programs are aligned with both new rules and their company's strategic objectives. ", "We continue to see strong activity in Asia Pacific as well. Revenues increased in all regions for rewards, talent and communication. We are seeing strong activity around preparations for the annual benefits open enrollment period. Companies are focused on helping their employees understand the value of their health and benefit packages which requires communication expertise.", "We have won business with new clients and have increased the scope of services performed with existing clients. Overall, we continue to see good opportunities in this segment and we are forecasting continued solid growth in the second quarter, given our projects already underway and in the pipeline. This business is traditionally the most vulnerable to changes in the economy, but at this time we are not seeing signs of client\u2019s significantly cutting their budgets.", "Finally, for the firm overall, we remain optimistic about continuing our momentum for the next quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year. Now, I will turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks John. As John mentioned we continued our strong business performance this quarter. We continued to deliver top line growth with a very healthy increase in operating earnings. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was above our expectation and 20%. I should note that we had a professional liability insurance reserve adjustment that contributed about one point of that margin.", "The top line revenue growth translated into good segment margins as well. As a reminder our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs. Such as, amortization of intangibles resulting from merger accounting and transaction and integration costs.", "The benefits segment had a 32% NOI margin for the quarter. Risk and Financial Services had a 26% margin for the quarter, and Talent and Rewards had an 18% margin. Net income attributed to controlling interest for the quarter was $60 million. Excluding transaction and integration costs, non-cash stock-based compensation arising from the merger, the amortization of merger accounting intangible assets, non-recurring other income and in this quarter we had $21 million of transaction and integration cost versus $23 million last quarter and $18 million in last year\u2019s first quarter.", "As we have mentioned before, these costs are choppy and difficult to precisely predict quarter to quarter. But we still expect to see a gradually slowing trend over the next year. This quarter the majority of the costs related to our large IT initiatives, integration both the ERP software and hardware platforms of the company. We are continuing with the global deployment phases of these projects.", "We also had some real estate and HR related cost this quarter. Although, not at the level of last quarter. The normalized tax rate for the quarter was 37%. If the fiscal year \u201812 geographical mix is consistent with fiscal year \u201911, we continue to expect the normalized tax rate to be in the range of 37% to 38% for the fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.82, an increase from $0.45 last year, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.19, up 29% versus last year.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continued to have a very strong financial position. We ended the quarter with about $284 million of cash that is available for our use. We have $75 million of borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter. We still have $100 million of notes plus accrued interest payable to B1 shareholders, due in March 2012, from the tender offer that was completed in June 2010.", "We have now repurchased about 1.2 million shares under our $100 million repurchase authorization, and used about 75% of the authorization. Now let\u2019s review our guidance for fiscal year 2012. Overall, we continue to expect revenue to fall in the range of $3.4 billion $3.5 billion. We are increasing our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.95 to $5.10., and exclude transaction and integration costs, non-cash stock-based compensation costs from restricted shares issued in conjunction with the merger, and the amortization of merger accounting intangible assets.", "Our adjusted measures of income also exclude non-recurring other income. For the fiscal year, our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of 1.60 U.S. dollars to the British pound and an average exchange rate of 1.40 U.S. dollars to the euro. We expect to have a normalized income tax rate of 37% to 38% and diluted shares outstanding of about 73 million. We expected GAAP diluted earnings per share (audio gap).", "Now we will review our fiscal year guidance for the segments. We expect revenues in the Benefits segment to grow in the low to mid single digits on a constant currency basis. And our range is 2% to 5%. We expect organic growth will be led by health and group benefits. The NOI margin for benefits is expected to be in the low 30% range.", "Next, in the Risk and Financial Services segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth will be in the range of 8% to 12% for the fiscal year. This guidance includes revenue from EMB. We expect the NOI margin to be in the mid-20% range. Lastly, in the Talent and Rewards segment, we have lowered our revenue forecast slightly in light of the first quarter results are now forecasting constant currency growth of 5% to 8% for the fiscal year.", "We expect the NOI margin to be about 20%. We are cognizant of several variables that could impact our performance including the challenges of our systems implementation and potential headwinds from the macro environment. But as of now our pipelines are strong and the business is performing very well. Overall, I am very pleased with our performance for the quarter.", "Finally, I am pleased to announce our new Head of Investor Relations, Aida Sukys. Aida has been a strong leader in Towers Watson finance business operations for many years. She knows our business well and is a pleasure to work with. She will gradually transition to the IR role beginning in January.", "Now I will turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks, John. We are excited about our opportunities for growth and our continued strong results. Now we will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Volshteyn of JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Jeffrey Volshteyn - JPMorgan", "Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. The first question has to do with expenses, specifically employee expenses came in quite a bit lower than we expected. Roger, I think you mentioned changes in professional liability insurance. Can you talk about, is that the only explanation or are there other reasons?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I will say that -- I think you are dealing with two things. So the professional liability expense is related to claims that we have for professional liability and so those are reserves that go up and down quarter-to-quarter, I think we have highlighted that as an element of volatility since we did the merger. And you may recall that, I think it was in the March quarter, we talked about a couple of claims that settled. As a result of that just some of the projections of future liabilities and what they call incurred but not reported claims have come down. That\u2019s separate from an employee matter, so that\u2019s what I was referring to there. And you see actually in the cash flow statement, both the impact of the payment of claims and then on the balance sheet you see the reserves, the overall reserve level coming down. So that\u2019s that matter.", "On the employee cost level, I am not sure -- of course I can't really answer why it\u2019s lower then what you had projected but I think overall we had talked about adding people. We did add people in the quarter. Roughly 400 or so folks. Perhaps that addition came in a little more slowly, I don\u2019t know, but we have added people. Costs actually were a little bit lower overall then we had projected which was a part of the EBITDA margin out performance as well.", "Jeffrey Volshteyn - JPMorgan", "Thanks, that\u2019s really helpful. But when I look at discretionary comp, that went up to sort of 41%. Is that the new level -- it\u2019s up from sort of 34% in the last couple of quarters. How should we think about discretionary comp going forward?", "Roger Millay", "I mean, I think that there will be some movement in the discretionary comp levels probably, but this is kind of getting towards the upper 30s as a percent of pre-bonus operating income is about where we expect it to be.", "Jeffrey Volshteyn - JPMorgan", "Nice. Thank you.", "Roger Millay", "I\u2019m sorry, did you say 41, it was 39%, I believe, our pre-bonus operating income.", "Jeffrey Volshteyn - JPMorgan", "I\u2019ll double check. Yeah. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that data survey and technology within Talent and Rewards was below your expectations. Can you give us some more color on that and how you think it will trend over the next couple of quarters?", "John Haley", "Yeah, sure. So, I think there\u2019s two things that were responsible for that. One is HR technology which is a piece of that. It was lower. We were waiting for the release of Talent|REWARD version 7.0 to ramp up our selling efforts. So that I think delayed things a little bit.", "In addition, some of the surveys that are typically delivered in this quarter have been delayed due to longer than expected data collection cycles with some of the clients who have been participating there. So I think we have some timing around the surveys. We expect that we will get most of that back as we go through the year.", "Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then what\u2019s your guidance for the second quarter? Are you expecting a pickup in organic revenue trends, for most segments?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, we are expecting a bit of a pickup. So we think that, particularly John just mentioned in what we call DST or data, surveys and technology, we think that will be stronger next quarter, particularly given the timing matters that John mentioned. We also think that the Health and Group Benefits business particularly, will be stronger in the next quarter. So we are expecting a pickup.", "Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just last question. On the share buybacks that you did, were they open market purchases or was it in anyway related to the lock-up expiration, and if you can share any thoughts that you have around the coming lock-up expiration in January?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, they were open market purchases under both the programs that we execute, which is to offset dilution as well as the $100 million program that was authorized earlier this year. Going forward, right now, we don\u2019t have any particular initiatives that we are planning on, relative to lock-up exercise. We are pleased with how that\u2019s gone this year, and again at the moment for the lock-up coming in -- or the unlock coming in January, don\u2019t have any specific plans in place, given that we have managed through that quite well so far.", "John Haley", "Yeah, January 2011 went by without a hitch there. And so we are going to continue to monitor this situation but we don\u2019t have any plans in place right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Two things. You mentioned legislative changes driving some of your revenue. Was that in your Risk and Financial Services division around risk consulting software, is that what you were talking about or there\u2019s some other changes also driving it?", "John Haley", "Risk and Financial Services or the risk consulting is driven by some of the Solvency II. But I don\u2019t think that was what we were really referring to. We\u2019re thinking more things like Dodd-Frank.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then could you go back to that liability adjustment, where will we see that in the P&L, is there any way to -- can you size that?", "Roger Millay", "For the professional liability?", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Correct.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, it\u2019s in the general and administrative costs. I mean it\u2019s not big enough to pop out as a separate item, but that\u2019s where it is.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Great. And John, if I can sneak one more in. There was some recent -- an article about how Solvency II in the U.K. is driving demand for actuaries. Is that causing any issues hiring people or is that driving up rates and underlying salaries?", "John Haley", "Well, I think that that phenomenon has been there for a while and we probably experienced it a little more last year. But I think it\u2019s still hard to find good actuarial talent. There is probably more of a demand for that in Europe and the U.K. than there has been for a while. But we\u2019re pleased with the group we had, and we think we are well positioned to take advantage of Solvency II.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair. Please proceed.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company", "Hi, guys. First, I wanted to ask about the new ERP system you\u2019re implementing this year. Can you give us an update on, I guess, how that\u2019s going and how the costs are tracking relative to what you expected?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I think in general we\u2019re on track. As I said, we\u2019re continuing with the deployments. I think we may have mentioned earlier at the analyst meeting that this is a staged deployment with six or so stages over the next few quarters. And we\u2019re preparing -- we did the pilot in Canada and are now preparing to rollout in the U.S. and then after that we\u2019ll be moving over to Europe. So it\u2019s a very active program. The costs are generally in the neighborhood and again we showed you those in the analyst meeting, generally in the neighborhood of where we expected. And we\u2019ll keep pushing forward here.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company", "Okay. And then can I ask about the data surveys and HR technology. It seems like you attributed that mostly to timing issues, but I think you also said you lowered kind of your organic growth assumptions for the Talent and Rewards segment for the year. I guess why -- is there another factor in there or you are just trying to be conservative given the Q1 number. Can you talk a little about that?", "John Haley", "Well, I think we lowered the Talent and Rewards about 1% overall. So we think that there is probably a little bit that we won\u2019t get back, but we think it\u2019s mostly timing.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company", "Okay. And then lastly can I ask, even if we adjust for the professional liability, your margins seem to expand pretty nicely year-over-year. And I think, again, even if we adjust that, it seems like your full year margin guidance is in line with Q1 which I normally think of as a seasonally weaker margin quarter then I guess relative to some of the others. So I guess are there any other factors? Any costs that would, I guess, are you going to pick up spending somewhere? I guess just kind of talk about the Q1 performance versus what you\u2019re expecting from margins for the rest of the year.", "Roger Millay", "Sure. I think there are two principal things to think about there. One is that, October 1, is our merit increase date. So salaries went up at that point. Also, I mentioned that we hired about 400 people during the quarter, so the full rate of that will come in in the next quarter. So, of course the trick with both of those is matching that to revenues, but we do think that this -- around 19% rate as we mentioned, we did increase the guidance, of course, for the EBITDA margin for the year that it\u2019s a reasonable level for the year.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company", "Okay. Can you give the -- what is the quarter-end headcount?", "Roger Millay", "Quarter-end total headcount. Actually we\u2019ll pull that number, I don\u2019t have it right in from of me. And we\u2019ll...", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company", "The 400, the net number, is that correct or is that a growth?", "Roger Millay", "400 was the increase during the quarter. Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Good morning, guys. I wanted to check in couple of things real quickly. So just on the P&L impact of the special liability adjustment. It sounds like you said that was one point benefit to EBITDA, and just to confirm, all that was in your G&A line? Is that correct?", "Roger Millay", "Yes.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Got it. Great. And then, going back to sort of the pricing environment. Is there a way that you maybe just across the three major segments, talk a little bit about pricing and pricing leverage you are seeing by segment?", "John Haley", "I don\u2019t think the pricing situation has really changed at all this quarter. I mean, I think we continue to see an environment where clients are reasonably price sensitive and we feel comfortable competing in that environment.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. But no significant callouts in terms of incremental pricing pressure or even leverage to the upside in terms of...?", "John Haley", "No, I don\u2019t think there is anything that\u2019s changed this quarter from, say, the last several quarters or in the last year.", "Roger Millay", "I guess, the only thing we\u2019d note, right, that we haven\u2019t talked about is in brokerage business turn. Again, things have seemed to turn and are progressing positively as opposed to a year ago, where we were kind of holding a negative trend. But that\u2019s a little different than the consulting business that I think John was mainly referring to.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Understood. And then just kind of thinking, stepping back and kind of thinking about post the merger here, and thinking about the upside in the margins and the way that you guys have progressed. I think your initial target was somewhere in the 16 to 17 range, obviously we are moving way ahead of that as kind of where we stand now. If we think about room related to the kind of post-merger versus incremental sources of earnings, where is that source right now, in terms of what\u2019s really driving the upside for you guys? Is it just finding better cost savings after the merger, or are there other sources of earnings that you guys have gone through this merger now that are paying better sort of results as we sort of go through the process here?", "Roger Millay", "I am not sure I fully -- I\u2019ll answer first, I think John has got a comment too. But I think in terms of what we are -- if the question was really in essence what are we getting the enhancement from now in margins, I think a part of that is the success that we have had on the growth front. Again, about a year ago, we were talking about having some incremental capacity and I think as I said earlier, costs went up less than we expected this quarter and the revenues were pretty close to about what we expected. So I think we are getting a little bit more leverage out of the system.", "John Haley", "And I think the other part of your question maybe is longer run, what would see as the margin growth. And I think as we have said in prior quarters, we are not necessarily even looking for margins to expand in the future. I think what we would like to target is, maybe top line revenue growth a little bit more, and trying to get that up, and maintaining our margins.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer of SunTrust. Please proceed.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us some context for the hiring that you executed in the quarter, up 400. How does that compare to recent quarters, and is that a pace that you feel is sustainable for the next couple of quarters?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I think it\u2019s been a bit more than the last couple of quarters and again we\u2019ve been foreshadowing it, I think for a while. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a pace. I think our expectation for the next quarter is actually a little bit lower than that. But we are -- and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed that much in the areas where we\u2019ve seen opportunity, particularly in Talent Rewards, in the health and group benefits business, areas where we see opportunity we\u2019ve been adding people and we\u2019ll continue to monitor that. But it\u2019s not really a strong across the board for us, so I wouldn\u2019t expect a big change in that momentum.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Could you give us some color on that 400 you described, I figure is a net number? What the gross adds and losses look like, any changes to kind of voluntary attrition in recent period?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. Again, I don\u2019t have the voluntary -- that\u2019s pretty -- we can talk about that, I suppose separately, but I really don\u2019t have that in front of me. The other color I do have is, from a business breakdown point of view, it was driven by areas like Talent Rewards, RCS as well as the technology business and some in health and group benefits as well. So, again, in areas where we see some growth coming.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Okay. And I guess my last -- because we heard from you from the analyst day not too long ago, but where do -- could you give us an update as to the M&A opportunities that you\u2019re seeing? Any changes either for the positive or the negative, relative to a few months ago?", "Roger Millay", "As far as our opportunities in M&A?", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Correct. Thank you.", "Roger Millay", "Well, I think -- and again I am sure John will want to comment on this area, I think we do as we -- I don\u2019t think much has changed since the analyst meeting. It is one of our three key strategic growth initiatives and we think there are likely to be opportunities that are close to the core, as well as some areas that perhaps will not be dramatically new but adjacent to the core.", "John Haley", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s right, (inaudible). I think it\u2019s something we are always interested in looking at and it is one of our growth initiatives. I think the one thing that I would say is that we\u2019re focused on -- and we talked a little bit about this at the analyst meeting -- is taking a more proactive approach. And I think we\u2019ve had good disciplined approach as to acquisitions generally but we have maybe not been quite as proactive as we\u2019d like to in sort of prioritizing what they are and making sure that when anything came along we were well prepared for it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. How much did Aliquant contribute during the quarter?", "John Haley", "", "I think they are about $8 million of -- for the quarter.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. (inaudible). ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And so when I take a look at the Benefits and I take a look at the estimate for the second quarter in terms of the constant currency growth rate. On an organic basis, is that basically around the same level or is that slightly accelerating?", "Roger Millay", "It\u2019 slightly accelerating. Again, we think health and group benefits will be -- principally, will be stronger in the next quarter.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. ", "John Haley", "We\u2019re projecting retirement and technology and administration solutions about the same.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Got it. And then in terms of that professional liability adjustment, which division did that predominantly go into? Was it equally balanced or -- I\u2019m assuming it wasn\u2019t.", "Roger Millay", "You mean like the underlying. So here is how it works, right. You get a claim that would obviously relate to the business and relate to a particular line of business.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Right.", "Roger Millay", "The overall reserves in the incurred but not reported reserves are done in the aggregate through actuarial calculations.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Sure.", "Roger Millay", "So I suppose we could dig in and isolate movements, but I have to tell you that I didn\u2019t really do that. So the experience has been good recently. We\u2019ve settled some claims and those settlements have not been offset by significant new claims and that\u2019s what generally, over time, leads to lower reserve balances.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Is there a possibility for more along those lines?", "Roger Millay", "Well, this is kind of highlights, if you remember. I don\u2019t know, it might have been when we announced the merger we said that with the consolidation of PCIC that we expected more volatility in this area and this illustrates that. There could be more. It will over time cause the medium term, the reserves will move with the experience. So, extended periods of low claims activity will push the reserve balance down and new claims over time would push it up. And so, again, it illustrates why we have highlighted some volatility. It is unlikely to be totally steady for a long period of time.", "John Haley", "Yeah. But it won\u2019t necessarily all be in one direction.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Right. Got it. And just to go back and make sure I understand completely, the commentary around the margins on a longer-term basis. It sounds like we should still get some savings from the ERP system being fully put in place, you still have some real estate synergies that you could experience. In terms of the commentary around the margins staying relatively constant on a go-forward basis, are we to assume then that the -- whatever savings we end up getting from those other elements are going to get reinvested in terms of growth initiatives?", "John Haley", "I think, as I was responding to that question earlier, I wasn\u2019t trying to make a statement necessarily about what we\u2019re doing. But I was just -- I think the question was, what did we see as the drivers of the upside, and while we do see some potential drivers there, we have also said, if we can look for investments in the business that will grow the top line we would prefer to do it. So we are not -- we\u2019re going to continue with that. We don\u2019t want to see our margins go down at all, but if we see opportunities to invest some margin improvement in business growth, we are going to do that too. I don\u2019t think we are prepared to say exactly how that\u2019s going to unfold from year-to-year.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "I see. But, I mean, the margins could still continue to move up a little bit?", "John Haley", "Yeah, they could.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "All right. And what are the areas -- when you look longer term, what are the areas where you feel like there is the real potential to increase the revenue growth rates? Say in 2013-2014, as you look longer term?", "John Haley", "I mean, I think we\u2019re excited about Talent and Rewards as we mentioned at the analyst meeting and we do believe that that\u2019s an area that we\u2019ll see significant growth over say the, over the medium term here. I think generally RFS, we feel the same way. We feel the same way about healthcare. We don\u2019t think -- we continue to say retirement and probably the technology administration solutions. We expect Retirement to probably be a low single-digit growth and technology administration solutions maybe a little bit higher than that. But the growth will come we think disproportionately from Talent and Rewards and Risk and Financial Services.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Great. And then can you just comment a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in your European markets. Just in terms of commentary either around the austerity measures or around some of the macro uncertainty that exists out there. And what sort of implications does that have for some of the actuarial work that you do?", "John Haley", "Yeah. So it\u2019s something that, we keep an eye on this, and I think it\u2019s a situation that is probably susceptible to sharper turns in a short period of time then maybe we\u2019ve seen in the past. But for the moment the business seems to be pretty good. I think one of the things that helps us, if you look at it where our strength is located, it tends to be in northern part of Europe. So we\u2019re strong in the U.K., Netherlands, Germany, not necessarily the countries that are experiencing the difficulties.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please proceed.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. John, organic growth in the quarter was 2%, yet the year\u2019s guidance is more of a 4% to 7%. So just want to ask you, how much of the increase as we go on or is some of the timing and maybe what other tricks you might have up your sleeve over there.", "John Haley", "Yeah, I don\u2019t know about tricks up my sleeve, Shlomo, but I think as we think about it, look the Talent and Rewards is one that we think is going to have pretty good growth rates for the year and it was lower this quarter. And so we do think timing was a significant part of what happened this quarter. Although, as Roger said, we did lower the overall growth rate about a percentage point or so. But we still felt reasonably confident about getting into that range there. Risk and Financial Services has continued to have good growth.", "As Roger said we do expect health and group benefits to grow faster over the rest of the year than it grew this quarter. Now it was in the mid-single digits and if you look at health and group benefits, it\u2019s actually -- the growth rates have bounced around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, and it probably reflects this is a bit of a project business and they do fluctuate like that. I think the one thing that we\u2019ve been feeling very good about is that we haven\u2019t seen any margin fluctuation really in health and group benefits as that. But we do -- we\u2019re not -- I don\u2019t think in general we\u2019re projecting anything like magic changes overall in what\u2019s going to happen. We just think that the major thing is we think Talent and Rewards will be better than the rest of the year.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "You\u2019re still expecting improvements in the other businesses as well, right? The other businesses were 2% to 3%, the guidance is on a\u2026", "John Haley", "Yes, we are expecting them to be a little bit better.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. And then one other thing that I found most interesting at the analyst day was the ventures part of the business where you\u2019re trying to go ahead and come out with new products or quantify some of the work that you guys have done. Can you give us an update on what\u2019s going on over there?", "John Haley", "Well, we\u2019ve been working at that. This is an area where we said we\u2019d like to look for maybe an external hire to bring in to help us -- help bring some learning in and help run that part of the operation. We\u2019ve been out interviewing some folks and I think we\u2019re reasonably close to making a decision in hiring somebody on that. So I think we\u2019ve made good progress there. We have gotten some proposals for investments from different areas of the business. We had about half a dozen of those come in and make presentation to Roger and me, and some other members of a committee we\u2019ve set up to do that. That was just last week and so we\u2019ll be evaluating those over the coming month.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Then can you just talk a little bit more about the strength in the retirement business. You talked about communications. Is there anything else going on in that business with U.S. government signaling that there is going to be low interest rates for an extended period of time. Are companies going ahead and reassessing what they need to do in terms of the asset side of the balance sheet?", "John Haley", "Yeah. In general, for retirement, what we would say if you look over a longer period of time, significant changes in regulation were probably the biggest growth driver, but there really aren\u2019t any on the horizon right now. The other thing you might look at is plan design changes which can also create additional project work for us, but in this economic environment that\u2019s not something that many companies are doing. The current projects tend to be related to the following activities as; one would be financial management and cost management. Second would be evaluation of hybrid plan alternatives and then third would be harmonization of accounting rules. Those are mostly where we are seeing people look out right now.", "Roger Millay", "And just to clarify, Shlomo, the comment which I think was in the script about communications--", "John Haley", "It was in Talent and Rewards.", "Roger Millay", "", "Talent and Rewards, yeah.", "", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. Very good. And then just lastly, just in terms of the integration costs. When do you think that these costs are going to kind of run their course and we\u2019re going to start looking a lot more towards the GAAP numbers?", "Roger Millay", "Well, we have always said that we targeted three years for integration and that\u2019s the period that we\u2019d have these accounting, kind of this accounting segregation of integration costs. As we looked at this year, a lot does depend on the momentum in these systems initiatives. So depending on the deployment track, and we are planning larger locations, I mentioned the U.S. for the earlier deployments. And as those deployments happen, again, both on the software and the hardware side, integration costs will start to come down. So we expect that when we look back at the four quarters of this fiscal year, the average will be, you will see some decrease in kind of the average quarter-to-quarter and then when we get into the beginning of fiscal year \u201813, I would expect the costs should be quite a bit lower.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please proceed.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Thank you. I guess my first question is, the improvement in pricing in brokerage. Does that tend to hit the beginning of the calendar year, January, so it would be more of a 3Q event. Is that accurate?", "John Haley", "Well, there are two main times. One is July 1 renewals and the other is January 1 renewals.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay. And so can you comment on the level and sustainability of the improved pricing, I\u2019m certainly picking up from other brokerage houses as well, that could be low to mid single-digits. Would that be accurate?", "John Haley", "Yeah, I think Ashwin, that\u2019s what we hear in the market. I mean as a practical matter, the forces that set the pricing are really a lot of these things around, what are the losses and what\u2019s the financial situation for these large companies. So it\u2019s not anything that we have any real control over. But I think that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019re hearing from folks.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay. And not specific to the 400 people you hired, but just generally speaking, what kind of a lag do you tend to have between hiring and revenue generation?", "John Haley", "It depends on the particular business and it probably depends on the particular cycle. But its several months is what we would really would think about, maybe more on the line of -- its three to six months, somewhere in there.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Great. Just a couple more. One is, everyone seems so focused on cost savings and synergies, but lately, isn\u2019t revenue productivity also a good source of margin improvement? I mean a lot of this might depend, improve margins might even depend on how the investments pan out. So as the year progress, we could actually see better margins but you just have to wait and see?", "John Haley", "Well, I mean, I think that\u2019s always possible. We certainly wouldn\u2019t -- we wouldn\u2019t turn our noses up at that.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "Okay. And last question, why not proactively use the balance sheet to buyback stock here?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I think it goes to our standard answer of how we deploy free cash and when it goes back to, in my mind, when we first talked about why the merger really was exciting and that was the strategic opportunities. So again, the first thing we think about in financial flexibility is having the flexibility to optimally invest in the growth opportunities that we see on the horizon. I think we talked about a few of those on the call here. I think we have been active as a share repurchaser. We\u2019ve also been active in increasing the dividend. But we like the kind of lower leverage levels we run at to give flexibility, particularly for growth.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup", "", "Okay. Fair enough. I will just look for an update as we go along the year. Good quarter, guys.", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question is a follow-up from Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Just a quick question on the salaries and employee benefits. Between the 400 people that are going to be added along with the merit increases that went in effect on October 1. Roughly speaking, how much of an increase should we see on that line?", "Roger Millay", "I have to be honest, I don\u2019t have a forecast of front of me. I mean we\u2019re expecting -- it\u2019s not a step change from our point of view.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "That\u2019s primarily what I was getting at, Roger, is just trying to ascertain whether or not it\u2019s a step change or not?", "John Haley", "Yeah, I think, Mark, one way to think about this is that we\u2019ve had the October 1 pay increase cycle that goes back for years.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Sure.", "John Haley", "Everything is on a consistent basis here.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions in the queue and I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. John Haley for closing remarks. Please proceed, sir.", "John Haley", "Okay. Thank you all for joining us this morning, and we look forward to reviewing our second quarter results with you in February.

Please proceed.", "Ida Suches", "Thank you, Karissa.  Good morning.  This is Ida Suches, Director of Investor Relations at Towers Watson.  Welcome to the Towers Watson Earnings call.  I\u2019m here today with John Haley, Towers Watson\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer.  Please refer to our website for this morning\u2019s press release.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except as required by federal securities laws.  After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the conference call for your questions.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Ida.  Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us.  Today we\u2019ll review our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "We\u2019re very pleased with our results this quarter as we continued to produce strong growth with increased margins.  Reported revenues for the quarter were $880 million, an increase of 11% over prior year reported revenues and an increase of 10% on a constant currency basis.  Our organic growth rate, which adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures was 6% for the quarter.  Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $172 million, up 16% from last year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 19.5%.  Adjusted EBITDA excludes transaction and integration costs as well as non-cash stock-based compensation arising from the merger.  ", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.92 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.35.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 22% over the prior year.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share included normalized income tax rate and exclude non-recurring other income transaction and integration costs, non-cash stock-based compensation costs from restricted shares issued in conjunction with the merger, and the amortization of merger accounting intangible assets.  ", "These results underscore the excellent work of our associates and our focus on marketplace opportunities.  All of our segments delivered revenue growth above our expectations for this quarter.  Staying close to our clients, understanding the complexities of the business environment, and delivering practical solutions have driven our results.  Our results also speak to the strong business acumen of our management team throughout the organization.  They are delivering top-line growth while carefully leveraging investments, and that has driven our margin growth.  I\u2019m confident that the depth of our talent pool, adhering to our management principles, and living the client-first values positions and prepares us for long-term profitable growth.", "Now let\u2019s look at the performance of each of our segments.  All of our segments grew organically this quarter.  Benefits grew 5%, risk and financial services 4%, and talent and rewards grew 15%; and revenue growth reflects wins from both new and existing clients.  For the quarter, the benefits segment has revenues of $476 million.  Including the revenues from Aliquant which we acquired in late December 2010, benefits segment revenues were up 7% on a constant currency basis.  ", "On an organic basis, revenues were up 5%.  Retirement, technology, and administration solutions and health and group benefits all grew this quarter.  Retirement revenues increased 3% on a constant currency basis led by growth in North America with growth in our pension administration work from new clients and demand for our strategic work.  We expect retirement will continue to have low single-digit growth.  ", "Technology and administration solutions had a very strong quarter with double-digit constant currency growth.  The revenue increases were in large part due to the acquisition of Aliquant.  Additional growth resulted from demand for system modifications and new call center clients.  ", "The integration of Aliquant into our U.S. business has gone well.  This is the last quarter the year-over-year comparisons will exclude Aliquant in the organic results.  We expect future growth in the mid-single digits.", "We had low double-digit constant currency growth in health and group benefits this quarter.  Growth was driven by an increase in U.S. client demand for strategy work such as plan management and product sales.  The environment for health benefits consulting continues to be strong with regulatory uncertainty, market change and cost pressure.  We expect to continue to deliver strong growth for the foreseeable future with constant currency increases averaging in the upper single digits.", "Now let\u2019s move on to risk and financial services.  For the quarter, the risk and financial services segment had revenues of $205 million.  Including EMB, revenues were up 18% on a constant currency basis.  Revenues were up 4% on an organic basis. We\u2019re very pleased that Towers Watson Risk Consulting and Software won the Transaction of the Year Award in the 2011 Insurance Day London\u2019s market award for the acquisition of EMB.  The award recognizes the synergy between Towers Watson and EMB as well as the business opportunities created by the acquisition, particularly in the London insurance market.", "Risk consulting and software continues to benefit from the EMB acquisition and had 25% constant currency revenue growth.  We acquired EMB about a year ago and are pleased with the integration.  As we hoped, EMB provided additional capabilities which are now paying off in the marketplace, particularly the strong P&C software offerings.  Also, regulatory changes and M&A activity continue to drive demand in RCS.", "We were really pleased to see the continued trend of growth in brokerage this quarter.  Brokerage had mid-single digit growth and grew in both Europe and the Americas.  New business and favorable pricing conditions contributed to the growth this quarter.", "Investment services led organic segment growth due to solid demand worldwide for advice on investment strategy, delegated services, and alternative assets.  Second quarter growth was in the low double digits and we expect strong growth to continue in the second half of the year, particularly in North America and Asia.  We expect solid growth to continue in RFS led by risk consulting and software and the capabilities they\u2019ve added through EMB.", "Next let me turn to talent and rewards.  For the quarter, the talent and rewards segment had revenues of $169 million.  On a constant currency basis, revenues increased by 14%.  All lines of business saw revenue growth this quarter \u2013 executive compensation, rewards talent and communication, and data surveys and technology.  The executive compensation consulting environment continues to be strong globally.  In the U.S. and Europe, we continue to see opportunities consulting to both boards and management.  Continued focus on aligning pay and performance, increasing focus on risk mitigation, and efforts to gauge shareholders\u2019 opinion have driven demand for our services.", "Executive compensation, particularly at the board level, is less prone to economic influences than other parts of the talent and rewards segment.  Constant currency revenue growth for rewards talent and communication was in the mid-single digits.  The Americas drove growth, benefiting from strong client demand.  Revenues were soft in Europe mainly due to weakness on the Continent; however, the U.K.\u2019s pipeline is good and we anticipate growth for EMEA and other regions for the balance of the year.", "As expected, data surveys and technology led this segment with double-digit constant currency revenue growth in all regions.  We delivered the bulk of our compensation benchmarking surveys this quarter, resolving the timing issues that we mentioned in last quarter\u2019s call, and successfully completed our first delivery cycle for our consolidated Towers Watson offering.  ", "Overall, we continue to see good opportunities in talent and rewards.  While this business is traditionally the most vulnerable to changes in the economy and there are some pockets of softness, we have not seen an overall slowdown in demand; therefore, we\u2019re forecasting high single-digit growth for the balance of the year.", "In conclusion, we\u2019re very pleased with our results this quarter and especially pleased with the terrific job our associates do every day.  They not only serve the needs of our clients today but also keep a close watch on the business environment so that they\u2019re positioned to serve our clients\u2019 needs in the future.  I continue to be very optimistic about our future prospects.", "Before turning the call over to Roger, I\u2019d like to note that Towers Watson has been named one of America\u2019s greatest brands for 2011 by the American Brands Council.  Our company and 45 other top brands were selected out of 600 different U.S. companies.  This is quite an honor given that our brand is relatively new in the marketplace.  This is another testament to our consultants who demonstrate our brand values in the marketplace each and every day.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks, John.  As John mentioned, our business really delivered this quarter and we significantly outpaced our own expectations.  We continued to post top-line growth with a very healthy increase in operating earnings.  Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 19.5%.  ", "Our revenue growth translated into good segment margins as well.  As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger accounting and transaction and integration costs.  ", "The benefits segment had a 34% NOI margin for the quarter.  Risk and financial services had a 26% margin and talent and rewards had a 33% margin for the quarter.  Net income attributable to controlling interest for the quarter was $67 million.  Excluding transaction and integration costs, non-cash stock-based compensation arising from the merger, the amortization of merger accounting intangible assets, non-recurring other income, and assuming a normalized income tax rate, adjusted net income was $98 million.", "This quarter we had $23 million of transaction and integration costs versus 21 million last quarter and $31 million in last year\u2019s second quarter.  As we\u2019ve mentioned before, these costs are difficult to forecast precisely quarter-to-quarter but we still expect to see a gradually slowing trend in these costs over the next year.", "In the second quarter, we had a several million dollar one-time settlement cost of a non-compete issue with an affiliate of one of our legacy companies that is included in integration expenses.  Otherwise, the majority of the costs continue to be related to our large IT initiatives, integrating both the ERP software and hardware platforms of the Company.  We have now successfully launched the new Oracle ERP system in Canada and the United States and are moving on with the global deployment that will continue for about another 12 months.", "During our analyst day event in September, we presented a range of $75 million to $105 million for the completion of the transaction and integration costs.  We now believe we\u2019ll be at the higher end of this range.", "The normalized tax rate for the quarter was 36%.  If the fiscal year \u201912 geographic mix of income is consistent with fiscal year \u201911, we expect the normalized tax rate to be approximately 37% for the fiscal year.", "Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.92, up 42% from $0.65 last year.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.35, up 22% versus last year.  The Company clearly continues to execute our integration and growth strategy very successfully.", "During the quarter, we recorded a non-recurring gain of $2.5 million related to the increase in the carrying value of our investment in Fifth Quadrant, our joint venture in South Africa.  Towers Watson acquired an additional 11% interest in Fifth Quadrant for a total of 51% ownership, and we now include Fifth Quadrant in our consolidated financials.  This gain was not included in adjusted net income.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a very strong financial position.  As of December 31, we had $306 million in cash available for our use.  We had $65 million of borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter.  We still have $100 million of notes plus accrued interest payable to the former B1 shareholders due in March 2012 from the tender offer that was completed in June 2010.  As of mid-January, we completed the remainder of our $100 million repurchase authorization, repurchasing a total of 1.64 million shares of Class A stock over the life of the authorization.", "Now let\u2019s review our guidance for the fiscal year 2012.  Given the recent decline in the British pound and the euro, we\u2019ve slightly decreased our exchange rate expectations for this fiscal year.  For the full year, we\u2019re now assuming an average exchange rate of 1.57 U.S. dollars to the British pound and an average exchange rate of 1.35 U.S. dollars to the euro.  We\u2019ve also narrowed our revenue guidance range and now expect that our fiscal year 2012 revenues will be in the range of $3.41 billion to $3.46 billion.  We\u2019re also increasing our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.05 to $5.15.  We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%.  We expect to have a normalized income tax rate of approximately 37% and diluted shares outstanding of about 72.5 million.  We expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share.", "Now we\u2019ll review our fiscal year guidance for the segments.  We expect revenues in the benefit segment to grow around 4% on a constant currency basis.  We continue to expect that organic growth will be led by health and group benefits.  The NOI margin for benefits is expected to be in the low to mid-30% range.  ", "Next in the risk and financial services segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth will be in the range of 10% to 12% for the fiscal year.  RFS continues to benefit from comparisons to a period in which we did not own EMB for the full quarter, given that the acquisition was closed in late January last year.  We expect the NOI margin to be in the mid-20% range.", "Lastly, in the talent and rewards segment, we\u2019re forecasting constant currency growth of 6% to 8% for the fiscal year.  As we mentioned earlier, the first half of the year is typically seasonally stronger than the second half of the year.  We expect the NOI margin to be about 20%.", "I\u2019m very pleased with our overall performance this quarter.  While we\u2019re keeping a close watch on variables that could impact our performance going forward, the business has good momentum and I continue to be optimistic about our future performance.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Roger.  We\u2019re excited about our opportunities for growth and our continued strong results.  Now we\u2019ll take your questions.", "Question and Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to pose a question, please key star, one.  If your topic has been addressed or you wish to withdraw your question, please key star, two.  Please key star, one for audio questions.", "Your first question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio of Deutsche Bank.  Please proceed.", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks.  John, just wondering about European growth rate versus the U.S. growth rate.  Are you seeing any benefit yet from Solvency II in your risk and software?  Then I have one follow-up, thanks.", "John Haley", "Yeah, I think we\u2019re seeing a little bit of benefit from Solvency II, not a big bump right at the moment but that is something that we\u2019re watching and we think that\u2019s a potential upside there.  I think as we talked there, in some areas we\u2019re seeing a little bit of softness in Europe but we\u2019re still reasonably optimistic about what the remainder of the year will look like.", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And then just a follow-up \u2013 I\u2019m having a hard time getting to the margin guidance you\u2019re giving for the March quarter.  It seems like it\u2019s going to be down year-on-year.  Can you maybe just\u2014is it because of headcount growth, and can you give us an update on where that is?  Thanks.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, maybe just taking the headcount, we do continue to invest in similar kinds of areas that we\u2019ve talked about before in parts of the business that are growing and expect to do that gradually through the remainder of the year, not a dramatic rate that\u2019s really been different than the last few quarters but gradual investment.  ", "The margin guidance \u2013 I think in that range of 19 to 19.5% for the full year, and I think that still puts us around 19.5% for the third quarter, is about where our run rate is; and again, it\u2019s very consistent with what we realized in the second quarter with the fourth quarter being seasonally softer generally.", "Paul Ginocchio \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer of SunTrust.  Please proceed.", "Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust", "Thanks.  I wonder if you could comment about something you touched on in your analyst day, the idea that you may be encouraging incubating ideas for new services and products; and I was wondering if you could give us an update whether there\u2019s some of that in the works currently.  Thanks.", "John Haley", "Yeah, so as we said at analyst day, we want to be better at developing ideas and bringing them to market, and we\u2019ve started addressing that in the organization.  I think it\u2019s in the early stages.  This is not something that was a play where we were thinking that we would be developing things and bringing them out within the next quarter or so, but this is to build organizational competence around developing ideas and bringing them to market.  So we\u2019ve started that.  We\u2019ve formed our new venture in investment counsel and we\u2019ve hired somebody from outside to lead that, and we\u2019re excited about that and building some future prospects there.  But it\u2019s something that we think will pay off in coming years, not immediately.", "Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust", "Thank you.  Could you describe how you see healthcare reform impacting different parts of the business currently?  Thanks.", "John Haley", "Sure.  So I guess the first thing to say is that change is good for us because when there is a lot of change, our clients are looking for people who can understand the impact of change and can quantify it for them.  So we expect that overall healthcare reform is going to drive revenue growth.", "At this point, it\u2019s too early for us to quantify the amount or to know the exact timing.  The provisions that take effect first don\u2019t require as much consulting activity as, say, some of the broader, more strategic items that are effective in later years.  ", "Just thinking overall about healthcare reform initially, it\u2019s our health and group benefits business that\u2019s going to be most impacted.  That team will assist companies with analyzing new regulations, advising on plan design changes.  The retirement business can also be involved as these issues impact retirees and as companies look to redesign their broader rewards programs as a result of the changes.  After companies determine what changes they need to make, there could be opportunities for our communications team to assist with company-wide communications of healthcare plan changes.  ", "We could also have some additional project work around the modification of healthcare plans in our technology administration solutions business, which administers healthcare plans for some of our clients.", "Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair.  Please proceed.", "Tim McHugh \u2013 William Blair", "Yes, hi.  Wanted to ask about investment consulting \u2013 it seems like you had a much more positive tone to the trends there versus the last couple quarters.  Just kind of talk at a high level what\u2019s driving improved performance relative to what you\u2019ve been seeing.", "John Haley", "Yeah, so I think\u2014as we have said in the prior quarters, we thought that demand had taken a bit of a dip but that some of the solutions we were working on, particularly in the implemented consulting, were things that we thought had some traction.  We thought there was a little bit more of a longer sales cycle in some of those coming out of the financial crisis than we thought, but we continued to remain optimistic about the long-term impact or the long-term outlook for investment.  I think what\u2019s happened here just says that\u2014you know, we feel good about what happened.  We feel like this is suggesting that we had that right.", "Now, one of the things about the investment services is they had double-digit growth in all regions this quarter.  That compares to a relatively weak comparable quarter last year, but still it\u2019s overall strong and we feel pretty good that we\u2019ve got the right services for the marketplace.", "Tim McHugh \u2013 William Blair", "Okay, great.  And then Roger, just wanted to ask \u2013 the Fifth Quadrant consolidation, what\u2019s the impact on revenue that we should expect, and should we be assuming a lower contribution going forward from the non-controlling interest line because of that?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, so they come out of equity investments and there\u2019s roughly 16 million or so of revenue in Fifth Quadrant, so it\u2019s pretty small.", "Tim McHugh \u2013 William Blair", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.  Please proceed.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great.  Hey guys.  So really strong results across the board, here.  Maybe just to sort of frame the major benefits section, first of all \u2013 when you guys say you\u2019re seeing increased client demand across the board, can you characterize how much of that is cross-selling into the old sort of Watson Wyatt base and vice versa into the old Towers base, just to get a sense for how much of that traction is coming from potentially increased cross-selling success, or is it more the cycle itself helping you drive some of the success and the increased demand here?", "John Haley", "Yeah, we actually don\u2019t track our revenue at all that way; and in fact even if we tried to, it would be difficult to do that.  Working for these large companies are often some things that both companies did in one respect or another, and it\u2019s a little bit harder to say.  Having said that it\u2019s hard to track that exactly, I would say, though, that the broader and deeper and more comprehensive services that we said were the rationale for doing the merger are clearly having traction in the marketplace, and we are hearing that in spades from our clients.  I travel around to all the different regions to visit with clients of our different segments, and it\u2019s been a constant drumbeat that I\u2019ve heard in the last year or so about how pleased they are with the broad range and the quality and depth of services that we can bring to the marketplace.  So while I can\u2019t quantify it, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a large part of what we\u2019re seeing.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  And maybe just one quick follow-up on the discretionary compensation side \u2013 as a percent of segment operating income, it was a little bit lower this quarter.  Are we still expecting about 38% for the full year?", "John Haley", "Yeah, I\u2019ll let Roger talk about what it will be for the full year.  I would say that there\u2019s artifacts of the way we do it, the way it shows up in the reported numbers.  Internally, the way we allocate our distributable earnings between what goes to shareholders and taxes and what goes to compensation, that hasn\u2019t changed at all.  That\u2019s on a level field.  ", "Roger, do you want to--?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, so the first and second quarter, you can see a pretty big difference in the percentages of discretionary comp.  I think as you\u2019re suggesting, the roughly 38%, or 38 to 39% level on a year-to-date basis is in the ballpark of what we expect for the year.", "Julio Quinteros \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great.  Thanks guys.  Good luck.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Volshteyn of JP Morgan.  Please proceed.", "Jeff Volshteyn \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thank you for taking my question.  Let me follow up on that previous question.  When you talk about the strategic projects that generated revenue growth this quarter, do you feel that these are more discretionary projects work that brings better margin than in the past?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I think when you refer to the strategic projects, I think we referenced that in retirement.  Is that what--?", "Jeff Volshteyn \u2013 JP Morgan", "Correct.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah.  ", "John Haley", "Yeah, so I think the strategic projects are probably what\u2014you know, that adds a little bit, and that\u2019s what makes our revenue growth look a little better than it would have otherwise.  But I don\u2019t know that the margins are different between them.  If you look at the margins for the retirement segment as a whole, they\u2019re not that different from one quarter to the next; and any kind of additional 1% increase would probably bring it up a little bit anyway.  So no, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any fundamental difference there.", "Jeff Volshteyn \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, all right.  And on the foreign exchange, how much of your revenue comes from euro and pound revenue, meaning in your annual guidance, how much of the revenue would be impacted by a change in assumptions for foreign exchange?", "John Haley", "I think it\u2019s about 36% roughly of our revenues are from the whole European Union; but of those revenues, about two-thirds are in pounds sterling and then about one-third are in euros.  So it\u2019s about 24% are in pounds and about 12% of overall Company is in euros; and of course in the euro zone, it tends to be the northern part \u2013 Germany and Netherlands in particular \u2013 where we have the biggest operation.", "Jeff Volshteyn \u2013 JP Morgan", "And remind us \u2013 do you hedge for foreign exchange?", "Roger Millay", "We do a little kind of transactional hedging, but nothing significant.", "Jeff Volshteyn \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, makes sense.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel Nicolaus.  Please proceed.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi.  Thank you very much for taking my questions.  John, I thought you mentioned in the beginning of the call that you had some new client wins on the benefits side, and I was wondering if any of that is in retirement.  I know that retirement doesn\u2019t turn over that often.", "John Haley", "Yeah, we\u2019ve had some wins in the retirement sector; but as you said, that doesn\u2019t turn over that often.  One of the things that we continue to focus on in retirement is to make sure that we have a steady net increase in clients there, and we\u2019ve continued to see that; but that\u2019s not the biggest deal.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.  And then I\u2019m noticing that some of your larger competitors have been losing people.  Are you guys experiencing a tick-up of hires directly from some of your competitors?", "John Haley", "We are hiring folks, and we\u2019re continuing to see some good folks that are on the market and that have been interested in joining us.  So yeah, we\u2019re doing that and we\u2019re probably doing a little more of that than maybe we were a year or two ago.  I think part of that is a natural consequence of we weren\u2019t doing as much right after the merger when we were more focused with just bringing the two organizations together; but we really feel like we\u2019ve got everything working the way we had hoped it would now, and of course we have a pretty attractive proposition for our clients and when we have an attractive proposition for our clients, I think that also makes consultants want to join an organization like that.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, thanks for the color.  And then Roger, the AR DSO was higher than expected.  We usually get a seasonal tick-down that\u2019s pretty nice in the second quarter, and we just didn\u2019t see that.  Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on there?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, DSO actually, as we track it, is pretty flat; so we had a big spike in revenue this quarter and consistent with the revenue being relatively flat, AR is up about the amount that revenues were up versus the September quarter.  So we think it spiked but it\u2019s for a good reason \u2013 we\u2019re investing in working capital because we\u2019re growing the business.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I understand that it\u2019s flat, but if I look back to, say, the last three or four years, I saw between a four and seven-day sequential decline.  Is there anything different about including the Towers prior results in the numbers that would lead the seasonality to be different?", "Roger Millay", "I don\u2019t think so; and again, not the way\u2014you know, we\u2019re not tracking it really the way you are, so I\u2019d have to go back and take a look at those prior years.  But again, as we manage receivables relative to the momentum of the business, it all seems in appropriate shape to us.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum-  Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, I\u2019m going to sneak in one last housekeeping question.  In the reconciliation of operating income to the segment income, you have $22 million of expenses under other.  Can you just talk a little bit about what that is?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, there\u2019s really two main drivers there, and as you probably point out, it\u2019s a little bit different that we normally have on that line.  One is that\u2014so the items that pop up there are items that we would adjust for at the corporate level outside of the segment NOI results, and one item here\u2014or one of the items that\u2019s in there that had an impact this quarter is our long-term stock compensation incentive program, the accounting for that which will bounce around depending on company results and depending on whether there are any changes with participants in that program.  So we had \u2013 and I think I mentioned it in my script, I think \u2013 but we had several million dollars of additional expense this quarter, again just as a result of the timing of recognition of stock compensation expense.", "The other item that\u2019s again an item of true-up at the corporate level is reserves for revenue and receivables, and the way we book that is again there\u2019s a policy at the segment level, but there\u2019s an overall umbrella policy for GAAP compliance.  This quarter, we added reserves at the corporate level, again not indicative of any issues relative to underlying receivables, just really the way that the relationship of the two formulae came out.  So those are the two things, really, main things that are driving that $22 million.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, thanks a lot.  Good quarter, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.  Please proceed.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Good morning, guys, and congratulations on the solid quarter.  I guess my first question is asking about the sequential guide for 3Q.  Even though it is normally your strongest seasonal quarter, the guide\u2014even after I adjust for the tax rate in 2Q, seems to be more flattish as opposed to up.  I\u2019m kind of wondering how much of that is\u2014if you could quantify continued investments versus potentially some talks to the uncertainty of timing on more elevated costs.", "Roger Millay", "Well, I think there should be growth in there, Ashwin.  I guess I\u2019ll say that as we looked at the guidance, the underlying assumptions show organic revenue growth consistent with what we\u2019ve shown in the first half, adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of where we\u2019ve been operating; so we think it shows continued good execution, again consistent with where we\u2019ve been.  And there is an impact of currency, of course, in there as well that knocks off a few cents.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Right, right.  No, I mean, it\u2019s just I already adjusted my model for currency, so I was just curious.", "John Haley", "No, I think\u2014Ashwin, we had a very strong quarter last year, too, and so we weren\u2019t necessarily projecting that we would grow off that.  But when we look at the margin for the whole year, saying that we\u2019re coming out in the 19 to 19.5% on adjusted EBITDA, we feel that\u2019s a pretty strong result.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, okay.  Yeah.  No, that would be.  I mean, it would kind of put you about where you talked for, for margins.  The use of cash \u2013 you finished your buyback.  I guess you might at some point decide to do more of one, potentially a dividend increase again this year.  How does the M&A pipeline look?  If you could talk about those factors.", "John Haley", "So I think\u2014look, we\u2019re always on the lookout for whether there are some good acquisitions that we can bring into the organization, and we want to be in a position where if we find them, we can act on them.  We feel like we\u2019re well-placed for that right now, so we continue to investigate opportunities.  As we\u2019ve said before, of course, we\u2019re relatively cautious.  We want to make sure we only do good acquisitions, and so we have a reasonably high bar for that; but we continue to be active looking there.  ", "We\u2019re not sure what we\u2019re going to be doing, what other plans we might have for capital, but certainly we could do another buyback of the kind we\u2019ve done so far and we don\u2019t think that would have much impact on our ability to execute on some M&A transactions.  Whether we\u2019re going to do that or not is something I think the Board will be thinking about during the coming months.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay.  And clearly if you don\u2019t know yet, then it\u2019s not in your guidance, just to be clear, right?", "Roger Millay", "Right.  Nothing is in our guidance.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay.  One last question \u2013 as we see sort of a continued low interest rate environment and continued stock market volatility, are you seeing maybe a higher number of plan sponsors come to you about their pension plans and wanting to discuss the outcome\u2014eventual outcome of those?", "John Haley", "Well, I think the whole issue of plan funding, of de-risking of pension plans, of planning for different environments is something that there\u2019s a lot of work going on in that right now, and so plan sponsors are interested.  I think it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s probably helped retirement revenues.  There\u2019s a lot of wanting to think about different what-ifs and scenarios.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, great.  This is a good quarter, guys.  Thank you.", "John Haley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird.  Please proceed.", "Mark Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Good morning, and let me add my congratulations.  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your consultants across the different practice areas.  Just wondering a couple of elements \u2013 one, what are you seeing just in terms of retention rates, compensation expectations among those existing consultants?  Are things getting any more expensive now that the environment seems to be improving?  And then secondly, where were the areas where the headcount grew the strongest during this past quarter, and what should we expect over the course of this coming year along the headcount front?", "John Haley", "Well I\u2019ll let Roger talk about the headcount in a second.  Let me just address \u2013 I mean, I think we\u2019ve sort of alluded to it a few times in the script as we were going through it, but we just couldn\u2019t be prouder of the work that our associates are doing.  They\u2019re delivering phenomenal results.  Our clients are continually expressing appreciation for the work they\u2019re doing, and I think the high-quality work they\u2019re doing shows up in the results that we have.", "There\u2019s a lot of reasons why I think you want to be running a profitable company.  It\u2019s one that enables you to reward your shareholders; it\u2019s one that enables you to invest in tools and processes.  But perhaps the most important is it enables you to reward your associates appropriately, and so one of the things we feel good about with the results we have is that we\u2019re able to deliver good compensation to our associates.  So I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s broadly appreciated, and we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we\u2019re a reasonably attractive organization for new folks to join and I think that\u2019s been reflected I that.  So our retention rates are right about where we\u2019d like them to be, and we feel pretty good about that.", "Roger, maybe you want to address the headcount?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I think similar to where we\u2019ve been, headcount adds have been sprinkled around.  This past quarter, it was more in the risk and financial services and talent and rewards segment, but overall not dramatically large numbers \u2013 kind of the 1 to 2% range.", "Mark Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "And where would you expect the year to end up?", "Roger Millay", "We don\u2019t have a forecast on that at our fingertips here; but again, I think that single digit growth rate is what we would anticipate \u2013 lower single digits.", "Mark Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay.  And then with regards to the technology installation, you mentioned that the cost is going to be towards the upper end.  Is there other things that you\u2019re doing or additional modules that you\u2019re putting in place that you weren\u2019t previously planning on, or what\u2019s driving that?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, and again that\u2019s for overall transaction and integration expenses, so as we mentioned this quarter\u2014so one of the factors in there, we did have this settlement with a former affiliate of one of the companies, so that\u2019s not something that was included in the guidance that we gave in September.  That\u2019s a factor.  We\u2019ve also\u2014you know, as you go through these programs, we initially had some assumptions about how much might be CAPEX, how much might be operating expenses, and there\u2019s been a little bit of a shift in that.  So again, it\u2019s not dramatic \u2013 we still expect to be in the range, but at the higher end of the range as opposed to targeting the middle of the range.  There\u2019s really not additional modules or projects or anything anticipated in that.", "Mark Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Great.  And then from a strategic perspective, John, you\u2019ve done a great job in terms of growing the company over the years and making some great moves.  Are you seeing things that look attractive?  Is there anything that we should think about or\u2014I mean, you haven\u2019t let any moss grow under the stone here.  Even with the integration, you\u2019re still making moves.  Should we anticipate that to continue?", "John Haley", "I think as a management team, we want to be always looking for opportunities and we want to make sure that we\u2019re doing the right thing for the long-run future of the business so we\u2019re continuing to do that.  We don\u2019t have anything on the drawing board right now that we\u2019re looking at, but I think we\u2019re always looking for opportunities and we\u2019re always thinking about what\u2019s the right thing for long-term success.", "Mark Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, so it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s anything huge that just jumps out at you right now.", "John Haley", "That\u2019s correct.", "Mark Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, great.  And then finally, you\u2019ve done a great job in terms of the margins.  As we think longer term, is there still room for margin improvement or should we think that maybe more of the investments are going to go towards growing the top line in the future, and maybe the margins are in relatively good shape at this point?", "John Haley", "Well, we\u2019ve been saying for a couple quarters now that if we had our druthers we would probably look to grow the top line a little more, even if that meant that we kept the margins flat as to where they were; and I think that would still be our preference.  We\u2019re going to be looking to get growth as opposed to margin expansion.  Now, we don\u2019t want to get unprofitable growth, for sure, so we\u2019re looking to get things that are going to really add to the bottom line over the years.  But I think that\u2019s the trade-off we\u2019re trying to evaluate right now.", "Mark Marcon \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Appreciate the color.  Thank you.", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of Tobey Sommer of SunTrust.  Please proceed.", "Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust", "Thank you, my question has been answered.", "Operator", "Again ladies and gentlemen, that is star, one for audio questions.", "John Haley", "Okay, well if there are no more questions, let me just say thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to reviewing our third quarter results with you in May.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

For a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the mostly closely comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release and the accompanying financial tables we posted this morning.", "After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks Aida. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we\u2019ll review our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and discuss some of the high level expectations for the full fiscal year, for the full-year of fiscal 2013.", "Overall, we had a strong fiscal year 2012 with 5% revenue growth and strong profit growth. However, we experienced some challenges this quarter. Despite these challenges, when we step back and look at where we're headed for fiscal year 2013, we see many signs indicating continued growth and strengthening of our business.", "Reported revenues for the quarter were $826 million, a decrease of 3% over prior year reported revenues and flat on an organic basis. Our organic growth rate, adjust for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures.", "Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $161 million or 19.5% of revenues, up from $159 million or 18.7% of revenues last year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.91 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.25. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 18% over the prior year; this increase was due in large part to the benefit we received from the fourth quarter tax rate.", "There were a few factors that impacted revenue performance this quarter. Risk and Financial services was very strong overall; we experienced accounting and business impacts from our ERP transition in North America and had weaker results from our Talent and Rewards segment.", "As we have discussed overtime, we adjust our discretionary compensation pool based on earnings performance. Giver our revenue and profit shortfall this quarter, funding levels have been adjusted accordingly and Roger will discuss this in more detail a little later in the call.", "We continue to be confident in our growth strategies and see great prospects for the future of Towers Watson; although there are challenges in Europe and the slowdown in our clients discretionary spend has impacted our Talent and Rewards business we are pleased with the EMEA results. The economic news from China has been concerning us well, but today, we continue to see positive results from the Asia-Pacific region.", "Despite the bump in our U.S. operations this quarter, there are several positive trends we expect to build on in the near future. Healthcare Reform and pension derisking are creating opportunities for our consultants and of course being a market leader of the emerging retiree exchange business puts Towers Watson in a unique position.", "I must say I am even more excited about Exchange Solutions today than when the acquisition of Extend Health was announced. I am continuing on the foundation we build and we continue to strengthen for solid long-term growth and profitability.", "Now let\u2019s look at the performance of each of our segments. On an organic basis, Risk and Financial services grew six percent, Benefits grew 1% and Talent and Rewards was flat. We saw good growth momentum in many of our lines of business. As a result of the ERP system deployment in the US, we experienced significant billing delays which increased revenue reserves at the segment level as compared to last year.", "While we may progress this quarter, there is still work to do get our billing processes back to normal. By phasing the deployment in the new system, the business impacts felt were identified and mitigated in the early stages of EMEA rollout. So while we expect to experience some business impact as we deploy globally, we don\u2019t anticipate the impact being as great as what we have seen in the US. The Benefits and Talent and Rewards segment were hardest hit by these transition issues.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $473 million. Benefits segment revenues were up 1% on a constant currency basis. The Americas region revenues were flat, EMEA revenues increased by 3%. Retirement revenues decreased by 1% on a constant currency basis driven by a 2% decrease in Americas revenues. The pipeline of work continues to look good particularly in the areas of derisking lump sum projects.", "However, the ERP related issues noted earlier affected the quarter\u2019s results. The EMEA retirement revenues were flat this quarter. Projects were delayed pending the drafting of regulations issued in June. Technology and Administration solution revenues increased by mid-single digits on a constant currency basis; EMEA had a very strong quarter with high single digit growth. We continue to add new clients and the pipeline looks strong. We had mid single digit constant currency revenue growth in health and group benefits where growth was driven by product sales. There's been intense client engagement since the Supreme Court decision to uphold healthcare reform. ", "We held a series of client webcast which highlighted the implication of the mandate on the corporations and more than 1700 participants attended. Going forward the benefit segment should show modest growth with sustained momentum in TAS and HGB supplemented by project activity and retirement. ", "Now let me turn to risk and financial services. For the quarter, the risk and financial services segment had a strong quarter with revenues of $199 million. Revenues were up 6% on a constant currency basis on good performance across the lines of business. Risk consulting and software revenue increased by 5% on a constant currency basis with strong growth in North America consulting and in software globally. We remain cautious about Europe as discretionary spending seems to be tightening. ", "We were pleased to see the continued growth trend in brokerage, a strong renewal in new business season with favorable pricing conditions drove the growth to mid single digits this quarter. Investment had double digit constant currency growth. The Americas region had mid single digit growth while both Asia Pacific and EMEA experienced double digit growth. We had a strong focus on marketing in EMEA and are seeing these efforts pay off. In general, the pipeline of investment work looks good globally. We expect risk and financial services to maintain its positive momentum. ", "Now let's move on to Talent and Rewards. For the quarter the Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $130 million with revenues flat on an organic basis. Rewards, Talent, and Communication grew by 4%. The Americas region revenue increased by 6% and the pipeline continues to look good.", "EMEA revenues decreased by 10% as discretionary spending continue to tighten across continental Europe, and we\u2019ve seen spending drop in the UK as well. Data service and technology revenues decreased by 12% on a constant currency basis with declines in all regions. The decline was driven by our data services business, which experienced impacts from the rationalization of our legacy product platforms over the past year and [amortization] of the accounting processes.", "This change shifted revenues into the first and second quarters of the fiscal year. We did see a drop in European sales in the fourth quarter and are cautious about potential slowdown in mid-market subscription sales during fiscal 2013.", "We expect to see growth in data services in the first half of fiscal year 2013. The Executive compensation consulting environment continues to be strong in the US and the Asia Pacific. While we had seen some softening in Europe the previous quarters, EMEA\u2019s revenues grew by 4% this quarter. We continued to be watchful of the environment in Europe but we feel we\u2019re well positioned there.", "Overall, we continue to see good opportunities in Talent and Rewards but are monitoring the survey business and the pipeline for rewards; talent and communication work in EMEA carefully. We expect to see mixed results in Talent and Rewards given the pressure in Europe, offset by continued growth in activity in Americas and Asia Pacific.", "The acquisition of Extend Health was formalized at the end of May. For the quarter, Exchange Solutions reported $4 million of revenues net of deferral revenues for the purchase accounting rules. We had a very successful sales season and will be enrolling a record number of members during the [form] enrollment period which will be an excess of the previously forecasted 30%. We will provide more details on the exchange solutions business during our Analyst Day event next month.", "To a great extent, we are where we should be as we begin our third full fiscal year and prepare formally [exit] integration activities. We have leveraged the broad base of Towers Watson to expand in growing markets such as corporate healthcare. We have enhanced our leadership in retirement to assist clients with their financial risks around the fine benefit pensions. We globalized our client management process and we have extended our leadership position in risk consulting. We have good opportunities and strong teams in our businesses.", "We had a very good fiscal year and the performance in the fourth quarter is not indicative of the strength of our business model or the activity we see in the pipeline. I have every confidence in our long-term growth strategies and our leadership team. We have positioned fiscal 2013 cautiously as the global economic environment is becoming more uncertain. ", "We see this fiscal year as a year of a simulation, cost management and targeted prudent investments. Before I turn the call over to Roger, I would like to thank all of the Towers Watson associates for a terrific fiscal year. We have had to manage through some very complex market issues this year while also deploying globally ERP system, yet you are focused on serving our clients and continuing to develop leading edge market solutions is not wavered. ", "Now I will turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks John and good morning to everyone. As John mentioned, we had good success in fiscal year 2012. We drove through some major initiatives that are strengthening the company and we generally met or exceeded our key financial goals. ", "However, the fourth quarter was tough and fell short of our expectations driven by a few driven by a few notable factors. ", "Organic revenue overall was flat for the quarter below what we expected. We were surprised by the shortfall although, perhaps it is in totally shocking given the clearly more challenging macro environment and that we deployed new billing process and systems for the majority of the company in the middle of year. ", "As John mentioned, the shortfall was driven by the impacts of our ERP conversion and the talent and reward segment. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 19.5% about as expected but only because we had a lower bonus accrual in response to our disappointing financial performance. ", "There were couple of items driving overall financial performance, I want to cover in more detail. First the ERP conversion impact, we continue to recover from the billing process delays created in the early months of the North America deployment. We had a vigorous billing and collections push in North America in the June quarter in response to elevated receivable level at the March quarter end. ", "Overall, North America's receivables were reduced this quarter with good progress made on unbilled receivables. We will continue to press on this billing and collections backlog until our DSO is back to normal. The impact on revenues comes from reserves and adjustments provided through the billing and collection process. ", "At this point, we [haven't] experienced similar issues in our EMEA deployment. However, we continue to expect unbilled and billed receivable balances to remain elevated as we complete the ERP roll out over the next few quarters. The significant area is bonus accrual. Overall, our discretionary compensation expense was $29 million lower than last year's fourth quarter. The lower accrual level reflects our shortfall against revenue and income goals. We cultivated a strong pay for performance culture and we review discretionary funding levels carefully each quarter. ", "Due to the overall strong fiscal year, we are pleased to say that bonuses will still fund at planned targeted levels given the performance earlier in the year. Our fourth quarter revenue shortfall translated into a slight decrease in the benefits and talent reward segment margins. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger accounting and transaction and integration costs.", "For the quarter, the benefit segment had a 31% NOI margin, Risk and Financial Services had a 22% NOI margin and Talent and Rewards had a 12% NOI margin. Net income attributable to controlling interests for the quarter was $65 million; adjusted net income was $90 million.", "This quarter we had $21 million of transaction and integration costs versus $21 million last quarter and $23 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. About $5 million of these expenses relates to transaction costs for the Extend Health acquisition. The majority of the remaining costs in this line continue to be related to our large IT initiatives, integrating both the ERP software and hardware platforms of the company.", "A hardware platform project is scheduled to be complete in the September quarter, the new Oracle ERP system is deployed throughout the Americas and most of EMEA covering almost 90% of our revenues. We are moving forward with finalizing EMEA in November and starting the deployment in Asia Pacific as planned.", "The normalized tax rate for the quarter was 34%; the forecasted rate was 37%. This will be the last quarter a normalized rate will be reported.", "Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.91, up 52% from $0.59 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.25.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. As of June 30, we had $408 million in cash available for our use. Free cash flow was forecasted to come in slightly below our original guidance of $275 million to $300 million. It actually came in much lower than anticipated at $192 million. Two main factors contribute to the short fall. A continued drain from the ERP billing issues and higher levels of fixed asset purchases, the majority of the fixed assets purchases related to the ERP system implementation and the hardware platform project.", "We had $208 million of borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter, which is mainly related to the acquisition of Extend Health. We also secured a five-year term loan in the amount of $250 million to fund the purchase. The term loan amortizes at a rate of $6.25 million per quarter beginning in September 2013, with the final maturity of June 2017.", "Last quarter, the board authorized a $150 million stock repurchase program. Given the borrowing for the Extend acquisition, we are not utilizing that authority at this time. Under our anti-dilution repurchase authorization, we purchased a 136,000 shares during the quarter and 192,000 shares in July to offset the dilution related to Extend Health options.", "Now let\u2019s review our outlook for fiscal year 2013. Today, we will provide you with fiscal year 2013 first quarter guidance as well as some context for our full-year fiscal 2013 outlook. As a reminder, we will provide full fiscal year guidance at our Analyst Day on September 14.", "For the first quarter, we expect revenues will be in the range of $805 million to $825 million. On a constant currency basis this correlates to a growth rate of 2% to 4%. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of a $1.5 to a $1.10. Our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be around 17.5%. There is a point worth noting regarding this guidance. Exchange Solutions has strong seasonal swings in its business model. ", "During the first half of the fiscal year staffing has ramped up to accommodate enrollment deadlines. However, revenues only begin to be recognized when the policies become effective. The majority of our policies are effective January 1. As a result, profitability is low in the first half of the fiscal year depressing our profit margins. The acquisition of Extend Health changes the year-over-year comparisons for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS.", "For the first quarter, we are assuming an average exchange rate of $1.55 to the British pound and an average exchange rate of $1.25 to the euro. We expect an income tax rate of around 37% and diluted shares outstanding of about 72 million.", "Now we will review our fiscal year first quarter guidance for the segments. We expect revenue growth in the Benefit segment to be 0% to 2% on a constant currency basis. The NOI margin for benefits is expected to be about 30%.", "Next in the Risk and Financial Services segment we expect constant currency revenue growth will be in the 1% to 3% range for the quarter. We expect the NOI margin to be the low to mid 20% range.", "Moving to the Talent and Rewards segment we are forecasting constant currency growth in the range of 1% to 4%. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low to mid 20% range. Finally we expect Exchange Solutions revenue of approximately $12 million which is net of deferred revenues we are not able to recognize due to acquisition accounting.", "On a pro forma basis we are expecting Exchange Solutions to grow about 20%. As discussed previously due to the seasonality of the Extend Health business model, the anticipated strength of this year's enrollment increase and the impact of the deferred revenue write-offs, we anticipate NOI loss of approximately $7 million in the first quarter.", "For fiscal year 2013 overall, we are targeting mid single digit constant currency revenue growth with an adjusted EBITDA margin around 19% to 19.5%. Our comparables will be more challenging especially in the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to be cautious about Europe, the news of an economic slowdown in China and how both of these economies impact the US.", "We will also continue to work through our billing issues in North America and to finalize the global ERP deployment. Despite our caution and operational concerns, we are seeing some positive trends as well. The work around de-risking in lumpsum payouts appears to be gaining traction and we certainly feel good about our healthcare consulting and exchange opportunities. We have also discussed some of the positive momentum, we are seeing in certain lines of business in Europe and Asia Pacific.", "I am pleased with our overall performance this fiscal year. As a result of the tremendous efforts made by our associates in all parts of the company, we saw much success during the year which makes the fourth quarter results even more disappointing. We are keeping a close watch on variables that could impact our performance, understand the factors that impacted our fourth quarter results and we feel we are taking appropriate measures to mitigate these issues. However, the business has good underlying momentum and I continue to be optimistic about our future performance.", "Now I will turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks Roger and now we will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first quarter comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Roger, can you quantify how significant ERP issues were on revenue, because the revenue lines were below expectations, just about everywhere and certainly versus the high end of the range. And I was wondering if you had like a dollar value, was it $20 million, $30 million, $40 million something that you can put to that?", "Roger Millay", "", "It\u2019s tough to be totally precise about those impacts, but what we can see is the impacts quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year on the reserves and adjustments line and that was around $20 million. Of course, the other factors are, there is distraction that goes on as a result of the efforts, the billing focus, but you can't really quantify that, so I would say at least $20 million.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "And is this something that should be reversing once you work through some of the issues?", "Roger Millay", "Well, you would hope that, I mean that's the opportunity with the delay we have quite strict reserving requirements and that are based on aging. So you know there is a great opportunity for us to recover some of that as we collect the aged receivable, so that would be the hope, but no guarantees as we work through that.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "And with Risk and Financial services, you actually did have a pretty decent revenue, but net operating income was decently lower than what we were thinking about; was there anything else going in that unit that we should be paying attention to?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I think one of the things is you know, the brokerage business bounces around quarter-to-quarter. So this was seasonally a softer period in brokerage which brought the overall margin down. So I think just seasonally we would expect a little bit lower margin in our RFS this quarter; that\u2019s the biggest thing I have noted.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, and if we could just squeeze in a couple of little things. Data and Surveys, is that very discretionary; that\u2019s been the highlight for you guys for the last probably over a year and it\u2019s been strong seems to be coming down all of a sudden. Is there a particularly discretionary or something else going on?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I think you know, there is a bit of discretionary spend in there, so I think we noted in the script that we did see a little bit of a decline in Europe and this is the compensation surveys specifically that we\u2019re talking about now, but the biggest impact in data surveys and technologies is this time being an accounting impacts overall related to the consolidation of the two legacy company survey platforms so that was going on over the last year.", "We moved to one platform and of course one accounting methodology and it does relate back if you recall we had a similar situation in the September quarter. This was kind of a parallel to that and things should even out next year because then we will be comparing on the same business to the same business on the same type of accounting methodology. But there is, we did note in Europe also that beyond those impacts we think there was just a decline in business that was probably somewhat cyclically oriented.", "", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Then how much interest expense should we expect going forward for third quarter?", "", "Roger Millay", "I think that\u2019s something we will give you; I mean it shouldn\u2019t change all that much, I don\u2019t think in the September quarter and that\u2019s something when we give full guidance, we will give you.", "", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "", "Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "For the guidance for the first quarter, could you talk about what\u2019s driving margins down in Benefits and Risk and Financial services but growing in Talent and Rewards?", "", "Roger Millay", "Dealing with the last piece, Talent and Rewards is just cyclical, that\u2019s the normal cyclical pattern that they are stronger in the September and December quarters. In terms of the other two, I think it\u2019s -- are you looking at down versus the\u2026", "", "Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Year-over-year?", "", "Roger Millay", "I think it\u2019s for the most part it\u2019s just us settling into the EBITDA margin levels that we\u2019ve talked about really since the beginning of the deal. And so with low levels of organic revenue growth these are the levels of NOI margins that equate to that kind of 19% to 19.5% EBITDA margins. Apart of what\u2019s going on in the P&L now for the last year is as we\u2019ve added resources over the past year, you are now seeing the effect of that, so I think that\u2019s a part of it is well.", "John Haley", "I mean I just finally Sara, I think if we think about lets say Benefits, if we think about it performing at a level that we think is a very high level, we think that\u2019s an NOI of about 30% of or so and so that\u2019s what we gave in the guidance. Now, last year we had historically high rate for the first quarter, we just decided not to continue to project it at that historic high rate, but we think 30% NOI is a very good performance level for Benefits.", "Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then separately, I don\u2019t think you had planned to hire across the segments in the fourth quarter; did you follow that plan?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I think, the hiring was quite similar to the third quarter. We hired people I think in all the segments; that was a few hundred people again pretty similar to the third quarter and again some of the hires again similar to the March quarter; some of those hire is related to the build up in Asia of some of the kind of centralized administrative services that we are building there. I think that was fairly similar.", "John Haley", "And one of the things that happened in our fourth fiscal quarter is that we are hiring new university graduates every year, so we are always hiring some of them.", "Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And just last one, health and group benefits revenue was up in the mid-single digits; was that generally in line with what you were expecting; do you think we should see a ramp from here?", "John Haley", "We were expecting something in the mid-to-high single digits for the healthy group benefits. I think we've, I think during the call we referenced the response we've had to the Supreme Court decision and I think that the level of interest in what's going on there has been even higher than we had anticipated whether that develops into additional work and additional growth in revenues I think we will see but we are encouraged.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "", "Maybe just real quickly to start on the assumptions for Europe as you guys think about the build out for at least the first quarter of fiscal 2013, maybe by segment, can you just walk us through real quickly how you are thinking about some of the demand trends for benefits for Risk and Talent and Rewards in Europe specifically?", "Roger Millay", "", "I'll hit some of the highlights and John might have some thoughts too. I think Europe\u2019s actually interesting for us at the moment because we do have some within some of the lines of business some very positive things going on. So there are kind of pushes and pulls, I mean I think we referred to it in the remarks that if you look at Talent and Rewards that is our most cyclical business and we are continuing to watch for pressure there. ", "And particularly in the line of business that we call rewards and Talent and Communication which is the most projects oriented. In terms of the benefit segment particularly in the administration business they have had some very good trends, they have had some very good clear wins over the last year and we see that benefiting revenues heading into 2013 and you see growth there. In terms of retirement in EMEA and they've been kind of flattish to modestly down I think the last couple quarters and I think probably being in that kind of area you know, is roughly what we would expect.", "In our RFS, the businesses are doing quite well there. You know, I think similar to this quarter, maybe not the some high level but investment is growing. The brokerage business is continuing to do reasonably well and the risk consulting area is doing quite well as well. So you know, kind of neck-to-neck at the moment. We do have some good trends going on that offset cyclical weakness that we see in Talent and Rewards.", "John Haley", "You know, I guess the only thing I would add is that there are a couple of areas in benefiting Europe where we see some potential for some growth and it's fundamentally due to delayed legislation. There is a whole area around auto enrollment and DC budgeted revenues that we had, we have faced them in the expectation that activity related to an auto enrollment would have started earlier in this calendar year, but the final regulations weren\u2019t published by the UK government until the beginning of February and so that\u2019s delayed our consulting activity. ", "We spent a fair amount of time building our service offerings and our sales plans around auto enrollment in the UK. This work has being chargeable, you know, non-chargeable at this stage but it is work that would support our consulting activities over the coming months. So we see the auto enrollment work commencing in the first quarter of fiscal \u201913.", "The other area is around enhanced transferred values and these so called pies the pension increase exchanges. There had been some concerns expressed by the UK pensions\u2019 minister over the use of these liability management exercises by companies, a new code of conduct came out in June of 2012 and a number of high value projects that had been hold we think should commence.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "May be just two quick ones on the free cash flow guidance for the first quarter given all the movements around the European billing situation what is your expectation for first quarter free cash flow?", "Roger Millay", "We are not guiding on free cash flow at this point and again we will talk about that more in the Analyst Day. Of course, the September quarter for us is the quarter in which we generally have negative free cash because of the bonus payment. So I think the way we are managing the business one you have the bonus payment if you take that out we all know that we need to push on the North America receivable situation and it\u2019s stabilized I think in the June quarter and now we got to push it down and that should be actually a source of cash as we move forward here in the next couple of quarters, but we have got some work to do that. Otherwise, I think it\u2019s kind of business as usual, but so the net of that is hopefully some positive trends, we got to pay the bonuses some negative free cash but we will give you more specifics on the Analyst Day.", "", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, so minimum the DSOs will be kind of the biggest push in terms of any improvement from here or getting DSOs to actually move down from here.", "", "Roger Millay", "Yeah I think that\u2019s right.", "", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "And then just trying to go back on the margin point that you made earlier just want to make sure I understood I thought I heard you say something anywhere on the 17 and some change but can you just go back to the margin point about the first quarter and then you expectations for fiscal 2013 please?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah important point, so let me do with and without exchange solutions margin discussion. So without exchange added in, we expect for the year to be managing through margins that are consistent with a levels that we have been talking about for the company and let's call it that 19% to 19.5% range and this is adjusted EBITDA margins we are talking about now. ", "Exchange solutions has very distinct financial seasonality. I mean it is business seasonality but really it impacts the financials. So in the first half of the year because in particularly in growth mode because they add a number of people and a good portion of those are temporary resources in order to facilitate the enrollment of new members into the exchange.", "And we said in the first quarter we don\u2019t expect to loose about $7 million in the NOI line, they have an increase in expenses and the revenues don\u2019t come in until people are enrolled and the related policies begin and that\u2019s when we start getting the commission revenue.", "So again imagine September and December quarters they have a lot of people, no commission revenue starting in January most of the policy come on in January 1st that is when the revenue comes on and we take the commission revenue over the policy period and the temporary labor goes away. ", "So what that means is you have a real dampening for the company of adjusted EBITDA margins in the first half of the fiscal year. So that's why we are staying around 17.5% for the September quarter, but yet the Extend acquisition which is now Exchange Solutions is fully on track in terms of growth and the prospects we see forward. I know that was long winded, but hopefully that helped you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "I have a few questions. I guess, talking about the billing issues, could you provide some details as to what exactly you mean by billing issues. These are projects and work that you've done and the bills did not go out for some reason because of the implementation of the new system, our people not adequately trained to use the system, what's going on.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, so what happened was we launched the US I guess it was December 1 I think, right and we launched Canada last August. The Canada launch of course that's a smaller part of the company. We noted in the first couple of months of billing some challenges in working with the new system.", "We noted some which isn't unusual in these things, some particular changes that were needed in the Oracle software to fully accommodate all the operational impacts that people have as they take their time month to month, assess how much of that time will be billed and then issue the bill.", "When we launched the US, of course the volume of bills and time sheets in the US is multiples of what it was in Canada, that just the working through that process was more time consuming and more cumbersome and we had a backlog and we weren\u2019t able to work through and our people weren\u2019t able to work through it.", "And as timely fashion as usual and so we ended up with a backlog, again of just during the month issuance of bills. So it's all projects, it's a work that\u2019s being done. And it's with those delays of timing, you know, just billing assessments that backed up and we\u2019re working through that now.", "So, it really is more and kind of execution of the billing process backlog and then we had changes that we\u2019re making in to the system to facilitate the process going forward and that\u2019s been going on at the same time. So, we've got to work through the backlog and you know, again we turned the corner on that but it's just a high volume that we got behind on.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "So revenue was hurt in Q1 and Q1 will continue to be hurt because it's what you\u2019ve done, but you\u2019re not able to bill because there are continued delays in putting the T&E data in to your system?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I mean that\u2019s close actually. The only little bit of a tweak I would make to that is that if you notice on the balance sheet, the change from the March quarter to the June quarter and the receivables line is that the unbilled line came down.", "So it was up quite a bit in the March quarter. And so that was more working through the lag in taking time and turning it into a bill. So in the June quarter, we had pretty decent success in that. We got a lot of bills out but of course they weren\u2019t all collected. So now the bubble so to speak transferred more to the billed receivables line. So now it\u2019s turning more relatively into collect the bills rather than get the bills out the door. And again both in what we can whip which is the unbilled as well as the billed, we have these reserving levels that start at 90 days kick in and we reversed the revenue.", "And so if we work through this process expeditiously now, that\u2019s the opportunity actually is to issue those bills, collect the money and some of those reserves will come back and that\u2019s what we would be hoping to see over here over the next few months.", "John Haley", "Yeah, so I think the only thing I would add Ashwin is that I think you said we would continue to be hurt in the first quarter and as Roger just pointed out not only won\u2019t we necessarily continue to be hurt in the first quarter, but indeed there is an opportunity for us to recapture some of this thing.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "But is that opportunity to recapture in your guidance because you have turned the corner, but the fact is that your DSOs went from 37 to 35. Last year they were 30 and 30.", "John Haley", "No the opportunity is not in our guidance.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "Okay. And I wanted to clarify that. The second thing is on the NOI loss, I missed the details behind the NOI. Is that loss included in your guidance?", "Roger Millay", "For Exchange Solutions.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "Yes.", "Roger Millay", "Yes, it is included in the guidance.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "That is included in the guidance, okay. Am I right in may be assessing the Q1 impact from the billing issues at also, say call it to $20 million to $30 million in terms of the opportunity?", "Roger Millay", "Well that is almost by definition I suppose if we got the reserves back to the normal levels -- you are asking how much is the opportunity?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "Yeah ", "Roger Millay", "So almost by definition, you know that would be it. I mean you can \u2013 look, these things when you are processing kind of millions of things through a system, getting all the way back to normal and assuming full recovery you know we'd hope for that result. But I am not sure that -- we are obviously not giving guidance to that level. So we just got to work it through, that is the theoretical opportunity but you know we are more focused on getting the work done right now.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "Absolutely and you feel confident with the system as it is, the changes and tweaks you have made that when you roll it out to Europe and you roll it out to Latin America it should not cause similar issues?", "Roger Millay", "It is interesting and so again the work changes that we were making in the fall and early winter that really just got finalized in the last few months that really accommodated all the nuances of the business let me say. So it is interesting that as we rolled out to the UK, which of course was rolled out March 1st, you know we are not seeing any issues and we had a second wave on May 1st in EMEA. And so we are definitely seeing that as the company gets more experienced in working with the new systems in process; it\u2019s going more smoothly and we are quite confident, we\u2019re very confident with the changes that we put in. So we know that every month we are getting very close to a stabilized level. So that's why our emphasis is more on cleaning up kind of the backlog from six to nine months ago.", "John Haley", "Yeah, I mean these are pains related to the initial implementation, not really, we feel pretty confident about that this is a good platform going forward Ashwin, so the only, let me just also mention something just your question for about exchange triggered it, but the seasonality that we are seeing in exchange and as Roger said that is in our guidance, that's exactly what we knew about from the beginning before we acquired it and I think we had talked about that seasonality at the time of the acquisition, so there is no surprises here. This was what we knew all along and how we knew it would play out.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "And last thing not so much of a question, as a suggestion, the last two years, three years now, this is the third year, I know you've tried a few different things for full year guidance would be nice to get to a consistent look and feel as to how you do it; I know you've tried giving full year guidance at your Investor Day, last year you gave it on earnings, this time you are doing sort of half and half, but as a suggestion would be good to get it all in one place and in a consistent manner?", "John Haley", "Yeah, I actually think we are doing same thing this year as we did last year which is to, our plan was to give it at Analyst Day, but then we have some very inquisitive analysts Ashwin who follow us who like to get a little bit of a preview during this call.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Please proceed.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Company", "Yeah, just one more question maybe on the ERP system. Why were the issues some more concentrated in the retirement practice than elsewhere in the business? It seems like that\u2019s where you describe the most the impact being?", "John Haley", "Yes, it\u2019s more in retirement, more in Benefits than Talent and Rewards, but retirement obviously is a huge part of Benefits. You know, for one thing, so why is it less concentrated in Risk and Financial Services. They are less on the, if you take brokerage, not really impacted all, kind of what the change impact for the most part are the kind of pure hours and rates and fixed billing consulting parts of the company, so again, you know, more retirement. Also impacted TAS and Talent and Rewards.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Company", "I mean were there smaller impacts on those other areas that you just didn\u2019t call out or was it really that concentrated?", "John Haley", "No, they were smaller impacts that we didn\u2019t call out in. Again retirements, the retirement is 40% of the company. Don\u2019t know often how much it is at North America, but you know, we called out the areas that have the biggest impact on the company.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Company", "And then on Extend, your comment that it would proforma kind of be 20% growth, if I look back at the historical, I think that implies kind of like $18 million of revenue; is that the right way to think about it and differential be in the write off of preferred?", "Roger Millay", "That\u2019s the right way to think about it.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Company", "And then so I think you said before kind of $15 million of deferred will be written off, so as the bulk of that going to be felt in the first half of the year as well?", "", "Roger Millay", "Yeah it is.", "", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Company", "And that\u2019s pure profit, I mean do you, that doesn\u2019t fall straight to the bottomline that so another word would be a $1 million loss?", "", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, it\u2019s pure profit because it was just our deferred revenue that Extend had on its balance sheet that if they hadn\u2019t been acquired would have just come through revenue; there are no associated costs or anything and so we lose the benefit of that pure profit.", "", "Tim McHugh - William Blair & Company", "And then lastly on Extend just the, I think your comment was it\u2019s tracking better than kind of the 30% growth you had anticipated, is that 30% kind of proforma, was that proforma growth without taking out the deferred revenue impact; so I am trying to understand is it 30% times $67 million they did last year or is it, just walk us through?", "", "Roger Millay", "The comment was around enrollments and so I think John gave that saying that -- and of course what we are talking about in the seasonality and the revenue behavior, this all ties together. So I think what John said was that they are tracking to an enrollment period here in this fall that is supportive of the at least 30% level that we had talked about previously. And you are right, so there is a relationship between what we talked about in revenues and how they enroll, but I think John\u2019s comment was more on enrollments.", "And so that really the purpose of saying that is just to say what we see in the early months of the acquisition here, what\u2019s going in their business is supportive of the model that we use to value the business. And of course, the fact that enrolling a lot of people, so not only is there a seasonality, but actually during that seasonal period where you a have a high enrollment period, the financial impact is exacerbated, because they add more temporary people to add for the big enrollment period.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Jeff Volshteyn - JP Morgan", "Just following up on Extend, there is a stock comp adjustment in this quarter, is it a one time or is it an ongoing stock compensation?", "Roger Millay", "It\u2019s not ongoing; they had some options because they were positioning to go public and we carried those over; kind of we look at it from merger acquisition point of view; it was very similar to the restricted stock program that Towers then had coming into the Towers Watson merger and so we carried those unvested options over from Extend structure into Towers Watson, so that\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s not an ongoing program.", "Jeff Volshteyn - JP Morgan", "And I know you have been working with Extend since I think August 2011, how have your sales force been trained, what\u2019s the progress on being able to fully understand their product services and so for your core sales force?", "John Haley", "Well, our healthcare consultants have work with our clients to evaluate all sorts of aspects of what they could do with our healthcare plans and they retiree population for those who have retiree medical is a big part of that. And so we\u2019ve looked at exchanges as one possible solution around retiree medical and our consultants had looked at what was available on the marketplace and concluded that Extend Health was the premier exchange solution and so they have been working with them in that fashion is understanding a client problem how do we deal with it and extend offer the best solution to that which is continuing right now that Extend as part of us. ", "Jeff Volshteyn - JP Morgan", "So the ramp up for sales folks was basically not small?", "John Haley", "Right.", "Jeff Volshteyn - JP Morgan", "And on a bigger picture question, we are getting closer to the November elections, you mentioned increased interest in healthcare consulting post the core decision, are there any dynamics in the elections now that your clients are asking about and sort of republican administration versus democratic administration, how will that change the dynamic and demand for healthcare services?", "John Haley", "Well, I think clients probably have those kinds of questions. I'm not sure that they, I'm not sure anybody has a definitive answer to exactly how that's going to play out so we might get questions about what if new administration would this or what if the existing administration would try to do this. But I don't think there's necessarily any pattern to that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with SunTrust.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "", "I wanted to ask you a question about what the ultimate benefits of the ERP implementation might look like?", "Roger Millay", "So maybe two themes there, first is we had to, we didn't have one ERP system to run the company. So that's why its part of integration because the two legacy companies, you know, basically had pretty almost complete overlap and product areas and we need to put teams together. You know, we couldn\u2019t run the business on one system. So is facilitating running the company. You know, there are some cost savings in the corporate area that will have been coming out and will continue to come out you know, as we said all along, not huge numbers that are going to move the margins at this point. ", "They have been gradually coming out but to the extent that there are savings here over the next several quarters, you know, will either be spending of the environment that we are in. you know, what we said a few quarters ago was reinvesting in growth and that\u2019s if the environment is supportive of that. You know, we would have that option but otherwise, it's embedded in the margin guidance that we\u2019ve been giving.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "Thanks and then I guess in the QA opportunity to kind of collect on the bills in normalizes not (inaudible) but is there an ongoing negative impact assuming in the first quarter guidance?", "Roger Millay", "No, I mean we really kind of any state was assumed in the guidance. So there is not, we wouldn\u2019t have allowed people to forecast quite frankly continued difficulties. So you know, we\u2019re holding ourselves to the standard of holding study and improving overtime you know, and then hopefully gradually recovering some of those reserves that I talked about earlier.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "Okay and I was wondering if you could comment on what you are seeing in the more cyclical part of the Talent and Rewards you talk about the discretionary spending in Europe are moderating just kind of any color you can give us on the scenarios in the coal mine that you have in your business? Thanks.", "", "Roger Millay", "Yeah I think what you tend to see in these environments and again it\u2019s pretty isolated for us really the two places that they said that we saw it manifested this quarter is just you start to see people talking about clients talking about while we anticipated doing this project but it\u2019s delayed we are not sure and you go through some period where they don\u2019t just cancel projects but you are kind of in limbo and then projects come through and so that\u2019s the environment that we have seen develop over the last couple of quarters. ", "It stayed pretty isolated to those areas that we have been talking about really overall, so at the moment it\u2019s not as dramatic a downturn as we saw in the Talent Rewards business back in the \u201808, \u201809 period but we are as we said in I think in the remarks we are very watchful of whether that trend is going to become more significant.", "John Haley", "And I think as we have talked in the first three quarters of the fiscal year EMEA was surprisingly strong especially in Talent and Rewards. Now in the fourth quarter the revenues for Rewards, Talent and Communication dropped by 10%, the exact comp was up by 4% but then we also saw in data service and technology drop in European sales in the fourth quarter. So I think one of the reasons we have been cautions throughout the whole year about EMEA was just that we might see a bit of drop we have seen one of that in the fourth quarter and I guess the question now is just what we are we likely to see going into 2013. ", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "Right that makes sense and just one clarification with the margin guidance you have in the first quarter what kind of articulated expectation of similar 90% and 90.5% for year? Does that imply like the back half you are going to be may be you have a big 20% or higher normalized to the overall annual rent?", "John Haley", "The cyclicality of the exchange solutions will help us in the back half. First thing in the first quarter it will help us to similar extent in the back half.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W Baird. Please proceed. ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "One more question just to understand the ERP situation just a little bit better is the primary bottleneck occurring at the consultant level or is it you know within payables and receivables within the finance function or is it at the client we are just not receiving the information correctly or perhaps not being in agreement with it?", "Roger Millay", "Well the with exception perhaps certainly not being in agreement whether part I know I think it is in all areas that\u2019s what happens in these situations when you have a delay and you have some ambiguities around the information which in some circumstances we've had here and so it's in all areas. I mean the way the whole billing and collections area works for us is the consultants on the front line of the business are very involved in that and so whether it's -- let's say regardless of who is actually making a specific collections call let's say it's not done without the input of the consultants. So it circles around the front end of the business, but the process, challenges that we've had involve all three areas I think that you mentioned.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "Okay, but there's no sense that this has changed something in terms of the way that the clients perceive the bills and no disagreement from the perspective in terms of the value of the services rendered.", "John Haley", "No. Not like that.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "And then with regard to Extend, just to understand the deferred to a greater extent, if we think about last year they ended up doing roughly $67 million and do we just strip out the $15 million in deferred and think of that as being kind of our base level of revenue that we are going to build off of for this 20% to 30% growth. Is that one way to think about it?", "Roger Millay", "I think we maybe mixing [queries] there a little bit but because you are talking about the 20% to 30% growth. So we are talking about growth rates both from a pro forma point of view as well as what we are going to experience. So when we've been talking about the 30%, yeah that is pro forma assuming that they got the deferred revenue on the same pattern that they would have if they were independent. So I think maybe that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying by adding it back.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "Right. So, I am just saying 30% growth on top of what base should we?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, it's on top of their historic base. So the 67 million for their FY12.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "But then stripping out the deferred?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I mean, it's really adding to the deferred back to fiscal 2013. Right because that\u2019s when they would have got.", "John Haley", "Here is the way to think of it. We will have a growth rate that will get us -- on the 67 million we will have some growth. We will take 15 million out of that. And after we take the 15 million out of it, we still will have a 30% growth rate.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "Okay, so I mean everything is going according to plan from that perspective and that should be highly profitable in the first half of fiscal 2013?", "John Haley", "Everything is going to plan or better.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "And then can you just talk a little bit about the impact with regards to derisking on the retirement side \u2013 the projects that you\u2019re seeing and what happens to the follow on work or how does that tail look post a de-risking exercise and I am assuming when you're talking about de-risking, we\u2019re talking about some of the things that Ford and GM have been in the news about recently?", "John Haley", "Yeah, so when we look at those kind of activities where they are -- in the one case, you\u2019re basically offering lump sums to existing retirees and in the other case you are -- it\u2019s a mixture of lump sums and annuitizing the pension liabilities. In cases where companies are offering lump sums there is a business boost for us potentially in our TAS because of the administration around the lump sum offering.", "Also retirement and some of our communications work -- can come into play, where they are additionally doing the annuitizing of pension liabilities we could get work in RCS in brokerage and investments in addition to the others.", "RCS really has the relationships and understands how to structure insurance products so we could help consult with the insurance companies who might be interested in this market. So I think that you get potentially any or all of those can get involved in some of those kind of derisking.", "When we are talking about things where the derisking is basically taking out liabilities for retires in these fashion, that won\u2019t tend to affect the ongoing work that we would do around say pension valuations and other work that we would do for the retirement plan because the retirement plan itself is an ongoing entity.", "It\u2019s just that some of the retiree liability has been stripped out of it. I mean you could conceive of other derisking where you had a complete buyout of the pension plan and you just terminated it or sold it to an insurance company or something. Those things are much harder to do, those are kind of things that could affect our ongoing work there.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "And so basically the things that are occurring have no negative impact on the ongoing work, but at the same time for right short term project work?", "Roger Millay", "That\u2019s correct.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "And then with regards to your own pension liability is there impact we should think about with regards to comp for this coming fiscal year as it relates to that.", "Roger Millay", "With regards to comp?", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "Yes, like how much you are going to end up expensing for pensions?", "Roger Millay", "So you see that the liability on the balance sheet is increased this quarter and that is driven by the discount rates being so low at this point and expense will be up in fiscal 2013 and we will have more color on that in the analyst day for the guidance.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "I mean that\u2019s all in encapsulated within the 19 to 19.5?", "Roger Millay", "It is. It is all encapsulated there, yeah.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen since there are no further questions in queue I would now like to turn call over to Mr. Haley for closing remarks.", "John Haley", "Okay well thank very much everyone for joining us on this morning. We look forward to seeing you at Analyst Day which will be on September 14 and we look forward to reviewing our first quarter results with you in November.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today Ms. Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Aida Sukys", "Good morning. Welcome to the Towers Watson earnings call. I am here today with John Haley, Towers Watson\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please refer to our website for this morning\u2019s press release. Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available for replay via telephone for the next week by dialing 617-801-6888, confirmation number 68111995.

Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this earnings call.", "During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. For a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the mostly closely comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release and the accompanying financial tables we posted this morning.", "After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks Aida. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we\u2019ll review our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. ", "Before we get into the results, I just want to say a few words about Sandy, the storm that devastated so much of the east coast of the United States. Many of our associates and their families were directly in the path of the storm. Thankfully none of our associates or their families were injured. However many sustained property loss and continue to be without power and basic necessities as of today. It\u2019s wonderful to see our colleagues join together to provide assistance to one another not just to cover claim work but to help each other as friends in this time in need. Our best wishes go out to each of you.", "Now getting to the results. Reported revenues for the quarter were $834 million. Reported and organic revenues increased 3% over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5%. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures.", "Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $150 million or 17.9% of revenues. That\u2019s a decrease of - from $162 million or 19.9% of revenues last year. The decrease was driven in large part by the business cycle of exchange solutions. As a reminder, the exchange solution business incurred significant costs in the first half of the fiscal year as we ramped up temporary staff to enroll new members during the annual enrolment period. Revenues are recognized over the annual policy period which is typically effective on January 1.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.82 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.30. The impact of exchange solutions on diluted earnings per share was $0.13 and the impact on adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.07. We\u2019re very pleased with the overall results this quarter and seeing good momentum in certain lines of business. However the momentum is not consistent across all segments or regions. ", "Discretionary spending in EMEA continues to be down and we\u2019re seeing pockets of more conservative spending in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions. However despite the challenging economic indicators all regions posted revenue growth this quarter. Given the economic news and the cautionary messages being delivered during this earning season, we continue to monitor the global economic situation closely. Our global and regional leaders are working with the management teams on the ground actively managing the business market by market in this very dynamic environment. I remain confident in the strength of our management team and growth strategy to deliver profitable growth through this challenging economic environment. ", "Now let\u2019s look at the performance of each of our segments. On an organic basis, Benefits grew 2.5%, Risk and Financial Services grew 1% and Talent and Rewards grew 3%. On a pro forma basis, Exchange Solutions grew 27%. For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $457 million. Benefits segment revenues were up 2.5% on a constant currency basis. ", "The Americas region constant currency revenues were up 5% and EMEA\u2019s constant currency revenues decreased by 2%. The economic environment in EMEA has certainly had an impact on EMEA results as have some other one-off factors such as additional vacation during the Olympics in the UK.", "Retirement revenues increased by 3% on a constant currency basis driven by a 7% increase in the Americas revenues. The pipeline of work continues to look good, particularly in the areas of derisking and lump-sum projects. Both the UK and Germany\u2019s results were below expectations. While much of the revenue shortfall in Germany was related to timing, in the UK the auto enrolment activity has been slower to pick up than expected but we\u2019re now seeing a stronger new business pipeline in that area. ", "The business environment in the UK is more challenging. While derisking is still a strong driver of business, we\u2019re experiencing delays with clients\u2019 decision making process, especially around discretionary projects and the competitive landscape is generally more difficult. ", "Technology and administration solutions revenues increased by mid-single digits on a constant currency basis. All regions experienced growth this quarter and the pipeline is strong especially in EMEA. We had low single digit constant currency revenue growth in health and group benefits. The slower growth this quarter is attributable to less special project work than in previous quarters likely due in part to employers seeming to have stayed on the sidelines waiting for the outcome of the November elections. Going forward the benefits segment should continue to show modest growth in all three lines of business. ", "Now let me turn to risk and financial services. For the quarter the risk and financial services segment had revenues of $192 million. Revenues were up 1% on a constant currency basis led by growth in EMEA. Risk consulting and software increased by 2% on a constant currency basis driven by consulting services in Americas and strong software revenues in EMEA. Increased M&A activity drove growth in life consulting while conditions remained challenging in EMEA. We\u2019re pleased with the activity in the Americas and Asia-Pacific but remain cautious about Europe as discretionary spend continues to be tightening. ", "Brokerage revenues declined by 2% on a constant currency basis across all markets against strong comparables in quarter one of FY\u201912. Renewal revenues are higher than last year. However completed new business is running behind the prior year. Investment had low single-digit constant currency growth in both the Americas and EMEA regions. We continue to feel confident in the investment pipeline. Overall we expect risk and financial services to maintain its positive momentum. ", "Next, let's move onto talent and rewards. For the quarter the talent and rewards segment had revenues of $140 million with revenues up 3% on a constant currency basis. While market dynamics for this segment haven\u2019t changed in the last few quarters in that slower decision-making, reductions in discretionary spending and pricing pressures continue to present challenges, our strong position and balanced portfolio provide stability to the business performance. ", "Rewards, talent and communication, the portion of our T&R business that\u2019s the most project oriented, declined by 5%. Revenue declines in the Americas and EMEA region were partially offset by strong growth in Asia-Pacific. Data surveys and technology revenues increased by 14% on a constant basis driven by the Americas and Asia-Pacific. This growth is primarily due to timing of revenue recognition as a number of our compensation surveys were delivered to clients earlier than forecasted this year. ", "Executive compensation revenues slightly declined on a constant currency basis. With the neutral regulatory environment and stable client base, we feel we\u2019re well-positioned in this area in spite of the uncertain economic environment. We will most likely continue to see mixed results in the talent and rewards lines of businesses over the next few quarters given the uncertainty in the market and the pressure most global organizations are experiencing. While our first-quarter performance gives us more confidence about the year we\u2019re still expecting a modest overall decline in this segment\u2019s revenues for the whole year. ", "Lastly, I would like to move to the exchange solutions segment. For the quarter the exchange solutions segment had revenues of $14 million net of deferral revenue required by purchase accounting rules. On a pro forma basis, excluding the $6 million deferred revenue write-off from the acquired balance sheet required by purchase accounting rules, revenues were $20 million for a 27% growth rate. ", "We had a very successful sales season. In our first 25 business days, we've already enrolled more than 50,000 new members more than we enrolled during the entire annual enrolment process last year. We anticipate having approximately 350,000 members for the January 1st policy period. We continue to be very excited about the future of exchange solutions. Given the strong momentum and our market and thought leadership position in the exchange industry, we anticipate strong and profitable revenue growth over the next few years. ", "In conclusion, we had a very good first quarter but certainly feel the need for prudent management during this environment. We feel positive about the pipeline activity and have every confidence in our long-term growth strategies and our leadership team. ", "Before I turn the call over Roger, I\u2019d like to congratulate Linda Rabbitt, our lead director for being awarded the Director of The Year for 2012 by the National Association of Corporate Directors. This award recognizes two distinguished individual directors a year who serve as role models in promoting exemplary board leadership, oversight excellence, and courage in the board room. This is a tremendous honor, and we\u2019ve been extremely fortunate to have Linda on our board for the last 10 years.", "Now I will turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks John and good morning to everyone. As John mentioned, our business had a strong first quarter as a result of top line growth which helped drive the adjusted EBITDA margin ahead of our guidance. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition accounting and transaction and integration costs. ", "For the quarter, the benefits segment had a 30% NOI margin. Risk and financial services had a 19% NOI margin and talent and rewards had an 18% NOI margin. Exchange solutions had an NOI loss as a result of their seasonal ramp-up for the annual enrolment period. ", "Net income attributable to controlling interest for the quarter was $59 million. Adjusted net income was $82 million. This quarter we had $9 million of transaction and integration costs versus $21 million last quarter and $21 million in last year's first quarter. The majority of the costs in this line continue to be related to our large IT initiatives, integrating both the ERP software and hardware platforms of the company.", "The hardware platform project has been completed. The New Oracle ERP system is deployed throughout the Americas and virtually all of EMEA. We\u2019ve started our phase deployment in the Asia-Pacific region as well. The ERP system now covers more than 95% of our revenues and we\u2019re on schedule to complete the last phase of deployment in February 2013. ", "The tax rate for the quarter was 36% and the forecasted rate was 37%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.82. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.13. The impact of exchange solutions on diluted earnings per share was $0.13 and the impact on adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.07, including the interest charges associated with financing the Extend Health acquisition. ", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. At September 30 we had $329 million in cash available for our use. We had a free cash outflow of $202 million as we paid our bonuses and funded our pension plans this quarter. The first quarter of the fiscal year is seasonally a heavy period of cash used for the company and free cash flow generally improves through each of the consecutive quarters of the fiscal year. ", "As we conclude our global ERP deployment and integration work, we expect to see strong free cash flow towards the end of fiscal year \u201913. We had $339 million of borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter, which is related to the acquisition of Extend Health, the payment of bonuses and pension funding. This quarter was the heaviest quarter for contributions to our defined benefit pension plans driven by a $50 million contribution to the funded U.S. pension plans in order to maintain fully funded status. ", "We also have $250 million outstanding in our five year term loan which was used to fund the Extend Health purchase. The term loan amortizes at a rate of $6.25 million per quarter beginning in the September quarter of 2013 with a final maturity date of June 1, 2017. ", "Receivables and related reserves increased modestly between June 30 and September 30. We're seeing improved process in North America, but some stress in more recently deployed regions although not at the same level as we initially experienced in North America. We continue to anticipate bringing DSO levels to more normalized levels in the next few quarters. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the board authorized a $150 million stock repurchase program. We have not utilized that authority and are assessing the use of capital on a quarterly basis. Under our anti-dilution repurchase authorization, we purchased 136,000 shares during the fourth quarter and 292,000 shares in the first quarter, a total of 428,000 shares overall to offset the dilution related to the Extend Health options and other stock-based compensation programs. ", "Now let\u2019s review our guidance for fiscal year 2013. Overall we expect revenue to fall in the range of $3.52 billion to $3.6 billion. We're expecting our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be within the range of $5.12 to $5.20. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be within the range of 18.5% to 19%. For the fiscal year, our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of US$1.55 to the British pound at an average exchange rate of US$1.25 to the euro. ", "We expect the fiscal year \u201813 income tax rate to be within the range of 36% to 37% before any impact of resolving ongoing tax examinations. There may be some volatility in the effective tax rate quarter to quarter. The second-quarter income tax rate is expected to be in the 37% to 38% range due to the restructuring of legal entities related to the merger integration and the ERP deployment. The restructuring may negatively impact our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.03, which has been incorporated into our second-quarter guidance. ", "As noted above, the completion of tax examinations which may lower the rate in upcoming quarters is not included in the fiscal year guidance. We expect diluted shares outstanding to be about 72 million. We expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share. ", "Now we will review our fiscal year guidance for the segments. We expect constant currency revenue growth in the benefits segment to be in the low single digit range for the fiscal year. The NOI margin for benefits is expected to be in the low 30% range. ", "Next, in the risk and financial services segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 5% for the fiscal year. This business is highly dependent on project work and where we come out on this range is dependent on the business environment and related project activity. We expect the NOI margin to be in the mid-20% range. ", "In the talent and rewards segment, we expect constant currency revenue to be flat to a low single digit decline for the fiscal year. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low to mid-teens range. Lastly, in the exchange solutions segment, we expect pro forma revenue growth of around 30% for the fiscal year, which is net of about $12 million of deferred revenue write-off required by GAAP purchase accounting rules. We expect the NOI margin to be in the mid-to high single digit range which includes the impact of the deferred revenue write-off. ", "Overall I am very pleased with our performance for the quarter and I am optimistic about our continued growth. Before I turn the call back to John, I'd like to echo John\u2019s best wishes for our associates and their families who were impacted by the devastating storm that hit the East Coast last week. The recovery from the damage and related infrastructure issues has been gradual and difficult. It isn\u2019t really possible to say at this point how much this will impact our business. ", "Now I will turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks Roger and now we will take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer of SunTrust.", "Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust", "Roger, you described some disruption in the more recent markets that you've rolled out the ERP but not quite as much as the U.S. Could you give us a little color on the kind of impact that\u2019s having and then where you sit as far as recovering some of the older receivables?", "Roger Millay", "So in general, we are seeing as you might expect as we go from region to region, we\u2019re seeing some stabilization of the earlier regions that were deployed particularly Canada and the U.S. And reserve levels of didn't move anywhere near the way they moved in the June quarter and a real stabilization in process, and actually as we turned the corner on the quarter into October we just started to see the impact -- positive impact of those developments. And so hence again our expectations for the year at this point continue to be that we'll see progress in the earliest deployed regions. ", "As you go kind of location by location or country by country as we\u2019ve been deploying in Europe, you see some of the same sort of stresses that it takes folks some time to get used to the new billing processes and there might be some lag in the unbilled as a result of that, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a spike up in the age receivables, but again nowhere near the level that we saw in the early days in North America. ", "John Haley", "If I could just maybe add \u2013 I guess we always thought as we rolled it out that if things went pretty well, we would just see a little disruption. There would always be some frictional costs to rolling this thing out and I think what we're seeing in the latest rollouts is close to that situation that we were hoping for. So we feel pretty good about those.", "Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust", "And then John, I think in your prepared remarks, I heard you describe competitive environment in the UK that was a little bit I guess more competitive. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what you meant by that?", "John Haley", "I think I was thinking about talent and rewards, so wasn\u2019t I there when I was talking about the slower decision-making, reduction in discretionary spending and pricing pressures continuing to present challenges that was really around the market dynamics for talent and rewards. And I think we\u2019re seeing all of those. I think with the talent and rewards, we\u2019ve seen particularly in rewards, talent and communication we\u2019ve seen some declines in both the Americas and EMEA. We've had some somewhat strong growth in Asia-Pacific, but that's the dynamic. ", "Europe, I am not sure that we can characterize Europe just one way for the organization as a whole, because although it's more competitive \u2013 or there are some of market dynamics that are putting pressure on us in talent and rewards particularly in rewards, talent and communication. Actually RCS has done reasonably well in EMEA, that was one of the leaders there and then the retirement or the benefits in EMEA has really been held back us as much by some regulatory delays as anything. ", "Tobey Sommer \u2013 SunTrust", "And my last question to you Roger, I think you described some initiatives that over a period of time may reduce the tax rate and I was wondering if you could tell us what your expectation is for kind of the ultimate impact of the initiatives you have underway?", "Roger Millay", "So I am not sure when you say I described some initiatives, and maybe you\u2019re referring to earlier discussions of the merger. So maybe I will answer in two things and one of the two of them will your question. For this year actually we do have the potential of a lower tax rate as a result of we expect to have some year settled with IRS here in the next quarter or two and that may result in the release of some reserves Fin 48 reserves that we had. So that\u2019s kind of the item that I talked about for this year. ", "I think in the longer-term I did reference a write-off and a tax cost that we expect here in the December quarter as a result of consolidation of legal entities. That's something that's been ongoing as a result of merger activity kind of paralleling the ERP rollout and as we continue to kind of get the platform that we expect longer-term from a legal entity point of view that's one of the activities that we think will lead to a lower tax rate. And actually I think I really didn\u2019t go back and look at it but I think the guidance now of 36% to 37% for the year is one of the lower tax rates we\u2019ve had or perhaps the lowest tax rate we\u2019ve had for a year since we merged. So I think we\u2019re been gradually winding things up. Where it's going to end up is difficult to say this point, but we are hopeful of getting a point or two here this year and perhaps more in the future years. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "First just wanted to ask, relative to the investor day in mid September, I think you had said that you thought you would be towards the lower part of the guidance range and you obviously came above. And so is that a signal that you finished on a pretty strong note or I guess what came in better than you thought at that time?", "Roger Millay", "I think the big thing Tim, was around and I think John described it the strength in data services and around the surveys. When we looked in August and early September at the results that we were achieving and that we expected where we were going to come out in surveys delivered, which is what drives revenue recognition that was the real difficult to call end of September versus October. We ended up closing and delivering a lot of the surveys into September so that was really the biggest item that was kind of a jump ball and we were little conservative where we gave the guidance. ", "John Haley", "And I think the other thing is that when we were looking at this in September, we were looking at some results from July and then partially from August. But that those were months where in Europe we believe we were impacted by the Olympics and so it was probably a little bit lower that we were projecting on, then it ultimately came out.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "I guess just the bonus accruals year over year looked to be down a little. Can you talk about how you approach that, is that a reflection of some of this seasonality of the revenue or is it a reflection of just trying to be conservative about maintaining margins, what would be the outlook kind of for the year as we think about those bonus accruals versus last year?", "John Haley", "We\u2019re accruing this year on the right at the percentage of NOI that we target. And that we've been targeting in all of our discussions over the last several years. Last year during the first quarter, which was a very first quarter we were looking forward to uncertain results for the less of the last year, we had a much higher than normal accrual.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "So this is just more normal?", "John Haley", "This is a normal one this year.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "For the exchange business, is the deferred revenue impact going to be similar in the second quarter here?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah I think it\u2019s about the same, so $6 million in the first quarter and it was what $14 million for the year. So yeah second quarter it will be lower in the second half of the year. So we expect this quarter \u2013 this second quarter to be about the same.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "And can you give us a sense that you talked about more new enrolments in that business in just the last few weeks, then off less enrolment period, what\u2019s kind of \u2013 I assume you have a pretty good idea now at this point, what the overall enrolment growth if you will is going to be by the end of this enrolment period. So what\u2019s the underlying type of growth rate in the number of enrolments on the platform at this point?", "John Haley", "Well, as we mentioned, we are expecting to be at about 350,000 enrollments as of January 1 and last year I believe we were somewhere around, it was below 250,000, was maybe in the 220,000 range or something like that. So that gives you a sense of the enrollment increase there. It\u2019s a pretty hefty increase. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re so excited about this business. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio of Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Just wondering if there is any way to size the impact from those surveys, was it worth the three points to growth that we saw or is it less than that? And then second, just to follow up on Tobey\u2019s questions on the ERP recovery, I think we\u2019re all thinking of a $20 million number that was written off. I just wondered if you'd written \u2013 were that write off or stood relative to the $20 million we talked about last quarter? ", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, so and you will have to remind me probably what both questions were as I get going here. But that\u2019s right. So in terms of the $20 million from last quarter, of course that comparison changes every quarter as we had reserve activity in September did not come down. So in fact, they increased a bit but they also increased a bit in the September quarter last year. So the reserves didn\u2019t \u2013 again if you think of revenues and the P&L reserves didn't really have an impact this quarter and we haven't brought reserves down. So that's still to come, hopefully as we continue to wind things up. The good news is that we stabilized much more this quarter. ", "In terms of the 3%, in terms of the impact of the surveys, I mean that was the area of the business that most outperformed what T&R would have been with -- I think that was your question without that excess it certainly accounted for most of the growth. I think we could look but it may well have been negative without that outperformance of surveys.", "John Haley", "But maybe your question Paul, is that real growth that will contribute to the whole year and the answer is no. Some of it was released in a large portion that was really growth that was brought forward because surveys that would've been delivered in either the end of September or early October got delivered in September. ", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "And I know that European PMI this morning looked a little bit weak. Not your same end market but Decko (ph) was saying that Europe seemed to be stabilizing particularly southern Europe. But I know you think things are spotty but does that sound right to you or you think of it \u2013 you\u2019re not thinking it\u2019s that clear?", "John Haley", "I think it \u2013 I guess what, I might say it a different way. It doesn\u2019t seem wrong to us. It's just that I think we just don't know. We\u2019re just uncertain about Europe. And I think I mentioned it at analyst day the difficulty we had in doing guidance this year more so than in any other year. I've seen where we see lots of opportunities for growth sort of grafted onto this really uncertain and troubling macroeconomic environment. And it gives us some pause and exactly what to project. So we see things in Europe that we see as real growth opportunities but then we also see some real problems among our clients. So it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag like that. I think that's one reason why we\u2019re not projecting, things are falling off a cliff by any means at all in Europe but we\u2019re just somewhat cautious about it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. ", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Just to continue to beat the horse of ERP, what\u2019s going on? DSO were flat sequentially and was there any progress in general to bring it down or can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of the reserves going up through the quarter? Was that in the issue of Americas going down and some of the newer regions going up, can you just give us more detail there?", "Roger Millay", "I think it was more \u2013 I think the Americas were kind of flattish really, so again I used the word stabilized earlier, and I think that's the way we think about it. And if I would characterize the improvement we definitely saw an improvement in process and again where our goals were it translate that improvement in process into an improvement in DSO levels in this 12/31 quarter. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re targeting there. It is offset by a little bit of increase in reserves and agings in EMEA, again which I think John characterized it well is not shocking probably at levels that are more what we anticipated but not a big increase. ", "John Haley", "Shlomo, the real question is are we going to be able to recover some of this? And it\u2019s really in the next quarter that we\u2019re going to have to try to do this we think in the Americas. Now you may remember at analyst day, we set our guidance for the quarter didn\u2019t they contain anything for improvement in the reserves in the Americas. We\u2019re just looking to stabilize it this quarter and we\u2019ve done that but I don\u2019t whether we will be able to recover any of that but if we do, we\u2019re going to have to do it reasonably quickly.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "So the past 12/31 basically whatever you get and then after that the Americans you shouldn't expect lowering of DSOs because of the ERP, is that what you are saying?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I am not sure when you say lowering of DSOs because of the ERP, I mean we should -- we have to get ourselves to a point where we\u2019re at more normal levels and I think what John is saying is really the longer things they age, there is a point at which you just don't go back and clients get passed the budget here and it\u2019s just too old. So our press is very hard right now to collect as much as possible in December quarter. ", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "Let me ask you directly. Besides what\u2019s going on with the ERP system is there any other change in the underlying levels of DSO, are there any issues that are going on there to make DSO elevated?", "Roger Millay", "No.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "And then in terms of your guidance, are you expecting Europe to continue to decline in particular areas? What have you factored for your guidance?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I think John characterized it well and I think we projected pretty much a continuation of where we are now. So talent and rewards has been declining in EMEA and we expect that in our guidance to continue for this year, and that's probably the biggest area of decline. ", "John Haley", "Right. I think benefits we noted a decline in EMEA but we think some of that has been related as I said to the auto enrollment work was slow because of delay in implementing regulations. Some the work on the specific forms of derisking to take place in the UK, that\u2019s been hampered by some statements from the pensions minister but I think people are beyond that now. And so we think that those have been delayed, we don't expect to see the same kind declines in the remainder of the year there. ", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "And then reinsurance brokerage, I think all the other major public competitors showed quote from between 1% and 7%. What\u2019s going on over there, why did you guys have a decline?", "Roger Millay", "I mean I will say just from a numbers point of view to start. I think John probably has other things to add. But they had a very strong quarter last year and so really as we look at it I think we were down a couple percent or so and really the new business that came in didn't offset the strength that they saw last year. ", "John Haley", "Yeah, actually that's pretty much what I was going to say so.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus", "And my last question is are you assuming a reasonable amount of lump sum project in retirement to carry you through the rest of this fiscal year or is there something else in retirement that\u2019s picking up?", "John Haley", "Well, we think there\u2019s going to be continuing lump sum or \u2013 I should just say derisking work throughout the remainder the year. The pipeline still seems pretty strong at the moment. It\u2019s not clear to us that it will be as much over the remainder of the fiscal year and so there'll certainly be some that will be helpful to have that. It\u2019s not clear to us that it will necessarily be at the same level. There were some regions around the arbitrage of the interest rate that could be used for lump-sums that cause more activity in the early part of our fiscal year won't necessarily be there for the second half of the fiscal year when people go out and do settlements with insurance companies, that's episodic. So there is no doubt that there\u2019s going to be a fair amount of work whether it will be quite at the level, that\u2019s just not clear. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Volshteyn of JP Morgan.", "Jeff Volshteyn - JP Morgan", "Could you give a little color on the discretionary spend on project work in the Americas and particularly in the benefits business?", "Roger Millay", "I don\u2019t know \u2013 I think John was just talking about the other than, if you call the lump-sum or discretionary certainly that\u2019s the driver in retirement. ", "John Haley", "We don\u2019t tend to characterize \u2013 we don\u2019t characterize our work otherwise as what\u2019s sort of normal ongoing work or discretionary, there's always a fair amount of discretionary work underlying things. I think that my feeling -- we've looked at the lump-sum just because we had to do those differently and we had a different group working on that. But my feeling is that those things eat a little bit into other project work that you might have and so you probably have other discretionary work is lower than it might have been in the absence of the lump-sum. But overall the total discretionary work is higher. ", "Jeff Volshteyn - JP Morgan", "And then for the remainder of the year do you expect to make any additional payments towards the pension plan?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, there will be some continuing contributions to the defined benefit pensions but the full contribution as I said the biggest quarter that we will have this year has been this past quarter. But there are still some to go particularly in the UK and in Canada but not at this \u2013 not anymore in the U.S.", "Jeff Volshteyn - JP Morgan", "Is there a way to quantify (inaudible) or what percentage of payment this quarter?", "Roger Millay", "I think we\u2019ve made roughly like I don\u2019t know 60% or 70% of what we\u2019re going to do for the year. So it\u2019s about $70 million contributions to the defined benefit plans this quarter, and that's about 60 or probably about two thirds of the year I think. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Just on a couple quick things. The DaVinci acquisition, where that segment is going to show up and what did you expect the contribution for this quarter or for this year?", "John Haley", "So the DaVinci that\u2019s the consulting group that we acquired just on November 1, so that\u2019s in the second quarter here. They'll be joining the RCS life group, they are in (inaudible). And what they do is they bring a specialty in the long-term care space. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "And financial \u2013", "John Haley", "It\u2019s a couple million, it\u2019s 2 to 2.5 million in incremental revenue for the whole fiscal year. A slight negative NOI due to some hiring bonuses.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "Just thinking about the drivers at this point from a margin expansion perspective, when we think about the remainder of 2013 or fiscal \u201813 what are you guys sort of seeing as the most important drivers for the margin target that you played out right now?", "Roger Millay", "Well, we\u2019re in an environment of low organic growth and so I would say cost management discipline given again at the topline expectations are pretty subdued. As you look at what will change margins the most for us as the year goes on I think it\u2019s going to be the rolling in of the full picture on exchange solutions. Their margins and their impact on the company\u2019s margins will be pretty notable in the second half of the year. So I think for our margins and the guidance that we\u2019ve given around margin it\u2019s bringing exchange solutions in the second half of the year. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "And just remind me what was the NOI target for the exchange solutions part for fiscal \u201913?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah what we have said was mid-to high single digit range. ", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "And then just longer-term anything to call out on the potential impact of financial reform Dodd-Frank or anything around the healthcare reforms you guys are thinking about it and development changes in the way that clients are approaching you guys, can you address one of those issues?", "John Haley", "I think on healthcare I think clients are just waiting to see what the outcome of the election is. We've seen a noticeable downturn as a result of that. We expect things to pick up once there\u2019s some certainty which way we\u2019re headed. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America.", "David Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi this is David Ridley-Lane on behalf of Sara Gubins. John, when the ERP project is complete later this fiscal year, when could you start to see some of the cost savings from that come through? I am just trying to get a sense with the timing around the payback on the cost and that trouble of the ERP system?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, so really the ERP system was mostly focused on finance IT and HR costs. We have been just like the regional rollout that we talked about in that regional impact on receivables, we have been gradually taking out some costs over time as a result of the deployments. It's not a huge number units, there is a big impact on margins but again that's multimillions of dollars but gradually sprinkle in over the 18 month deployment period and probably little bit after the deployment period because you tend to finalize the cost take-out after you see stabilization in the region. ", "David Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I guess on the risk and consulting software sub-segment, with the acquisition of EMB the segment has I think one of the highest exposures to EMEA. So what are you seeing in that segment and how has the trends been in the last couple of months particularly for that segment in EMEA?", "John Haley", "Well, risk consulting and software is the segment that had a very good quarter in EMEA. We had very strong software revenues there and of course the software is a lot of that comes from EMB is where that happens. There was also in the life area there we saw increased M&A activity in EMEA. So we\u2019re cautious about Europe but the quarter itself was pretty good for RCS. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of RW Baird.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the margins on the benefits side and specifically I am curious about the strength that you saw in retirement in the Americas driven by the lump-sum. I would've thought that that would have higher incremental margins than the base business. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the margin profile for that part of the business and how we should think about the operating margins within benefits?", "Roger Millay", "Just the general comment I guess I have about margins in benefits is you're perhaps not seeing the strength that you would have seen in comparison period over period because of the fact that we do allocate changes in benefits costs like pensions and medical costs and so that is dampening what comparison would've looked like. And we do have some additional resources particularly in the TAS business as they ramp up for the clients that they got in EMEA which we talked about in the last couple of quarters. So I think there are some offsetting factors that as you say you might have seen higher margins because of the lump-sum activity but it didn\u2019t really show through. ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "And so how should we be thinking about the underlying margin?", "Roger Millay", "Well, not sure I totally followed your question \u2013 ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "In other words, had we not had those pension contribution and some of those other offsetting factors?", "Roger Millay", "Mark, you followed it pretty closely for a while. I think the \u2013 and the big part of benefits of course is both the TAS and the retirement business that came over from Watson Wyatt. But this low 30% range which we\u2019re guiding to for benefits is that's a strong level of margins and still enhanced from the merger and that's still we think a reasonable range for that business to be in. And that's the guidance for this year.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "With regard to your U.S. P&I 1000 type client, what percentage at this point would you anticipate would actually go through either derisking or lump-sum type of exercise? Any feel for that?", "John Haley", "We don\u2019t have a feel where we could give you a number like that market. And the reason is it depends on how the economic environment involves. So it depends on if interest rates for example increase, then some of these things become cheaper to do. On the other hand, we still have the same opportunity cost maybe that you would have looked for. If interest rates increase people who have also sort of derisked from an investment standpoint won\u2019t necessarily get a big benefit from that because the assets and liabilities will be in lockstep. But of it will depend on what happens there. It will depend on what kind of capacity we see in the market for doing some pension buyouts too. And so I think as we model things we could see it from just a relatively small percentage of them up to some significant percentage of our clients going through it and it depends a whole host of factors. ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "I was just thinking if things stay relatively steady, state it seems like the momentum is building up at least in terms of some of the really large Fortune 100 companies that are highly visible whether it\u2019s GM or Ford or Dupont, making some of those steps. I don\u2019t know whether that causes others to move things that same way, if you thought maybe it\u2019s going to be \u2013 ", "John Haley", "I think look, the lump-sum projects we think were clearly going to be seen more of those. Although as I said the biggest benefit to be gotten out to doing the lump-sums was actually if you acted reasonably quickly this year when you still had the arbitrage opportunities those won't necessarily be around. Looks like they won\u2019t be around say going into calendar 2013. It might still be worth doing, but it won\u2019t be as attractive as it had been. In the areas of derisking I think that depends a lot on the just what the overall interest rate environment is like and then again market capacity issues. ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "And would you say that what has occurred thus far is less than 5%. ", "John Haley", "Yes. These are actually -- when these occur these are pretty big projects. ", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "And then any greater sense for what the follow-on business is once they occur?", "John Haley", "Well I sense that the follow-on business more or less is \u2013 it\u2019s more or less the same. After we have \u2013 there\u2019s maybe a little less consulting on plan design and that occurs not a lot. But if the plant is smaller, and if you get rid of a whole class like by offering lump-sums or something folks that maybe you have less to worry about there. But the actuarial, the administration, the investment services, the compliance services that are needed by the plants, they pretty much remain the same. And when you're paying out the lump-sums, say to the retirees or the terminated vestige, what you're doing is you\u2019re taking out the near-term folks, you're not impacting how long the plan\u2019s going to be in existence. So there's not even an effect from that standpoint.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W Baird", "And then with regard to talent and rewards, you\u2019ve given us the margin target for the year. How should we think about that from a seasonality perspective because seems like talent and rewards because of what you mentioned ended up being a little bit stronger with the communications piece coming online towards the end of the quarter. So are you being conservative with regard to talent and rewards margins for the balance of the year?", "John Haley", "Well, I guess I will let Roger comment on that but it\u2019s maybe as an overall characterization, I think talent and rewards clearly did better in this quarter than we thought it would when we were talking at analyst day. Part of that is we think the fact that the projects got delivered but not all of it. Some of those, it\u2019s just the business just did better than we thought it would at the time. But it's not -- so it\u2019s not quite as much better as it looks but it certainly is better to some extent. We still think though that the kind of conditions that led us to be cautious about the year are still there, still largely there. ", "Roger Millay", "Just I think to your point on or your question on seasonality, I think maybe your observation, clearly in talent and rewards the first half is the stronger margin half of the year and one of the drivers of that is the compensation survey activity, which comes in basically in this fall period as we have been discussing.", "Operator", "At this time there are no further questions in the audio queue.", "John Haley", "Okay. Well, thanks very much everyone for joining us on this call. And we look forward to updating you on our second-quarter results in February. Thanks very much.

Please proceed.", "Aida Sukys", "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Towers Watson earnings call. I am here today with John Haley, Towers Watson's Chief Executive Officer; and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please refer to our website for this morning's press release. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay via telephone for the next two weeks by dialing 617-801-6888, confirmation number 30322967. The replay will also be available for the next three months on our website. Our website also contains a few slides that are complementary to today's call. Those slides include certain reconciliation information required by SEC Regulation G.", "This call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involves risks and uncertainties.

Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this earnings call.", "During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. For a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the mostly comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release and the accompanying financial tables we posted this morning. After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we'll review our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 and our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "Reported revenues for the quarter were $946 million, an increase of 8% over prior year reported revenues and up 6% on an organic basis. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 8%. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures.", "Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $178 million or 18.9% of revenues. The prior year adjusted EBITDA was $172 million or 19.5% of revenues. As a reminder, the Exchange Solutions business, which incurred significant cost in the first half of the fiscal year was acquired on May 29, 2012, impacting the year-over-year comparisons.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.15, up 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.48, up 10%. Exchange Solutions seasonality impacts reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.18 and reduced adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.12.", "We're extremely pleased with the overall results this quarter. All segments and regions posted revenue growth and we've normalized the ERP development related receivables and reserves. Roger will talk about the ERP issues in more detail later in the call.", "Economic and regulatory changes helped drive growth this quarter, however, the thought leadership displayed by our consultants, essential to why we've done so well in the marketplace. One good example of this is our bulk lump sum project work. Bulk lump sum work refers to the de-risking process, which allows organizations to pay pension liabilities to certain groups of terminated employees, which reduces pension liabilities.", "Due to the vision of our leadership, we were prepared to quickly penetrate the market and execute the work on very tight deadlines. I am also very excited about the future of Exchange Solutions and the capabilities we've developed to enter the active and pre-65 retiring markets.", "We recently launched OneExchange, the industry's first health benefit solution that leverages both private and public health insurance exchanges. One of the great aspects of the Extend Heath acquisition was how we were able to leverage the technology and process platforms beyond the initial core retiree focus into the broader pre-65 retiree individual in active markets.", "We have the existing leading and most market-proven platform, and it will not require significant investment to expand into the new applications. This puts us in a great position relative to the current market opportunity under the Affordable Care Act. I feel strongly that the market leading standard set by Exchange Solutions in the retire exchange business will continue to lead to great success in these new markets.", "We're also extremely excited about our recently announced strategic alliance with Fidelity. Specifically, Exchange Solutions will work with Fidelity Investments to provide retiring participants, who are coming off company sponsor health plans, access to resources and support to get quality coverage at a price they can afford.", "This agreement will help simplify the transition process for the millions of retiring Americans, as they sift from employer-sponsored medical coverage to the individual Medicare market for health insurance. Fidelity will begin offering this service to its plan sponsor clients during the third quarter, in time for this year's benefit enrollment season, which typically starts in the fall.", "Now, let's look at the performance of each of our segments. On an organic basis, Benefits grew 10%; Risk and Financial Services grew 1.5%; and Talent and Rewards grew 5%; on a pro forma basis, Exchange Solutions grew 33%.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $519 million. Benefits segment revenues were up 10% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to increased project work across all lines of business. In addition, the segment benefited from the normalization of the ERP related reserves.", "The Americas region constant currency reserves increased by 13%, and EMEA's constant currency reserves increased by 6%, retirement revenues increased by 10% on a constant currency basis, driven by a 15% increase in the Americas. The increase in the Americas was primarily due to the bulk lump sum projects that were accounting benefits to our clients related to completing the work by December 31. While we anticipate some of this work continuing into the second half of the fiscal year, we will not experience the volume of work we completed in the first half.", "EMEA retirement revenues were 5%. We saw some pick up in Germany and benefited from an increase in auto enrollment project activity in the U.K. We expect auto enrollment work to continue, but the general business environment in the U.K. continues to be challenging.", "Technology and Administration Solutions revenues increased by 10% on a constant currency basis. EMEA led growth with 13% constant currency increase, as a result of client wins during the last fiscal year. TAS Americas also assisted with the call center work associated with the bulk lump sum project work.", "Health and Group Benefits constant currency revenues increased by high-single digits and the pipeline look solid. Going forward, the Benefits segment should continue to show modest growth in all three lines of business.", "Now, let me turn to Risk and Financial Services. For the quarter, the Risk and Financial Services segment had revenues of $208 million. Revenues were up 1% on a constant currency basis, led by growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. Risk consulting and software revenue declined by 1% on a constant currency basis. Both the Americas and Asia-Pacific grew by double-digits. However, EMEA's revenues declined by 10%.", "EMEA clients continue to be cautious with discretionary spending. In addition, it appears likely that the timeline for European regulators to implement Solvency II may slip beyond 2014, and related project work may not reappear for sometime.", "Brokerage revenues declined by 7% on a constant currency basis. The second quarter was impacted by lower renewals from previous quarters and minimum new business. However, our January 1 renewals went well and we had some good new wins. So our outlook for the second half of the year is stronger.", "Investment had 12% constant currency revenue growth led by EMEA. All regions experienced double-digit growth on very strong FY '12 quarter two comparables. We're having success in deepening relationships with our existing pension clients and broadening our client base beyond pensioned plans to sovereign well plans and insures. We continue to feel confident in the investment pipeline. Overall we expect Risk and Financial Services to slightly improve its current momentum in the second half of the fiscal year.", "Next, let's move on to Talent and Rewards. For the quarter, the Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $176 million, with revenues up 5% on a constant currency basis, led by a 10% increase in EMEA. Europe continues to be a challenging economic environment and we would normally expect different results under these kind of economic conditions.", "However, a number of factors in the quarter contributed to this strong performance, such as regulation in the financial sector, a renewed focus on performance management, communication related to pension changes and organizational changes, and implementation of new HR models. We also have to acknowledge the impact of strong client focus sales and marketing activity.", "Rewards, talent and communication, constant currency revenues increased by 6%, and executive compensation revenues were strong with 16% constant currency revenue growth. Both businesses were led by EMEA. Executive compensation continues to be driven by increased regulation and governance activity, but this is particularly through Europe. ", "As expected, data surveys and technology revenues declined by 2% on a constant currency basis driven by Asia-Pacific. Compensation surveys were delivered earlier than forecasted, which led to favorable timing of revenue recognition and outperforming revenue guidance in the first quarter. While there were some positive factors that worked in our favor this quarter, market dynamics for this segment remained challenging.", "We're feeling somewhat more positive about the overall environment, but as we move into a seasonally slower part of our fiscal year, we expect to continue to see mixed results in Talent and Rewards for the rest of the fiscal year.", "Lastly, I'd like to move to the Exchange Solutions segment. For the quarter, the Exchange Solutions segment had revenues of $16 million, net of deferral revenue required by purchase accounting rules. On a pro forma basis, excluding the $5 million negative accounting adjustments, revenues grew by 33%.", "We just completed a very successful enrollment period and are pleased to announce that we enrolled more than three times the number of members than in each of the last two years, proving the scalability of the process and technology. We've now exceeded our target of 350,000 members.", "As I mentioned earlier in the call, I'm very excited about our recently launched OneExchange, an integrated health insurance exchange solution for active employees and retirees. This is a terrific example of why we thought Extend Health would be such a great fit with Towers Watson.", "The senior management team of Exchange Solutions' work with the multidisciplinary group of Towers Watson consultants to develop this market-leading delivery system. In the spirit of our client first approach to consulting, we took the time to ensure that as we entered this broader active market, and what is clearly a very dynamic period in the evolution of the exchange business, our solution was strongly aligned with our clients needs.", "This powerful new platform will utilize our patented technology, administrative systems and consulting services. I'm certain that OneExchange will maintain Towers Watson position as market leader in the exchange business.", "It's been an exciting week for Exchange Solutions with the launch of OneExchange and the announcement of our strategic alliance with Fidelity. We have great expectations for the Fidelity relationship.", "The reason, the initial alliance between Towers Watson and Extend Health was so successful was with our client-service and quality cultures met so well. And given the quality of Fidelity as an organization, their commitment of delivering high-quality services and products to their clients, we believe the relationship with Fidelity will be just as successful.", "We had a very strong second quarter. And I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our associates for their contributions and efforts. While there were some heroic efforts put forward this quarter, these results are due to the continuous hard work, innovative thinking, and perseverance in a challenging work environment.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks, John, and good morning to, everyone. As John mentioned, our business really delivered this quarter. I'd like to add my thanks to associates for all their efforts.", "As a result of topline growth and some one-time favorable factors, we significantly outpaced our expectations. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition accounting, and transaction and integration costs.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had 36% NOI margin, Risk and Financial Services had 22% NOI margin, and Talent and Rewards had 34% NOI margin. As expected, Exchange Solutions had an NOI loss, as a result of the seasonal ramp up for the annual enrolment period.", "Net income attributable to controlling interest for the quarter was $82 million. Adjusted net income was $107 million. This quarter we had $9 million of transaction and integration costs.", "For the first half of fiscal '13, we've incurred $18 million in transaction and integration costs as compared to $44 million in the first half of fiscal '12. As planned, we will finalize all transaction and integration costs in the third quarter, and expect to be within our guidance range of $30 million to $35 million for the fiscal year.", "As of February 1, we completed the worldwide ERP system deployments with the second rollout in the Asia-Pacific region. The human resources ERP system has also been fully deployed. We can now focus on final stabilization and wind-down activities in the coming months, particularly around the most recent deployments in Asia-Pacific and human resources.", "I'm also extremely pleased to say that we've stabilized and normalized the ERP deployment related receivables and reserves. As of December 31, our DSO was back in the range of historical levels. As I've mentioned in previous calls, we continue to expect receivables to be a bit elevated for several quarters in the geographies that have been recently deployed. But we feel the Americas and most of EMEA are now stabilized and back to business as usual.", "The tax rate for the quarter was 31%. The forecasted rate was a range of 37% to 38%. As part of the continuing integration efforts, legal entity consolidation continues, and this quarter we benefited from a non-recurring U.S. tax benefit on our Australian branch incorporation.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. At December 31, we had $373 million in cash available for our use. During the quarter, we generated $169 million of free cash. Free cash flow generally improves through each of the consecutive quarters of the fiscal year. And as the integration period is concluding, we expect to continue to see strong free cash flow as we complete the fiscal year '13.", "We had $275 million of borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter. We also have $250 million outstanding on our five-year term loan, which was used to fund the Expend Health purchase. During this quarter, we repurchased approximately 370,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $20 million.", "Now, let's review our guidance for fiscal year 2013. Overall, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.60 billion to $3.65 billion. We're expecting our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be within the range of $5.28 to $5.38. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be within the range of 18.5% to 19%.", "For the fiscal year our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of $1.60 dollars to the British pound and an average exchange rate of $1.30 dollars to the Euro. We expect the fiscal year '13 income tax rate to be around 34%, excluding any impact of resolving ongoing tax examinations in the second half of fiscal year '13. These examinations may potentially lower the tax rate in the third or fourth quarters, but this impact is not included in our guidance.", "In addition, we believe we're starting to see the impacts of our restructuring activities in lowering our steady state effective tax rate. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 72 million. We expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share.", "Now, we'll review our fiscal year guidance for the segments. We expect constant currency revenue growth in the Benefits segment, to be in the low-to-mid single-digit range for the fiscal year. The NOI margin for Benefits is expected to be in the low-to-mid 30% range.", "Next, in Risk and Financial Services, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 3% for the fiscal year. This business is highly dependent on project work, and where we come out in this range is dependent on the business environment. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low-to-mid 20% range.", "In the Talent and Reward segment, we expect constant currency revenue to be roughly flat for the fiscal year. This segment has had good execution in a tough environment with a disciplined approach to marketing, staffing and cost management. We expect the NOI margin to be in the high-teens range.", "Lastly, in the Exchange Solutions segment, we expect pro forma revenue growth of around 35% for the fiscal year, which is net of about $12 million of deferred revenue write-off required by GAAP purchase accounting rules. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low-double digit range, which includes the impact of the deferred revenue write-off.", "There will be no material impact to the FY '13 forecast, as a result of OneExchange and the strategic alliance with Fidelity. As John mentioned previously, we're leveraging the current Exchange Solutions platform to develop OneExchange. So we don't see that any meaningful investment will be required.", "OneExchange and Fidelity marketing efforts will focus on the 2014 enrollment periods. As we've discussed in the past, due to the seasonality of the exchange business cycle, we expect revenues to impact the second half of fiscal year 2014.", "Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance for the quarter, and I'm enthusiastic about our continued growth, not only in our consulting and service areas, but with the new opportunities Exchange Solutions is providing us.", "Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate him, on being named one of the 2013 Outstanding Director Award recipients by the Washington Business Journal and the National Association of Corporate Directors, for his work with MAXIMUS.", "We know first hand of John's leadership, excellence, through his many years of leading Towers Watson as Chairman and CEO. This is an honor well deserved. Congratulations, John.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Roger. Finally, this quarter also marks the end of our third year of integration. It's quite amazing to look back and see the accomplishments of the leadership teams, and all of our associates, that work so hard to achieve our goals.", "We recognize this milestone did not come without sacrifices by our associates and their families. However, the overall client experience has been seamless, and we surpassed our own expectations. Now, we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio of (Roger Bank).", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just on the free cash, it looked very strong in the second quarter, better than we expected. Any kind of update on how you're looking into free cash flow for the fiscal '13?", "Roger Millay", "I guess, I'd say to that that as we said, results were strong, were normalized. And so the results are supportive of the guidance that we had given for the year, which we expected stronger free cash for the full fiscal year, nothing more specific than that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then I'm sorry if I missed it, could you breakout how much did it benefit to, was it a point of organic growth from the normalization of ERP?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, that' correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Gubins of Bank of America.", "Sarah Gubins - Bank of America", "It's nice to see the health and Benefits segment picking up, and you talked about seeing high-single digit growth. Do you think there's any chance that it could accelerate past that as companies are considering their healthcare options under the new legislation?", "John Haley", "I think that's possible, Sarah. If we look back over the last several years though, we've been at about the high-single digits or sometimes the low-double digits, right after some legislative activity. And so I would expect the high-single digits, is probably our best estimate to that, could it go into the low-double digits, yes, perhaps.", "Sarah Gubins - Bank of America", "The opportunity with Fidelity is there any way to size the potential for that opportunity. I know it doesn't really kick in at least for another six months or so?", "John Haley", "No, we don't really have a sizing on that. As I said, we're very excited about having this kind of alliance with Fidelity because we do think there is a very good cultural fit and we think we can go-to-market with this alliance in a very good way. Somewhere to the way indeed that Extend Health and Towers Watson were able to go-to-market before we formally got together. So we're very excited about that. As we think it will open up some opportunities with some very large clients there, but we have no projections at all of what that might be.", "Sarah Gubins - Bank of America", "And then last question, I'm not used to hearing EMEA led growth in areas like Talent and Rewards, so that was encouraging. Was that more of a catch-up, and does it last for a few more quarters or was it a catch-up in the quarter-end and then things should slow down relatively rapidly?", "John Haley", "As I said during the commentary, I think we were a little surprised normally during this kind of an economy as a backdrop, particularly in EMEA. We might have expected somewhat different results. But there were specific things that maybe drove each of them. I went through that list.", "I would mention that a very big one for us though is the executive comp consulting. And if you look at it in EMEA, there is a lot of pressure both from regulators, from public bodies, and just public sentiment, causing people to look at executive compensation plans; the way they're structured, the way they operate, and that drove a big increase in revenue in our executive comp consulting.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "So just to maybe jump a little bit ahead here, but just wanted to see what the cadence at this point is looking like as we start thinking about fiscal '14, almost being through fiscal '13. Is there any puts and takes that you guys can kind of highlight in terms of what the comfort levels would be right now as we start seeing sort of round the corner into fiscal 2014?", "Roger Millay", "Well, Julio, I guess you have the right to look forward, so fine question. And we don't have good guidance beyond this year. I think we've talked on and off about the unpredictable environment. So I don't think we want to look much beyond this year. And I think we talked about the things we're excited about that go beyond the end of fiscal year '13, and that is some of the growth initiatives that we have underway and the strength for the company, but no specific numbers for you at this point.", "Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs", "And just in terms of the cadence in Europe for the rest of fiscal '13. If you start thinking about be in Benefits versus Risk, and Talent and Rewards, and Exchange. When you think about the next couple of quarters for fiscal '13, where are, I guess, the biggest sources of drags in terms to the European exposure right now?", "Roger Millay", "The biggest sources of drag, I mean if you maybe just walk through some of the performance in EMEA, John talked about, telling the Rewards and executive compensation. And then we talked about in the Benefits segment that both retirement and particularly TAS have had some good results recently.", "So I think really the biggest source of drag that we see right now is in the insurance related businesses, particularly risk consulting, which has seen definitely a slowdown in project activity. So I think right now that's the biggest one.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer of SunTrust.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "I don't know if you gave a specific enrollment number or growth number. I heard you say really kind of 3x previous years. What was the rate of growth and enrollments in the exchange business?", "Roger Millay", "I just said the numbers that I think we're going to focus on giving our total active members numbers. And as I think John said in his script, we did achieve our goal of exceeding 350,000, which implies a very robust level of enrollments for this period. And we don't have a specific number on that for you though.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "Could you even a bracket arrange order of magnitude, and if you don't have it in front of you, that's fine, we can get back to it. And I wanted to ask you about cash flow as well. What kind of change, does that imply your new outlook for the full year's free cash flow?", "John Haley", "As I said early, we have not given guidance other than the expectation that we expect free cash to be stronger this year than it was last year. Certainly, we're on track for that. And with receivables normalizing, I think now and I alluded to this in my remarks that, we should be back now to a more normal pattern, where with the business strong as we finish a calendar year, and then in March quarter with a lot of the seasonal activity that goes on, free cash strengthens in the third and fourth quarters. So I think we're back to that more normal pattern that the business has.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "And my last question relates to the exchange business as well. You signed up a partnership now with Fidelity, and that sounds interesting, you're extending the business beyond just retirees as well. Do you have initiatives in place to spread out enrollments in periods other than the heavy fourth quarter. And if so what kind of leverage can you pull to facilitate that?", "John Haley", "So we actually have some off-cycle enrollments that we do right now in the retiree Medicare market. But frankly, what we can do is, it's going to be relatively limited. We think this is going to be a business that is just going to have some real seasonality to it. And even when we move into the active market, well, it's not impossible. You could have plans that would be on different plan years or something like that. The fact of the matter is we think plans are going to be basically calendar year plans.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "You have initiatives to develop a more robust partnership, in kind of channel distribution? In other words, is this Fidelity announcement kind of the first of what could be more?", "Roger Millay", "Just a reminder that we do have an active program, marketing to municipalities that do typically have mid-year, fiscal year, so that offsets a little bit of the seasonality and that's an active marketing program.", "John Haley", "And that's probably more important in the retiree market of the Medicare market than in the active. So I think we'll look at other potential partnerships. But for right now, we're pretty excited about what we have with Fidelity. And as I said we're the largest of such exchange. We like that position. We think Fidelity is going to help us to build on that position. And so we're pretty excited about our prospects going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair.", "Matt Hill - William Blair", "This is Matt Hill in for Tim McHugh. I had a question, on the OneExchange product. I think you made the comment that you didn't expect too much incremental investment going forward in that? So I'm just wondering the set up of that, how much investment was involved? And then, do you think during a more active enrollment period, are we going to see more temporary help coming into facilitate that?", "John Haley", "I think when we were saying that we didn't expect that there was a lot of investment, what we meant was that OneExchange is really built on the same patented technology as the retiree exchange that we have. The underlying technology that we used for that was originally designed for part-time in contract workers, and it's proven to be scalable. So we don't plan on any significant capital investments.", "Now, could we need to bring in a lot of extra people for enrollment as we start adding a lot of people to exchanges around enrollment season? Yes, that would be feature of it. But we were talking about no real capital investment required.", "Matt Hill- William Blair", "And then just a question about the retirement practice, I think you had mentioned that it was a lot of deadline from clients to get the stuff done by the end of the year, involving the long-term payments. Is that something specific to the end of the calendar year for them? Or basically could we expect that maybe at the end of next year kind of breaking up again?", "Roger Millay", "There was a specific provision in the law of that it was a unique opportunity for some arbitrage in the lump sums and the interest rate used to value plans that disappeared December 31.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "My first question, I guess, going back to the Exchange Solutions and the seasonality there. The first half of the year, we had roughly $0.20 EPS drag, your take, I guess. What level of positive should we expect in the second half, presumably nicely north of $0.20? And then the sort of a related question, to what extent should we expect revenue growth to mirror our enrollment growth?", "Roger Millay", "I'm sorry, what was the second half of that?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "Enrollment growth.", "John Haley", "Yes. Well, Ashwin, I don't have at my fingertips, kind of, how our guidance for Exchange Solutions turns into EPS for the second half for the year. Certainly, I think you can see from our guidance for the third quarter and the revenue numbers are, I think around double what they were in the first half of the year. And then the NOI margin instead of being at an NOI loss, we're talking an NOI margin for the third quarter of the low 40% range.", "So the contribution is quite large, just really haven't dropped that down specifically to contribution to EPS, but I think probably that's pretty easy to calculate. And we can talk about it offline, if you want. But I think we've got the numbers out there that you need to calculate.", "And so I think as we've discussed, as you think about how that business runs. The run rate of revenues for the third quarter should be pretty close to the run rate of revenues for the fourth quarter, so the dynamics don't change all that much. It's really first half versus second half.", "I think certainly the enrollment growth and annual enrollments is the main driver of growth for the business. So the participant levels drive revenues, and there will be a close correlation over time. It certainly won't, I'm sure there will be puts and takes, but it won't be exact but there will a close correlation overtime.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "With regards to, I guess, the balance sheet, in the past when you guys have made acquisitions, you have a tendency to pay down any associated term loans and debt associated with the acquisitions as soon as you can. Should we expect a similar pattern here as you kind of head into the healthiest part of your cash flow generation cycle?", "Roger Millay", "Well I think John, may also want to comment, Ashwin, on kind of outlook for growth and things he is thinking about, but in terms of the way we're thinking about the balance sheet, if you look at the levels. And I think we've talked about this around the time that we did the Extend Health acquisition, the level of a bad book debt of about one times EBITDA, which we were totally there. Probably I think we were at 0.7 or 0.8 times EBITDA when we initially did Extend Health.", "That puts us at say two to three times, debt-to-EBITDA from a rating agency, kind of a equivalent leverage point of view. That's a level that we're comfortable with, but going forward really, the activity depends on growth opportunities that we have and other decisions that we make relative to those growth opportunities about managing the balance sheet. But the levels we're at we're comfortable with.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "Just to clarify, you will not necessarily be paying down the debt?", "Roger Millay", "What we had said, just going back to when we did Extend Health, we had talked about focusing in the first six months of the calendar year on debt pay down. And I think that's what we did. So going forward we're not necessarily saying that that's the primary focus, right now. As I said in my remarks, we did start buying stock back again in this past quarter, in the December quarter. So I think nothing more than really were in a range of debt-to-EBITDA that we're comfortable with.", "John Haley", "I was just going to say, I thought Roger summarized it pretty well. I think we feel like we're in a good position. We feel like we have options and I think which way we're going to go is going probably going to be determined by what different opportunities are there.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi", "I guess, last question in on tax rate. Roger, in your comments you had some indication that forward tax rates could continue to head down, is that a target you're looking at?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, and thanks for that question, because I think this is an area of our integration success that people don't highlight quite as much, because it doesn't get technical. But we have started to see that the consolidation activity that we've been engaged in the past three years around the world, it's a great efforts by a lot of folks in this area. If you go back I think about a year ago, we were talking about tax rate of 37% to 38%.", "At one point maybe even as we entered this fiscal year, we drop that down to 36% to 37%. From what we see right now, we're comfortable saying that 35% to 36% range is something that is our steady state. And we continue to work to gradually bring that down. I think we said that in the beginning of integration, we thought we could gradually bring it down. It's taken a lot of work, but we're now on our way I think.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Volshteyn of JPMorgan.", "Jeff Volshteyn - JPMorgan", "Could you remind us the competitive landscape in the exchange offerings from some of your larger and smaller competitors and then both in active and retiree markets?", "John Haley", "So if we look at our key competitors there is, Aon Hewitt is probably our largest competitor. Now, they offer a fully-insured group-based, what they call a, corporate-private exchange solution. They announced it early actually, even before some of the details of ACA were finalized. So it got a lot of attention for that.", "They do have three clients, Sears and Darden and one undisclosed. So there is a Mercer, they've recently announced a relationship for Benefitfocus to provide an offering in the active and non-Medicare exchange space and that's going to be at Medicare marketplace. They also announced recently that they're going to be partnering with Connections to offer an Exchange Solutions for the Medicare eligible populations.", "ACS Buck has recently announced a relationship with CHOICE Administrators Exchange Solutions to provide an offering in the active non-Medicare exchange space. ACS Buck has been working with Connections Inc. for sometime to offer an Exchange Solutions for Medicare eligible population. So that's the same one that Mercer's is going to be partnering with.", "Bloom Health offers a single-carrier, multi-product exchange usually choosing one-carrier partner per market to under-write the small group coverage. Last year, WellPoint, Health Care Services Corporation, and BlueCross BlueShield of Michigan purchased majority stake in Bloom. And Bloom usually partners with the Blues, although they have partnered with the non-BCBS carriers in certain markets.", "And then finally there would be Liaison, which offers a single-carrier, multi-product exchange, usually choosing one-carrier partner per market to under-write small group coverage. Liaison works primarily with regional and national carriers. So those are the five that we would see our key competitors there.", "Jeff Volshteyn - JPMorgan", "And so when you look at your sort of differences between your offering and others, is that your distribution channel, for that your partnerships, help us understand the competitive advantage here?", "John Haley", "So I think there is a couple of things. One is, as I mentioned we've been by far the most successful in the retiree Medicare market. We have a very large share of that market. And the reason we have the large share is that we have a reputation for delivering in a high quality environment. We have technology, which was built from the beginning to be scalable, almost everything is done electronically and so we have this terrific base that we're building off, where we are clearly the leader.", "With our OneExchange product, what we're doing is we're taking that service that we've offered in the retiree medical market and we're extending it to early retirees, to the active market, and we're doing it in a way where the Exchange Solutions folks, as I mentioned who have partnered with a multidisciplinary group throughout Towers Watson. So we've gotten the thinking of our experts in healthcare design and in communications to bring solutions to the market.", "So unlike some others, for example, with the active exchanges, they offer only fully-insured solutions. What we've done is to develop a self-insured solution also. And we and the healthcare economist, I think out there would tell you that, that's the only way to really drive savings in the market. So some of the things we would mention is that; a, we did wait till after the election to make the most of the what the details would be under the Affordable Care Act, so our solutions had been designed with knowledge of what the rules and requirements would be.", "We think we have something that is taking advantage of market forces and good plan designed to drive down cost. We also think we have things that are designed so that you're not going down a blind alley, so we have our design done with the excise tax in 2018 in mind. So we think we offer a solution that is unlike any other in the market.", "Jeff Volshteyn - JPMorgan", "Roger, if I could ask two clarification questions. What are your foreign exchange assumptions for the third quarter?", "Roger Millay", "We have the overall FX assumption for the year that we gave you, the $1.60, the $1.30 and that reflects both the actual for the first half of the year. And then we've given you a projection for the second half. You have to back into the numbers, but I don't think our third quarter is all that far off from the $1.60 or $1.30, but we haven't given you specific numbers for that.", "Jeff Volshteyn - JPMorgan", "And then is there an update to the amount that you'll be contributing to your own pension plan this year?", "Roger Millay", "Not an update. We're still executing against the plans that we talked about, which continue throughout the year. Although, the heaviest cash contributions and payments were in the first half of the year. So that will be a little bit lighter in the second half but still on the same plan.", "Jeff Volshteyn - JPMorgan", "So still, I think it was about $90 million.", "Roger Millay", "It was $90 million higher, I think. The total was like $116 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird.", "Mark Marcon - R.W. Baird", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the dynamics around the big lump sum transactions on the retirement side. And to what extent those end up impacting just the recurring business, number one? Number two, while there is December 31 rationale for doing everything prior to the end of the calendar year, given that tensions continue to increase in terms of visibility and there is a source of pain for client, can you talk about just the additional types of consulting that you're doing there?", "John Haley", "Just as an intro, when you think about de-risking, it really has a lot of different facets, and a lot of that activity has been going on for years. And general de-risking has increased our revenues in some ways and it's decreased it in others.", "For example, when you freeze a pension plan, it generates actuarial administration, communication revenues. Following the freeze, there is maybe less consulting on plan design in regulatory compliance. However, if you look at the actuarial, the administration, the investment services needed by the plan that remains largely the same.", "(technical difficulty) bulk lump sum projects, it's the same kind of things there. The interesting thing about the bulk lump sums is the people who are being paid off and there pension liabilities extinguished, they are the people who are the near-term recipients of Benefits.", "So when I pay off the people who are the current retirees, when I give them lump sums and get rid of their pension liabilities, I haven't shortened the life of the pension plan by any degree at all, because the actives are still running out there for decades and the plan is running on.", "Now, with a larger group of the population gone, there maybe less of activity on some plan design projects for those individuals, but again, all of the actuarial, administrative investment work that needs to be done on the plan it continues really on the same time scale as it would have before. So I think that's for the first of the question.", "On the second part, I guess, I would say that pension plans, they do have a lot of prominence as you mentioned, and it's important to the organization. I actually think we'll continue to see activity in, first of all just de-risking, generally will continue to be activity. But specifically in terms of bulk sump sums, I expect to see people continuing to look at them.", "Even though the particular arbitrage activity that was available disappeared December 31, there were still be good reasons for pension plans to look to payoff individuals and get rid of the liabilities. I mean one simple reason for that is, you look PBGC premiums are supposed to go up in the U.S. and as PBGC premiums go up, if people can payoff the retirees and get out of them, then they'll better off.", "Mark Marcon - R.W. Baird", "And then with regards to the healthcare practice, wouldn't there be a rationale for assuming that the consulting will pick up. There was obviously in the fourth quarter a lot of uncertainty around the election, and whether or not it would make sense to do any sort of consulting around it given the uncertainty of the election? But now that we have clarity and there's deadlines, wouldn't we expect there to be some additional work that would be done, particularly since some of the regulatory agencies just recently ended up coming out with their interpretations of legislation?", "John Haley", "So if you look at the high-single digits, which is what we had talked about, that is actually a pick up from what the healthcare growth rate has been in recent quarters. And in response to an earlier question, I think it was from Sarah, she said that I thought that is it possible that that could be in the low-double digits. I think it's possible. I just think we haven't seen that yet. And so we think that high-single digits, is probably a prudent number for guidance.", "Mark Marcon - R.W. Baird", "And then can you talk a little bit just more about OneExchange and also clients with Fidelity, just in terms of how the business model would be different than the Extend Health or if it's similar?", "John Haley", "So I think the great thing about OneExchange is that it really offers one integrated system for employers to handle all of their healthcare. So it takes this existing platform that we used for retirees. And it extends that same platform. And we think this is one of the beauties of the system that Extend had, and it forms the basis of Exchange Solutions, is that it's a system that was built to handle all of the difficult healthcare, all the different populations and it's easily scalable.", "So we don't require any extra investment and we can extend that to everybody. But the OneExchange really just gives it, you go to one place and you can handle all your different healthcare populations through the same platform.", "Mark Marcon - R.W. Baird", "The way that you would be paid would be the same way?", "John Haley", "It's our intention to use payments from the health plans to fund OneExchange. Now, this is subject to change based on how payment structures and associated regulations emerging in non-Medicare markets. So we have a plan now, but we're going to look and see how that market develops.", "Mark Marcon - R.W. Baird", "And then you were going on to Fidelity?", "John Haley", "Yes, then I was going on to Fidelity. By the way, the other thing I'd just say quickly before I leave OneExchange. The other great thing about it is we have it tied in with our healthcare consulting capability. And so that means that I think we do have some great plan designs that we're able to offer to the partners.", "So specifically what is Extend Health going to do with Fidelity Investments? We're going to work them into; a, provide retirees with the access to resources and support to get quality coverage at a price that the retirees can afford. We're going to assist plan sponsors during this transition as they communicate changes and help retirees, select a private insurance option.", "And then finally, where Fidelity has what they call their Plan for Life workplace guidance experience and we're going to enhance that by giving them access to the Extend Health exchange.", "The business arrangement, we would classify this really as a channel partner arrangement. And the channel partner arrangement is very familiar to us because when Extend was a private company, Towers Watson was one of their channel partners. We found this type of strategic alliance a benefit that both Exchange Solutions and channel partner and it really works quite effectively. Both sides were quite pleased with the way that worked in the past and we expect it's going to bring benefits to both us and Fidelity.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no additional questions in queue.", "John Haley", "Well, we'll close then. So thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We look forward to reviewing our third quarter results with you in May.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

My name is Sheena, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the call over to Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations at Towers Watson. Please proceed, ma'am.", "Aida Sukys", "Thank you, Sheena. Good morning. Welcome to the Towers Watson earnings call. I'm here today with John Haley, Towers Watson's Chief Executive Officer; and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please refer to our website for this morning's press release. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay via telephone for the next 2 weeks by dialing (617) 801-6888, confirmation number 65966102.

For a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release and the accompanying financial tables we posted this morning.", "After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions.", "Now I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John J. Haley", "Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll review our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "Reported revenues for the quarter were $941 million, an increase of 4% over prior year reported revenues and up 2% on an organic basis. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5.5%. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures.", "Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $191 million or 20.3% of revenues. The prior year adjusted EBITDA was $180 million or 19.9% of revenues.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.34, up 41%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.60, up 15%.", "We're very pleased with the overall results this quarter. All segments either met or exceeded revenue guidance, and all regions posted revenue growth. Regulatory changes and economic uncertainty are continuing to fuel growth in our businesses, while at the same time that economic uncertainty continues to affect some of our other businesses dependent on discretionary spend.", "It's a challenging time to manage the business as economic uncertainty and regulatory changes are causing the same lines of business to trend very differently in different parts of the world. I'd like to commend our global and local leadership for working together in this dynamic environment, and our associates, who are in the marketplace helping us understand how to better deliver value to our clients. Today's global environment tests our management disciplines daily, but it also challenges us to be more innovative by continually focusing on our clients' evolving needs.", "It's been almost a year since we acquired Extend Health, and we could not be more pleased with the results. Not only did it bring us the market-leading retiree exchange, but it's been a catalyst to the development of OneExchange.", "As we previously noted, there are 3 pillars in our growth strategy: acquisition, innovation and market penetration. The acquisition of Extend Health spans all 3 pillars of that strategy. It's driving innovation by leveraging our leading health care consultants with the powerful health and welfare administration platform in our TAS business and the Medicare exchange technology developed by Extend Health in the launch of OneExchange. We believe that this multidisciplinary approach to the market and unique offering will lead to deeper market penetration.", "Now let's look at the performance of each of our segments. On an organic basis, Benefits grew 1.5%. Risk and Financial Services grew 4%, and Talent and Rewards declined 4%. On a pro forma basis, Exchange Solutions grew 75%.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $523 million. Benefits segment revenues were up 1.5% on a constant currency basis due to increased project work across all lines of business and low single-digit growth in both the Americas and EMEA.", "Retirement revenues increased by 1% on a constant currency basis, with flat to modest growth in both the Americas and EMEA regions.", "The Americas continues to see some bulk lump sum project work, but as we mentioned in our call last quarter, the volume will not be as significant in the second half of the fiscal year as we experienced in the first half.", "Technology and Administration Solutions revenues increased by 7% on a constant currency basis due to new client work in each of the regions. In the Americas, Health and Group Benefits constant currency revenues increased by 5% on a comparable of 14% growth in the third quarter of FY '12. The pipeline continues to look solid. Going forward, the Benefits segment should continue to show modest growth in all 3 lines of business.", "Now let me turn to Risk and Financial Services. For the quarter, the Risk and Financial Services segment had revenues of $225 million. Revenues were up 4% on a constant currency basis, led by growth in the Americas and EMEA. Risk consulting and software revenue declined by 3% on a constant currency basis.", "The Americas region revenues were flat. EMEA and Asia Pacific revenues decreased due to client demand. Globally, clients continue to be cautious with discretionary spending.", "Brokerage revenues grew by 12% on a constant currency basis. The January 1 renewals were strong, and we had some good new wins. Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains strong.", "Investment had 13% constant currency revenue growth, led by EMEA. All regions experienced growth this quarter. EMEA continued to post double-digit constant currency revenue increases due to project work and performance fees. We continue to feel confident in the investment pipeline.", "Overall, we expect Risk and Financial Services to perform as guided with modest growth.", "Now let's move on to Talent and Rewards. For the quarter, the Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $125 million, with revenues down 4% on a constant currency basis. The decline was driven by Data, Surveys and Technology, and the Rewards, Talent and Communication line of business.", "In Data, Surveys and Technology, we experienced earlier delivery of surveys this year, which increased our first half revenues but is now resulting in year-over-year declines. We're also seeing a softer spend environment, which particularly impacted Rewards, Talent and Communication in North America. As the challenging environment continues, we continue to market aggressively and leverage our resources effectively.", "Executive Compensation revenues had 2% constant currency revenue growth. Executive Compensation continues to be driven by increased regulation and governance activity in EMEA and by strong demand in Asia Pacific, particularly in China. The second half of the fiscal year is generally seasonally slower for Talent and Rewards.", "Last, I'd like to move to the Exchange Solutions segment. For the quarter, the Exchange Solutions segment had revenues of $31 million, net of deferral revenue required by purchase accounting rules. On a pro forma basis, excluding the $500,000 negative accounting adjustment, revenues grew by 75%.", "As I stated last quarter, we had a record number of enrollments, which accounted for the revenue growth this quarter as policies went into effect on January 1, 2013.", "This quarter marks the end of our formal 3-year integration. We've successfully accomplished a significant milestone, and we did it on time, on budget and most importantly, we achieved our stated merger objectives. Towers Watson has been able to leverage our resources into new markets. We've been able to expand and enhance our global footprint with acquisitions, and we fostered a culture of innovation with a clear and direct focus on our client needs.", "However, this milestone does not signify the end of our commitment to continued process improvements, our disciplined management approach or the spirit of innovation and client focus. We've had a strong third quarter, and we firmly established a framework for long-term continued success.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger F. Millay", "Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone. We had a strong quarter, and as John mentioned earlier, we've reached a couple of key milestones. The third quarter officially marked the end of our formal integration process, and May marks the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of Extend Health. I've been very impressed with the strong collaboration among our colleagues during our 3-year integration period. This was difficult work, and it's a real accomplishment to be finished on time and to have met our financial objectives.", "I'm also very pleased with how well Extend Health has aligned with the Towers Watson organization. The Extend Health team brought strong capabilities to Towers Watson, both personally and in the legacy Extend Health business model, which we've quickly been able to leverage in the collaborative effort with the Health and Group Benefits team, the Technology and Administration Solutions team and the Client Development Group to drive the build-out of OneExchange and continued strong growth.", "As John noted, our overall constant currency revenue growth came in about as expected this quarter, but our reported revenues grew at a lower rate. In the March quarter, the decline in foreign currency, particularly the pound sterling, had a negative impact of approximately $10 million in our revenue guidance, as well as year-over-year reported revenue comparisons. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition accounting and transaction and integration costs.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had a 35% NOI margin, and Risk and Financial Services had a 29% NOI margin. As a reminder, this is a seasonally strong quarter for both Benefits and Risk and Financial Services. Talent and Rewards had an 11% NOI margin in what is a seasonally softer quarter for them. Exchange Solutions had a 48% NOI margin.", "Net income attributable to controlling interests for the quarter was $95 million. Adjusted net income was $114 million.", "This quarter, we had $12 million of transaction and integration costs. We finalized all transaction and integration costs and ended up with our guidance -- within our guidance range of $30 million to $35 million for the fiscal year at $31 million.", "As we mentioned on the last earnings call, the worldwide finance and human resource ERP system deployment was completed as of February 1. Beginning April 1, we've been operating in a business-as-usual mode, which means we'll continue to look at system and process efficiencies in the normal course of managing our business processes.", "The tax rate for the quarter was 31%. The forecasted rate was a range of 35% to 36%. There were a couple of nonrecurring events that decreased the tax rate in the third quarter. The most significant event was the settlement of a tax examination, which positively impacted our adjusted diluted EPS by $0.06.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. At March 31, we had $423 million in cash available for our use. During the quarter, we generated $250 million of free cash, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $220 million. As of March 31, 2012, free cash flow was $67 million.", "The year-over-year increase was mainly a result of the collection of client receivables and the wind-down of the IT and ERP system projects, resulting in lower fixed asset costs. We expect to continue to see strong free cash flow as we complete fiscal year '13.", "We had $135 million of borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter, down $140 million from $275 million last quarter. During this quarter, we repurchased approximately 176,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $10 million.", "Now let's review our guidance for fiscal year 2013.", "Overall, we expect revenue to be around $3.6 billion. We took away the high end of our previous revenue range given the decline of the pound over the past few months. Our expected constant currency growth rate remains intact. We're increasing our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share to be within the range of $5.44 to $5.49 from our last forecast of $5.28 to $5.38. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be around 19%.", "For the fourth quarter, our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of USD 1.51 to the British pound and an average exchange rate of USD 1.30 to the euro. We expect the fiscal year '13 income tax rate to be around 33%, which is a bit lower than our previously expected level for the year given the nonrecurring benefits we've realized the past couple of quarters.", "We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 71 million. We expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share. However, we anticipate this difference to narrow somewhat now that the formal integration and transition period is complete. There will longer be an adjustment for transaction and integration expense or merger-related stock-based compensation. We'll continue to adjust for amortization of merger accounting intangibles.", "Now we'll review our fiscal year guidance for the segments. We expect constant currency revenue growth in the Benefits segment to be around 4% for the fiscal year. The NOI margin for Benefits is expected to be in the low to mid-30% range.", "Next, in the Risk and Financial Services segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 3% for the fiscal year. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low to mid-20% range.", "In the Talent and Rewards segment, we expect constant currency revenue to be roughly flat for the year. We expect the NOI margin to be in the high teens range.", "Lastly, in the Exchange Solutions segment, we expect pro forma revenue growth of around 35% for the fiscal year, which is net of about $12 million of deferred revenue write-off required by GAAP purchase accounting rules. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low double-digit range, which includes the impact of the deferred revenue write-off.", "Overall, I'm pleased with our performance for the quarter. The foundation of our business is strong. While the global economy continues to be somewhat challenging and some of our businesses are benefiting from the changing dynamics, while others are finding more challenges, our long-term outlook is very strong.", "Now I'll turn it back to John.", "John J. Haley", "Okay, yes. Thanks, Roger. Now we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Volshteyn, JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Looking at the expense line items, they came in a little bit lighter than we expected. Can you just talk about some of the perhaps efficiencies that are in there? And did they come in within your expectations on the expense lines?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, I'd say broadly, one, you should remember that FX is in there, and that's probably a little bit of a contributor. I mean, broadly, as we've been talking about, I think, since last summer, we did take a disciplined outlook for fiscal year '13 in expenses, and I think the results show that we have had good discipline and good expense control. In terms of probably the biggest thing that comes to mind that probably has happened as you look at line items in the P&L is some of the changes with respect to the IT projects completing and some rationalization based on some of the outsourcing that was done previously in one of the legacy companies going away. But I think, in general, it's a broad impact and again, underlying integration and IT consolidation related.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And how should we think about the tax rate, let's say, for 2014?", "Roger F. Millay", "I think we haven't really changed our view. I think we talked about it last quarter that this 35% to 36% range seemed like a reasonable ongoing level. There are, as you know, quarter-to-quarter one-off items that happen in taxes that change that. But I think for the moment, that's our longer-term outlook or medium-term outlook, let's call it. But also with the anticipation that gradually, we hope to realize some efficiencies that you see come in and push the rate down a little bit over a kind of a multi-year horizon.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. If I could squeeze in one more. There's, I think, a negative stock compensation item in the quarter. Was that a reversal of something?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, it was an adjustment that was related to the finalization of some of the legacy programs that actually relates to the assumption you make on people who end up leaving before the stock program concludes. So it was really a finalization of some accounting that we had done on stock compensation.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tim McHugh, William Blair & Company.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on that last one, I guess, just to be clear. Was that related to the Towers parent acquisition or just normal ongoing?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, it was related to, again, some of those legacy merger programs, yes.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "So you excluded that anyway?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, it is excluded, yes.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. All right. And then just on the Talent and Rewards and, I guess, specifically the data side, obviously, the macro environment is a little tough in Europe, and you talked about some of the timing issues throughout the year. So it's understandable why it's down, I guess. But just if we look at the competitive environment and maybe kind of the client preferences, is there anything happening in the marketplace that is more structural or changes your view of how that business can grow going forward?", "John J. Haley", "No, I don't think so. Talent and Rewards is a business that is, as we've talked about before, is the most economically sensitive. And so we do expect some volatility -- more volatility there than in any of the other ones. There is an element of sort of discretionary spend that accompanies a lot of the services we have there. But our overall view of Talent and Rewards that over the course of a whole business cycle, that's probably going to generate a higher revenue growth than, say, the other 2 large segments, we still continue to subscribe to that.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And in the exchange business, I know it's small, but it looks like you're looking for sequential growth, which I think -- you haven't owned it for a long time, but I think that's a little abnormal. I usually thought Q4 was the -- calendar Q4 was the big sequential uptick. Are you seeing good -- is that a sign of good off-season kind of enrollment trends? And I guess, a follow-up is, are you at a point yet where you have any visibility towards what enrollment growth might look like in the fall in terms of client additions?", "John J. Haley", "Well, Roger, you may want to comment a little more on how things fall in the quarters. But, frankly, it's actually the third quarter that's usually seasonally the most strongest. Roger, you want to...", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, I mean, there is some off-cycle activity. So I think you're noting there, Tim, that maybe the range is a little bit higher than where we came in for the third quarter. But as John said, it's primarily, again, the enrollment season is in the fall. But again, there is some off-cycle activity, which contributes as you go through the year.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Do you have any visibility yet towards this upcoming fall in terms of the client additions? And, I guess, when would you start to have better visibility?", "John J. Haley", "We don't have any visibility right now. I mean, we're out in the marketplace talking to companies that are looking to maybe go for 2014. But those decisions won't be made for a few more months.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Ginocchio, Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "John, 2 questions for you. First, are you worried as we get into the back half of the year that maybe the implementation of health care reform could distract HR departments and maybe cause some discretionary projects to be delayed? And then second, how comfortable are you with your current portfolio of businesses? And are you looking to rationalize that portfolio at all?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. So I think when we look at the impact of health care reform, I think there's always -- it's unlikely that a lot of change around health care reform is going to spill over into, say, Talent and Rewards or even into Retirement or something like that. If people are doing some things around health care reform, it could affect other consulting projects that we might have done in the health care arena specifically. Overall, we're pretty pleased with the diversification we have really across all potential possibilities in the health care reform area. So for -- to the extent companies continue in the similar fashion to providing health care, we'll continue to provide them with our health care consulting services. To the extent they decide to move into an exchange area, we're all set to take care of that, too. So we like the service offerings we have there. We think it meets all of our potential client needs. And we think it provides us as a business good diversification. With regard to our overall portfolio of services, when we set out our growth strategy, we said that one of the things we would look at is -- increasing market penetration was one of our growth pillars, innovation was another one of our growth pillars, and M&A activity was another one of our growth pillars. And we're always looking at potential acquisitions out there, and we always are in the market for potentially considering them. I don't think that we're going to turn out to be doing an extraordinary number of acquisitions. I think we did Extend Health last year and we'll probably be doing ones of that size maybe every few years.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I guess, John, I was more interested if you're thinking about any divestitures?", "John J. Haley", "Well, I mean, when you look at mergers and acquisitions, you consider the whole portfolio. But we're focused right now on some -- on thinking about how we can really build the business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sara Gubins, Bank of America.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Within Exchange Solutions, could you talk about how you would expect costs to ramp over the next year or so? There are a lot of initiatives which sound very exciting but are kind of long term in nature. And I'm wondering if that might have a negative impact on as we think about fiscal '14 pro forma margins?", "Roger F. Millay", "I think, Sara, that one, given the growth -- potential growth profile of that business, as we've been emphasizing, I think, over the past year, there is some unpredictability as to how the margins will behave kind of quarter-to-quarter and even year-over-year. And as we've noted, not only the seasonality effect between the first half of the year given the seasonal ramp-ups, but also the impact that, again, that has from one fiscal year to the next. So I think in the retiree part of the business, it greatly depends on what we get in the new business pipeline and what the enrollment demand is for the fall, similar to fiscal year '13. I think for the other -- the build in OneExchange, as we've said, the work that's going on right now is incorporated into our guidance. As we look into next year, we just don't expect any significant impact on the margins of the company. Although depending on the amount of activity that we get, again, you could see some costs increase similar to what we see in the TAS business as we get new clients today or historically, where there is some cost investment and some deferral of those costs as we build out the systems for new clients. So as the year goes on and we understand the actual pipeline of activity, we'll be giving more specifics and more detail on what we expect there.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Second, within Risk and Financial Services, in the fourth quarter, you're looking for 1% to 3% constant currency revenue growth, could you give a little bit more color on that given that it's the easiest comparison of the year?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, I'll just comment first, I suppose, from how we put the view together, and John may want to add to that. But I think probably, in general, in terms of the trends of the underlying lines of business, we don't see anything right now much different than the trends that we saw in the third quarter, which is good performance out of investment and Brokerage with continued growth. And a more challenging environment in Risk Consulting, where, as we've noted, there is discretionary spend pressure, which we've particularly seen in EMEA and Asia Pacific. So I think again, similar dynamics with similar kind of upsides and risks.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just last question, you had pretty clearly outlined in the last quarter that the lump sum work in the Retirement business wouldn't recur at the same levels. But I'm wondering if there's any reason to think that as you look out over the course of calendar 2013, if that might pick up perhaps in the second half of the calendar year?", "John J. Haley", "So I think -- there was a special reason why we had the -- we had a lot of the work done on lump sums in the last quarter. There was, in fact, as we've mentioned before, a bit of an arbitrage opportunity that occurred then. And we expected that this year, the amount of the bulk lump sum work would be substantially down. I think we still see that. We're not saying that it will go away at all completely, but we don't see it at quite the level we had last year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tobey Sommer, SunTrust.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could give us some color of what this current quarter's enrollment looked like in the Exchange Solutions business on the municipal and state side with their fiscal year starting in July.", "Roger F. Millay", "So you're asking, Tobey, sorry, that the off-cycle enrollments for the March quarter itself?", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "No, for the June quarter, the quarter we're in. I assume that anybody you've sold, you're in the process of enrolling now.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, I mean, again, the low -- I mean, I don't have any numbers for you. There is a relatively low level of activity in the interim quarters at this point, and we would hope longer-term to move away from the extreme seasonality that we have right now. But it's nowhere near the magnitude that we experience in the fall.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Roger, the cash flow has improved this year, partially attributable, I guess, to the integration winding down and good margins. What do you think about cash deployment now in the balance sheet? Because it looks like the net cash balance is set to rise unless you spend it. Any updated thoughts on that will be helpful.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, I think, no updated specifics, and what we've generally said about emphasizing flexibility to do acquisitions and then historically when we view capacity to deploy more free cash, leaning to share repurchase, and I know we still have about $120 million available in the share repurchase authority that we have from the board from last year. I think you know well, Tobey, that coming out of integration, the free cash generation is back to levels that we would expect. And it was very heartening to see in the balance sheet this quarter DSO back to more historic levels. And those are processes, as I noted in my remarks, that we'll continue to work on, although certainly there isn't going to be upside to move them to the same degree that we moved them over the past 6 to 9 months.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum, Stifel.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I just want to go back to an earlier question. Just on the Data, Surveys and Technology. John, was the kind of likeness this quarter, was it all due to the pull-forward earlier in the year? Or was there anything else going on that makes that a little bit more discretionary and therefore, it was more vulnerable this year -- this quarter?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, so there's a couple of things really, Shlomo. One is that distribution among the quarters, as we mentioned. But you also have to remember that the distribution was somewhat skewed last year. So last year, at this time, we had -- I think it was a 20% increase in DST. And so the comparable is very high.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then in Europe, can you just walk through the different areas of the business and quickly just give us a feel for where you might be feeling -- seeing weakness or strength? And are you getting a sense that we're getting some stabilization over there for your business? Or is it continuing to kind of gradually step down a little?", "John J. Haley", "Okay, I'm sorry, Shlomo, just to be clear, I actually gave you the 20% I think was for RTC. It was 13% last year for DST. But I think the point still stays that it was a very tough comparable as to what we're comparing to. So DST is something that I think for the moment, it's easier to compare it on an annual basis than it is on a quarter-to-quarter basis.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So you're basically saying it\u2019s strong comp -- a tough comp?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. I'm sorry, what was your second question?", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just going through EMEA, where are you seeing pockets of strength or weakness? And are you feeling like we're getting a little bit more stability or is it continuing to deteriorate just at a slower pace?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, I think EMEA, the one area that we -- if we look at RCS, Roger talked about RCS, the Risk Consulting and Software, as discretionary funds being tight really across all of the different regions of the world. But I think we noticed that maybe a little bit more in EMEA than anywhere else. And there are fewer discretionary projects. I think the continual delay in Solvency II has had a tough impact on EMEA. So I think that RCS is something that we see as being relatively weaker in EMEA at the moment than it is in some other areas. We see investment and Retirement and TAS are really all up in EMEA. Exec comp is up a little bit, not as much as it had been. But it really varies a good bit across the specific practices. Talent and Rewards, in general -- I mentioned exec comp as being a little bit up, but Talent and Rewards is really affected by discretionary spending. So it's one that we're a little concerned about the outlook there.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Then just going back to a comment you made earlier, you could do acquisitions the size of Extend Health every few years, are you referring to revenue or are you referring to $430 million price tag?", "John J. Haley", "Well, I think if you think about what we said in our growth strategy, which was that we would like to maybe grow by about an extra 2% or so per year as a result of inorganic growth, then if we did something that was about a 10% of revenues every 4 years or so, that would feel about right. That would get us to about 2.5% average every year. If we're spending one time -- so that's -- our revenues are $3.6 billion, so $360 million. If we were spending around 1x revenue or 1.25x revenue, we'd be somewhere in the neighborhood of what we spent for Extend. So I think that's the kind of thing I was thinking about when I said that.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, Roger, last question, just what do you feel is a normalized annual free cash flow number for the business today as it stands?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, we don't have specific numbers, I suppose. But in terms of an aspiration and a range in which we think it should fall, adjusted -- having free cash flow in the neighborhood of adjusted net income is something that over time that we think we should see.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Tobey Sommer, SunTrust.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask you a question about the hiring environment from competitors. Are you, do you think, a net gainer of talent in the marketplace? Any color you can give about the pace of hiring and where you're focusing your additions will be helpful.", "John J. Haley", "Yes. Okay, so I think overall it's a competitive market for talent that we're in. I think if you were to ask me, I'd say I think we probably are a slight net gainer as a result of all of the different movement that occurs. I think we, a few years ago, we might have been seeing more gains, more relative gains than we see today because I think some of our competitors were having some issues a few years ago that maybe they have a little bit behind them. But I think overall, we feel pretty good about our positioning. We feel pretty good about the value proposition we have, and it's something that seems to be resonating in the marketplace. I mean, I think probably the proof of that is that this is not something that's at the top of our list that we're worried about losing folks to competitors or not being able to attract them.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And then my last question has to do with the deferred revenue adjustment on the Exchange Solutions business. Will the effect of that dissipate over time? How does -- how should we think about the mechanics of modeling that into the future?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, it really has dissipated. So I think we noted in our remarks that it was only $500,000 this past quarter, and that's down from -- well, it's $12 million for the year, so it's down from millions in the first and second quarter. And so it's really -- it's down to virtually nothing, and it does go away totally after the first year. So as you look forward, it's really not much of a factor at all.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Marcon, R. W. Baird.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I have 3 on 3 different areas. First of all, with regards to Exchange Solutions, I recognized the pipeline in terms of what the enrollments are going to be in the coming fall are still unclear at this point, but is there anything that has diminished your enthusiasm around that area? Or would you expect the growth to continue to be quite strong?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, I don't think there's anything at all that has diminished our enthusiasm around Exchange Solutions. Now this was a very good year we had. We grew at an even faster rate than we projected and I'm not saying we'll grow at that rate every year or anything. But I think I can say about the whole management team and the board, we're more enthusiastic about Exchange Solutions today than we were the day we did the deal.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "That's what I thought, but I wasn't sure it was coming across on the call in terms of some of the earlier responses to some of the questions. Because it sounds like from some of your practice managers that within retirees, we could potentially, in terms of that penetration level, that could potentially go up into the 70% to 80% range over the next few years. Is that still a correct assumption?", "John J. Haley", "That's what we would like to see. I mean, I think the -- I'm glad you asked that question because sometimes, you're doing these earnings calls and you respond to the specific detailed question and you don't always communicate some of the sense of enthusiasm that you feel about things as much as you'd like. But I think, look, we're the market leader in the retiree exchange business, and we've been growing that lead this year, and we expect to continue to grow that for a number of years.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. That's what I thought. And then with regards to health care consulting, how are you expecting that to ramp up as we get closer and closer to certain deadlines for the ACA, some of which are right on our doorstep?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, I don't know. I think we've seen the health care consulting itself sort of vary between the mid-single digits up to the low-double digits over the last, in any particular quarter, over the last few years. I think we'll probably continue to see it in that range as to which quarters it's going to be up in the high-single digits or low-double digits as opposed to which one it's in the down, maybe more in the middle. I think it's hard for us to predict the exact incidence of that. But we feel good about saying that the overall result is, we think that the health care consulting is going to be somewhere in the mid-single digits, and that's assuming that there's not really some big change to active exchanges. If there's that, that will general a lot of business because the active exchanges are really something that is a collaboration between our health care consulting, our TAS, our Exchange Solutions and also Talent and Rewards in regard to consulting on communication in change management and the value proposition to retirees. So that's a business the exchange -- to the extent employers move to active exchanges, it generates a lot of work, not just for the health care consulting, but for really a lot of parts of the business.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then finally, on the pension side, there's, obviously, been a lot more press recently in terms of some of the P&I 1000 and the challenges that they're facing with regards to where their assets stand relative to the current present value of the obligations. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking that, that's going to evolve? I know we had the big arbitrage situation last quarter, but what sort of opportunities does that present?", "John J. Haley", "Well, I think -- what we think is that there's going to continue to be some bulk lump sums. We don't expect to see some big sea change in, for example, a lot of plan terminations. Even if interest rates rise, we don't think that would be something that would trigger them. Lots of different reasons why plan sponsors have taken steps to stabilize the funded status through investment strategies that really match the asset returns but changes the liability. So even if interest rates went up, you wouldn't necessarily have the biggest change there. There would be questions about the capacity of the annuity market. You provide attractively priced annuities. That could diminish as interest rates go up. We would also see an issue about supply and demand, so we don't see any big change in that. That would be something that would have a more dramatic impact on the business than almost anything else, and we see very little chance of that occurring. So that suggests we're going to be seeing more of the same kinds of things that we've seen over the last few years. We're going to see employers a little bit concerned about how they have to fund their plan. We're going to be looking to see employers taking steps to try to improve the funding. People looking at things like bulk lump sums and some options like that. But I don't think we're going to see anything that's dramatically different than what we've seen.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So my first question is on the Exchange Solutions business. Can you comment on the non-retiree portion of it? Some nice partnership-type announcements recently. On a multi-year basis that non-retiree portion should still be a pretty good source of incremental growth for certain types of industry at least, right? I'm thinking retail, fast food, that type of industry. Can you comment on that?", "John J. Haley", "Roger may want to jump in here, but let me just say I think we've spent a lot of time on designing the OneExchange solution, and the reason we spent so much time on that and we believe we have really the industry-leading solution here, is because that's potentially a very big sea change in what happens in health care delivery in the United States. So we expect to see that. Now the OneExchange includes the ExtendRetirees, which we're projecting are going to grow at 20-plus percent for several years. Participation in the other parts of it, the ExtendAccess, which connects to the public exchanges, and ExtendActives, that's going to grow a little more slowly. We're going -- it's going to be limited to select employers for January 1, 2014. And we expect that most of our clients are going to study the impacts of moving to an exchange model carefully, and we don't expect to see a tremendous amount of activity in the first year. We expect to see movement to ExtendActive and ExtendAccess in the 2015 enrollment period and possibly even stronger enrollment for the 2016 enrollment season. So we're very excited about this prospect. We love the design and what we have. We think we have some things to offer that nobody else is offering at the moment. But it's not something that we expect to see a lot of enrollment just in the next 6 months or year. Roger, do you want to add anything to that?", "Roger F. Millay", "I think you said it very well, John. I'd just emphasize the enthusiasm, which of course, is illustrated by the amount of activity that we have going on there.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "On that, because you have sort of a multi-year path, what are doing with your sales force and building out the support side of it? Will that be more of a just-in-time kind of a fix to how you deliver the business? Or is that something you build because you kind of believe strongly that they will come?", "John J. Haley", "Well, it's a -- one of the things to keep in mind is that the health care consultants that we have right now that are in there, every health care consultant is being asked by their clients about the pros and cons of moving to exchanges. So the best sales force we have for getting clients to understand the value proposition there is really the existing health care consultants we have, plus our Exchange Solutions folks, who have a particular knowledge base in the retiree area. But the health care consultants are working every day with their clients on the pros and cons of what goes on there.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it. My last question really is given what the equity markets are doing, John, does that affect sort of the nature of the strategic conversations that you have at high levels with buyers of your services?", "John J. Haley", "I'm not sure exactly what you're driving at there, Ashwin. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit?", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Well, equity markets have been quite strong, and I'm just kind of wondering how that affects pension plans. And does that in turn affect the conversations that you might be having with your client base because of that?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, I mean -- I think, look, one of the things that -- 2 things about the equity markets. One, to the extent pension funds are in the equity markets, it's a great thing to see that go up and improve the funding status of the plans, and I think we all feel better when the plans are somewhat better funded. So it's desirable to see that. As I mentioned just a few minutes ago in response to a different question, a lot of plan sponsors have really taken steps to stabilize their funded status through investment strategies that are matching the asset returns with the changes in liabilities. So for sponsors that have done them, the equity markets don't provide quite the boost that they might have seen in the past.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to John Haley for closing remarks.", "John J. Haley", "Okay. Well, thanks very much, everyone, for joining us this morning, and we look forward to reviewing our fourth quarter results with you in August. So long.", "Operator", "Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

A webcast replay of the call, along with a slide presentation to which we'll be referring, can be accessed through our website.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.", "I'll now turn the call over to Dominic.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Welcome, and thank you for joining our quarterly conference call. By now, you've had a chance to read the news release that we put out last night and have a copy of our slides at the ready.", "With me today are Michael Neborak, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Hearn, our Deputy CEO and Head of Willis Global; and Tim Wright, Head of Willis International. Also joining us today for the first time is Todd Jones, who recently took over from Vic Krauze, as CEO of Willis North America.", "As you saw in our recent press release, Todd joined Willis 10 years ago and he and Vic have worked closely together for a number of years, with Todd most recently in the role of President of Willis North America and prior to that, as National Partner for the Northeast. I'm delighted that Todd and Vic will continue their partnership as they work to further strengthen and grow our North American business.", "While I am on the topic of introducing new faces, I'm sure you also saw our release this week, following our Annual Shareholders' Meeting. We have 3 newly-elected board members: Paco Luz\u00f3n, Jaymin Patel and Jeff Ubben. In addition, you will also have seen that on July 8, Jim McCann was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman. These are all highly talented individuals who bring broad expertise in global enterprise, finance, management, teamwork and innovation. I'm sure that their strong leadership and governance experience will help guide our business forward.", "As usual, we will be happy to answer your questions after Mike and I offer our introductory remarks.", "So let me turn to an overview of our results. We continue to make progress this quarter in growing our top line, delivering 6.3% organic growth. We are very happy with that. Importantly, this was the third consecutive quarter of solid organic growth in each of our segments: Willis North America, Willis International and Willis Global.", "Global led the way, with 10.3% growth; with North America and International growing at 5.5% and 2.6%, respectively. My congratulations to Steve, Vic, Todd and Tim and their organizations for the continued progress we are seeing in building strong, sustainable revenue growth.", "Now digging into the numbers of it. Our reported GAAP earnings were $0.59 per diluted share in the current quarter. Importantly, the current quarter had no adjusting items, so our reported and adjusted figures were the same. This compares to adjusted EPS of $0.59 in the year-ago quarter.", "I would point out that this does not really give you the full picture of how we view the underlying improvement in EPS, as there were a few items that we highlighted in our press release, which distorted the year-over-year comparisons. Mike will walk you through those in more detail shortly.", "So let's spend a few minutes looking at each of the businesses in some detail. I'll start with Willis North America. As I mentioned, North America achieved 5.5% organic growth in the quarter. In the year ago quarter, North America organic growth declined. So this is a good result that follows on the back of improving results in recent quarters. Importantly, growth in the quarter was largely driven by new business wins. While rate was generally positive, we estimated that it accounted for around 1.5% of our growth during the quarter.", "North America's growth was well distributed geographically across all regions, an important result of the work that the North American team has done to strengthen our business. The Midwest, West and Metro regions led the way during this quarter.", "Also important for the North American business are the 2 largest practices, Human Capital and Construction. Both performed well. Human Capital put up strong organic growth in the quarter, coming in at high single digits. With Human Capital making up more than 20% of our revenues in North America, that is an important and robust result. Construction, our second-largest practice, grew revenues by low double digits. We remain bullish on our Construction business, as activity is clearly stronger than in the year-ago period. We also saw good results in other industry practices, including Financial Services, Tech and Telecom and Mergers and Acquisitions.", "Before moving on from North America, I want to thank, once again, Vic Krauze for the tremendous job he did in guiding our largest business through one of its most challenging periods, returning it to growth and improving profitability. I look forward to Vic's continued guidance and counsel in his role as the Chairman of Willis North America.", "Let's now move to Willis International. Willis International grew by a modest 2.6% in the second quarter, which was below the level we have come to expect but was affected by some delayed revenues. This portfolio comprises a variety of businesses, including some underperformers, as well as real stars, operating in some of the most challenging as well as exciting markets. Now I don't want to steal Tim's thunder for the Investor Day, but he and his team are implementing a range of compelling strategies to maintain or improve on the performance we have previously seen from international.", "Let me provide some detail of International's results for the quarter by region. Western Europe, despite generally weak economic conditions, reported a low single digit increase in revenue. This was led by strong performances in Sweden and Denmark on the back of new business wins, and modest but still positive low-single digit growth in Iberia and Italy. Offsetting this were declines in countries such as Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands.", "In Eastern Europe, a growing market for us, we saw a double-digit growth, primarily driven by our performance in Russia. In the U.K., our business was down low-single digits in the quarter. However, we believe that the actions we have taken to build positive long-term growth in the U.K. are progressing well.", "In Latin America, we saw another quarter of great results, with growth in the double digits. While the drivers of growth were different in each country, Brazil, Argentina and Peru were especially strong during the period. Additionally, our Venezuela operations had another very strong quarter.", "In Asia, we were up mid-single digits, with double-digit growth in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Taiwan. That growth was partially offset by declines in Korea and Hong Kong.", "Finally, Australasia declined mid-single digits in the quarter, attributable to a decline in revenues in Australia. Uncertain economic conditions and upcoming elections, together with some delayed revenues had an effect on our results, but we believe that the improvement we had started to see over the last couple of quarters remains on track.", "You could see from the description of this quarter's results that International is generally performing fine. What is driving the business' growth down has been the U.K. and much of Western Europe, both for obvious reasons. We are working diligently on strategies that will drive better results from those slower growth markets and remain confident that International will generate long-term growth in its historic 4% to 6% range.", "Let's now move to Willis Global. Willis Global comprises Willis Re, Specialty, Placement and Willis Capital Markets and Advisory. Willis Global had a very strong quarter, with organic growth of 10.3%. Willis Re led the way, reporting growth in the mid-teens. In turn, Willis Re was led by North America reinsurance, once again driving growth with strong new business wins and solid retention. International and specialty reinsurance both grew solidly in the mid-single digit range. This was an impressive result, once again, for our reinsurance colleagues around the globe.", "The Global Specialty businesses of Willis Global were up mid-single digits, delivering good growth from new business. Across the various specialty businesses, we experienced areas of over and underperformance as expected, but most notable was the strong performance delivered by our energy team during the quarter.", "With that, I will turn it over to Mike to discuss the rest of the financial results. I'll return later with some final comments, before turning it over to you for questions.", "Michael K. Neborak", "Thank you, Dominic, and good day, everyone. During my comments, I will be referring to the slide presentation that is posted on our website. In reviewing the numbers, all comparisons are to the second quarter 2012, unless otherwise stated.", "As Dominic mentioned, we continue to deliver solid underlying results, driven by 6.3% organic commission and fee growth. The published numbers on Slide 3, however, show adjusted EPS of $0.59, flat to Q2 2012, and adjusted operating income of $171 million, down slightly from $174 million. This warrants some further discussion. In fact, the year-over-year comparison is much stronger after eliminating the unfavorable impact from 2 items. First, foreign exchange movements, which reduced operating income this quarter by $11 million. Second, the change in our remuneration policy from retention award amortization to bonus accrual, which distorts the prior-year comparison by $12 million. When you factor out those 2 items, you see a different picture, amounting to an adjusted operating income that increased by $20 million or 12%.", "In analyzing our adjusted operating margin, you should understand that the quarter-over-quarter decline is more than offset by those 2 items, the change in our remuneration policy and unfavorable foreign exchange movements. When adjusted for these items, our adjusted operating margin actually increased by 110 basis points in contrast to the 150-basis point decline that is shown on Slide 3. I hope that explanation helps in clarifying questions about margin that may be on your mind.", "Now in looking at our second quarter 2013 adjusted EPS of $0.59, please follow the progression that I'm about to lay out. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased EPS by $0.05 and the lower tax rate in the quarter increased EPS by $0.03. As such, EPS for the second quarter 2013 on an underlying basis is $0.61. This compares to $0.54 in the second quarter 2012 after adjusting for the $0.05 impact from changing the remuneration policy. So taking all that into account, the way we look at it, this results in a $0.07 or 13% increase in adjusted EPS from $0.54 to $0.61.", "Now let me explain our total expense growth in more detail on Slide 4. Underlying growth in total expenses was 7.0%. But we know that is an uneven comparison because of the change in remuneration policy that we made at the end of last year.", "That discussion brings us to Slide 5, which summarizes the quarterly impact from changing that policy. As discussed in the previous quarter, our S&B expense for the full year 2012 actually would have been $48 million higher had we been accruing for annual cash bonuses throughout 2012, the way we are doing it now, instead of amortizing retention rewards. The second quarter impact from this change was $12 million. You can see that the quarterly impact is somewhat uneven, so we will continue to provide this slide each quarter through year end. It is important to remember this change had no impact on cash flow.", "Now let me provide some details on the component pieces of our expense growth. Turning to Slide 6, please note the quarterly comparison of salaries and benefits. Underlying S&B expense increased 6.4%, and the main drivers of the increase were a combination of factors. First, increased headcount of approximately 450 people since July 1, 2012. Second, increased production incentive payments that resulted from higher commissions and fees generating -- generated thus far in 2013. And third, the year-over-year impact of annual salary increases. Favorable foreign exchange movements of $3 million partially offset these factors.", "In addition to this comparison is the effect of changing the remuneration policy that I just described. So to cover this, please turn to Slide 7.", "On Slide 7, S&B growth is laid out assuming that we had accrued bonuses throughout 2012, as we are doing today. This is to provide what I would call an apples-to-apples comparison. As you can see, on this comparable basis, underlying S&B growth was 3.9% or 250 basis points lower than the straight comparison.", "Slide 8 shows the quarterly comparison of other operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, other operating expenses grew 10.4% in the quarter.", "That was the summary of our reported and our underlying expenses. But as you saw in our press release, we commented on some items that flowed through both our salaries and benefits line and our other operating expense line this quarter. Our S&B expense this quarter benefited by $10 million of compensation-related accrual reversals. Conversely, our other operating expenses were hurt by $7 million of VAT-related expenses. So with all that laid out, to get to a true growth rate on our component expenses, you might want to adjust for those items that I just described.", "Here's how that math works out. With all the adjustments made, S&B growth was 5.9% and other operating expense growth was 5.2%. I know I've thrown a lot of numbers at you, and I'll be happy to take further questions on them when Dominic concludes his remarks. But hopefully, this now gives you a better understanding of our expense growth.", "Now moving to taxes. Similar to last quarter, the 21% tax rate in the quarter was primarily driven by the low tax charge against our U.S. income. As a reminder, our U.S. operations are in a cumulative 3-year loss position due to the goodwill impairment in a number of one-off charges recorded in 2011 and 2012. This requires us to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, so that very little tax charge is booked against our U.S. income. We expect that this will be the case until our U.S. operations are beyond the cumulative 3-year loss position period, which is likely sometime in 2015.", "Now let me comment on the associates line, which as you all know is primarily Gras Savoye. In the second quarter of 2013, this line showed a loss of $3 million, compared to a loss of $1 million in the year ago quarter. For the full year 2013, we continue to expect that the Associates line will come in lower than last year, as Gras Savoye completes its operational review. As such, at this time, we still expect the associates line to be a loss of $1 million to $3 million for the full year 2013.", "Let me wrap up my comments with some thoughts on the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $503 million of cash. Total debt outstanding at June 30 was $2.3 billion, down slightly from year end. And during the quarter, we paid down the $55 million balance that was outstanding on our revolver at the end of the first quarter. Lastly, we just amended our credit facility. The key points on the amendment are: We pushed out the maturity date on our term loan and revolver to July 2018 from December 2016. And we also increased the size of our revolver from $500 million to $800 million, which simply provides us with more flexibility as we move forward.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Dominic.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Thanks, Mike. To sum up, I am pleased, once again, with our top line growth. I feel that we are delivering on the initiatives that have been discussed over the past several quarters going back to late 2011. There are many things that affect our performance, pipeline development and management, producer growth and development and planned retention initiatives are all having the desired effect that we had anticipated and discussed with you in prior quarters.", "We believe, however, that there is more work to do and more improvements to be made. Our goal is to be the best at what we do and to achieve that goal, we need to continually strengthen our already outstanding service and analytics to our clients to provide them with resilience for a risky world.", "For those of you who have signed up to attend our Investor Day next Tuesday, July 30, or are planning to watch or listen to the webcast, I look forward to the discussion of our strategies on how we plan to serve our clients and thereby grow our business into the future.", "Thank you. We will now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Thomas Mitchell of Miller Tabak.", "Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division", "I had one question about the North American business in that of course the comparison of 2012 to 2011 was down 3% for commissions and fees, so that 2013 is really up about a little over 2% from second quarter of 2011. I'm wondering if the underlying trends that you described, obviously, they're positive versus 2012. But on a continuing basis, is there something underneath that is keeping that business from returning to a more robust level?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Well, let me give a quick overview here of how we think about that, and then I'm going to hand it over to Todd Jones. I think we are very excited about the momentum we see in this business. We all know that this business suffered a period when we were losing some producers and business was actually shrinking. And so I think the correct momentum comparison is how we are seeing continued growth both in retentions, new business won and the producer, of course. And the forward momentum is extremely positive. But let me hand over to Todd to provide any color on that.", "Todd Jones", "In terms of what we see going forward and obviously as you know we don't necessarily provide segment-related guidance, but the plan for us in North America is frankly to continue to build on those foundational elements that we've seen take hold over the course of the last 3 quarters, and we're confident that we can continue to refine and build on those elements to continue to drive good results. And we're obviously optimistic about not only the balance of the year, but as this business -- as we continue to move forward.", "Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then is the process of delays and sort of questions in the Affordable Healthcare Act affecting your business one way or the other?", "Todd Jones", "Yes, good question, and it's affecting it in a positive way. As you can imagine, this time extension gives us the opportunity to, frankly, provide more counsel and guidance to folks that are sort of struggling with how this is going to impact. As you probably saw, there was a bill that was introduced to delay it an additional year, so that just gives us even more time potentially to get out there, offer some solutions, talk about our tools and deliver the expertise that we bill to the client. So we think it's a positive thing.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Hughes of SunTrust.", "Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on that question. How much of the growth you think is related to the, let's say, uncertainty caused by the healthcare -- just healthcare reform, in general?", "Todd Jones", "This is Todd, that's a really hard one to answer. And I would literally be pulling a number out if I gave it to you. But clearly, it's created an opportunity for us, and we're confident it will continue to create an opportunity. But we're not necessarily capturing growth in that framework.", "Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Could you give a little more granularity on the rates and the P&C space, specifically in North America? How you saw 2Q as compared to Q1? And then how they might be trending just very recently?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "So let me just start by reiterating what I'd said before, which is when people ask us about rate, I do like to remind them that we are affected by global rates. We are a global firm. And so rates, yes, in the North American P&C market are clearly important to us, but so are Brazilian facultative risk rates, so are rates in Western Europe, so are rates and what's happening in Asia. So that the -- when we think about rate, the diversity of what we do gives us quite a lot of softening of particular volatility in any one market. With that, let me have Todd address your specific question about North America.", "Todd Jones", "Yes, so we definitely saw rates slower in Q2 than we did in Q1, with one exception related to worker's comp. And if you saw some of the material that we had put out in our Marketplace Realities for the balance of the year on some of the major lines, i.e., property, we're definitely showing a trend towards flattening to modestly down. Clearly, that's going to be dependent upon the season we're entering, as far as the storms. But we are definitely seeing a flattening to modestly trending down rate environment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Farrell of Sterne Agee.", "Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. Firstly, you had a very strong result, I think, in the reinsurance brokerage, particularly given some of the comments we are hearing on market conditions. I was wondering if you could talk about and expand a little bit more on what's driving the strong organic? And then also how you think about sustainability there, as we go forward?", "Steven P. Hearn", "It's Steven. Great question, thank you. Quickly, congratulations to our reinsurance team who did an outstanding job in the quarter. Across our reinsurance business, but as we've highlighted in our North American business, particularly, and I guess at the heart of your question is, was it timing? Is it sustainable? For a number of quarters, I've highlighted Willis Re very much as one of the jewels in Willis' crown. And actually what drove our number in Q2 and in North America was high new business performance and strong retention. New business in reinsurance, as I'm sure you know, has a long lead time. So in fact what you saw manifest in Q2 was actually work of last year, as well as earlier in this year, i.e., the award or the contract and when the money actually turns up being 2 different times. In terms of its sustainability, and there's been a lot of comment, particularly around new capital. And certainly, we have seen an impact on new capital in parts of the reinsurance book. Any new capital of any size is obviously going to have an impact on rate. At the moment, the impact is fairly concentrated to the property CAT world in North America. And again, this raises, I think, a really important point because new capacity and rate reduction doesn't necessarily correlate to reduced commission and fee income for a reinsurance broker. The standout business unit for Willis Re in Q2 was North America and North America is where the impact has been of this capacity. So that's a good illustration of that as fact. The client may well see reduced spend in terms of the rate impact. But for us, it's new earnings, new revenue, new business wins. So you've really got to analyze what's going on in a reinsurance broker's book to understand the rate impact. For us, good new business growth in Q2 and good, strong retention is what's driving those numbers.", "Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then just one other question. You did have margin growth, if you make all of the adjustments in this quarter and last quarter. But with the strong organic, I would've thought that the margin could have been even better. Is there still some other stuff that is sort of holding back the operating leverage? And how do you think about margin trending going forward?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Well, we're going to talk about this a bit in the Investor Day. But I think our view is that we should be continuing to invest in our growth opportunities. And we did, in this period over the last 12 months, we've been looking to add people in our growth markets and, of course, we continue to invest in analytics. And so that there's a natural investment to drive growth in the top line. In parallel with that, of course, we continue to take a very tough look at lower growth areas and fixed cost areas to get more operating leverage and we remain committed to making sure that we have a positive gap between revenues and costs over the medium term. But we'll talk about this more in the Investor Day.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of questions. The first one, I'm sorry if I missed this, if Todd, you said this. But on the Human Capital business growth, was there any impact year-over-year from the contingent commissions?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "It was a very small impact. It was less than $1 million.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. When are we going to start seeing kind of the real impact of that? Because I know it was one of the changes that went on in that business.", "Todd Jones", "Brian, I think the expectation is that's going to continue to ramp up during the course of the rest of this year and into the first quarter next year. And we'll start to see, as we get to more normalized state in second quarter and beyond next year, in terms of the impact of contingents on that Human Capital book.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And then back on the reinsurance book, just curious, was any of the growth bolstered by Willis Capital Markets?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "It's not in our treaty operation. We don't add that number into Willis Re's results. Willis Capital Markets is a separate business.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And how did that do during the quarter?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "It did fine. It did grow, but modestly.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got you. And just lastly, on the reinsurance business, you've always been having a lot of success with new businesses, Dom. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about why do you think you're winning on this new business? Is it coming from competitors? Is it new programs, stuff being put on? If you could kind of drill down a little bit on that, that would be great.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "I would be delighted to, only too delighted to. And I apologize in advance for the advert -- for advertising, we're the best. No, but in all seriousness, we focused a lot of effort around our reinsurance business over the last couple of years, particularly investment in analytics and differentiating our analytics proposition from even our larger competitors in this space in terms of embedded analytics totally into our proposition, so our proposition clear to the client in terms of content and in terms of the analytics and transactional capability being brought together. We're very focused in terms of new business. We only go for business where we feel we can add significant value to the client and reject other opportunities. So we don't just respond to every RFP or tender opportunity that we're offered. We're very focused in that regard and we've been highly successful. We've won pretty much every opportunity we've turned our attention to during the course of last year and into this year as well. It's been very successful.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just a clarification. Do alternative -- within the reinsurance, do alternative market transaction, in other words, if you help organize the CAT fund, does that fall on Reinsurance or Capital Markets?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Yes, fundamentally, in to our Capital Markets business. It may be an opportunity as uncovered or discovered, I guess, by our reinsurance relationship with an organization. But, no, the transaction and execution is done by our Capital Markets business.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. Has there been reasonable growth in your fees related to those transactions?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "I would say there's been more activity. As I said, our Capital Markets business revenue has grown in the quarter, albeit modestly. But there's certainly been more activity, yes.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, different topic. There's been a lot of talk about one of your competitors is doing a quarter-share-like transaction with Berkshire in London. Are you doing any type of similar structures?", "Steven P. Hearn", "That probably falls to me, it's Steve, again. Yes and no would be the answer. One, we should say that what our competitor did with that particular capacity provider isn't perhaps as revolutionary as it's been heralded. There are similar arrangements. In fact, we operate one on our energy portfolio and have done so for a number of years. We are -- we have put together a proposition which we are marketing across the carrier community at the moment, seeking capacity to under the banner of Global 360. We think we've done it very differently than our competitors, in terms of canvassing widely to see which carriers offer best solution to our client, the client very much at the center of our discovery here of what's available. And we continue to consider propositions that had been put to us. But so the answer is yes, we are doing something. But is it a clone of something one of our competitors has done? Not at all.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. In Human Capital, obviously, nice quarter. Could you give us an idea how much of the growth has come from more traditional brokerage placement business versus HR consulting business or benefit consulting business?", "Todd Jones", "Yes, it is -- most of the growth is the transactional business that we're seeing. So the traditional broking business, we are absolutely seeing an increase in activity on the consulting side. And as I think we mentioned earlier, just healthcare reform and some of the challenges in any organization on how to comply and what it means and goals and objectives, create benefit programs, create a lot of opportunity to discuss and sell solutions. But at the end of the day, majority of it was transactional.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, and is that being helped by increased rates in healthcare? Or is that more market share gains?", "Michael K. Neborak", "I'd call market share gains.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then as far as the construction. Obviously, nicely that area grow. And I know you have a big practice there. Is that more smaller risks, or is that larger construction taken off?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Yes, it's actually -- I'd say it's a little bit of both. Clearly, we're seeing an uptick in the project work, as financing continues to come back online. So we're definitely seeing some of the larger projects, but it really sort of cuts across the whole spectrum of opportunities.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Dominic, I think that last quarter, you implied that margin improvement in Global would be more kind of back-half-of-the-year loaded. It looks like it came in a bit earlier this time? And I was just curious was it may be less investments in the second quarter? Or was it just that revenues grew faster than you expected? Or can you just -- a little context on that? That would be great.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Well, I'll give a first perspective and then go back to Steve. I think we saw very strong revenue growth this quarter, which obviously had the resulting effect on -- close through to margin. And we were very pleased with that. But, Steve, do you want to add anything to that?", "Steven P. Hearn", "Sure. Yes, we had -- clearly, we had very, very strong new business growth, as I've mentioned before, particularly in one area of our business, which had an effect on the overall result, clearly, as I said, our North American reinsurance business performed particularly well. And again, I think in the last quarter, we referred to the other part of Global, which drives some of the expense investments. So we have responsibility for running the regulated entity in the U.K., Willis Limited, and there are some increasing costs around U.K. regulation. And secondly, we have responsibility in Global for the placement activity for the entire organization in terms of our carrier management function. And by example, the investment in Will Place. And again, that drives some of the expense growth that you see in Global. But the business units themselves, the core bits of Willis Re, Specialty, Willis Capital Markets are showing generally good growth in revenue, relative to the growth in total operating expense.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. So that's not -- the second quarter is not a pull-forward, if you will, of kind of the margin mix, okay.", "Steven P. Hearn", "We're not benefiting from timing on either line, no. It's true result.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, just one question back on Re. I guess it's great you're certainly winning new business. And retention, it sounds like it's very strong as well. I guess I'm just a little surprised that alternative capital either hasn't been maybe more disruptive or that hasn't been an area, a larger contributor of growth. I mean, maybe I think John had mentioned a pipeline and that it takes time for these transactions to move through. I mean, if we look at that pipeline from here, what do we see? And is there any color on the Capital Markets side, where maybe some of that activity might be on the come.", "Steven P. Hearn", "Yes, I'll probably give 3 quick answers. One will be a little bit of repetition. For us, North America performed very strongly for us on reinsurance. We are a significant intermediary in Florida. And yet, Florida is where the impact of new capital is probably been felt the greatest in the reinsurance world. So, please, there isn't a correlation necessarily between rate and what a broker, reinsurance broker, will earn. Reason for us, particularly year-on-year, is we won a lot of new business from our competitors last year. It wasn't in our revenue last year, and it is in our revenue this year as a new business. The client's rate may have gone down. They might actually choose to buy more, but the rate has gone down. But that doesn't necessarily mean it reduces our earnings in that case because it's new business. It's 100% growth for us, if you like, at a client level. Secondly, longer-term prognosis in terms of capital -- new capital in the reinsurance world, if not the insurance world, is subject to lots of debate at the moment internally, externally, with clients, et cetera. And you'll hear very, very different views of how fickle, sustainable, that new capital may or may not be. My personal opinion is that it is a significant development and certainly has the potential to be significant. But that's not certainly a Willis comment. We have plenty of opportunity to earn, both from the arrival of this new capital in terms of advising our clients, as well as, frankly, given our relative market share and opportunity for us to develop conquest business from our competitors. So I don't see it as a threat for us.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And last one, it just sounds like you're growing your share of a shrinking pie, if the pie is shrinking because the alternative capital stuff is coming in -- would come in to you through a different part of your business. So I guess that would -- it would sound like even more pronounced in terms of your taking market share from Pierce. Does that make sense or is that's not right?", "Steven P. Hearn", "Yes, sort of. It does, it does make sense. The real thing that's driving our reinsurance business at the moment is retention of existing clients and acquisition or conquest business from our competitors. Traditional reinsurance business that we are winning from our competitors.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, for Mike, the tax rate. Obviously, first half was relatively low and you talk about, I guess, using some of the deferred tax asset. Can you -- given that situation, can you give us some guidance what the tax rate should look like in the second half and in 2014?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Okay, so Jay, so it's rather complicated. And I say that because it has -- it's very sensitive to where that income comes in geographically. So, for example, here in the second quarter, I think at the end of the first quarter, I had mentioned that our tax rate in the Q2, 3 and 4 would be somewhere between 22% and 26% each of those quarters. And we came in here in the second quarter at rounded up to 21%. So I was a little bit low and off that range, principally because more income came in, in North America than what we had budgeted for. So the sensitivity of the situation is that it's a little bit perverse. The more income we have in North America, the lower our tax rate is going to be overall because that income is not getting a tax rate against it. So what I would tell you is that for the full year, I believe the full year rate will come in somewhere between 22% and 24%. Obviously, if we booked a tax rate of 19% in the first quarter and 21% in the second quarter, it's going to be higher in Q3 and Q4. I'd like to just characterize it as 22% to 24% for the whole year. Q3 is very difficult because it's our smallest net income quarter, so it's really sensitive to where the changes might be in the geographic distribution of that income.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "What about for next year at this point? I mean, it should still be, I would assume, aided by your tax situation.", "Michael K. Neborak", "Next year is going to be similar, at least as we see right now to our situation here in 2013 because we'll still be within this 3-year loss period, if you will. So, therefore, more or less not permitted under GAAP to book a tax provision against our North America profits.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So somewhere in 22% and 24% for next year as well?", "Michael K. Neborak", "I'm sorry, Jay?", "Catherine A. Seifert - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research", "I'm sorry, somewhere between 22% and 24% for 2014, as well?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Can you -- this is just for -- a few modeling questions. The VAT charge and the accrual reversal, what segment were those? Where did they hit?", "Michael K. Neborak", "So the VAT charge, about $5 million was in International and $2 million within our Global segment. So that's the $7 million. And then the accrual reverse basically was $5 million positive in Global, $3 million in International and $2 million in North America.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. I think Dominic had mentioned 450 people added since the end of June or end of July of last year. Can you give us a sense of the timing of that so we can sort of expect it in expense growth?", "Michael K. Neborak", "So 450 people. Just to give you -- so most of those happened in the third and fourth quarter of 2012 on a net basis. Here in 2013, I think we've added 80 people.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And Dominic also mentioned delayed revenue to the International segment. Is that something that we should anticipate coming back in the third quarter?", "Michael K. Neborak", "I think what Dominic meant delayed revenue meaning deals that got delayed, pushed into the third quarter, which kind of -- is an ongoing occurrence each quarter. So I think our third quarter -- I don't think you should look at our third quarter as being impacted by that comment. It's going to happen kind of -- and not be impacted very substantially by that at all.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And do the modified credit facilities have any impact on the run rate for interest expense?", "Michael K. Neborak", "No. They were all renewed at the same LIBOR plus 150 basis points that we currently pay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Sorry, I wanted to touch base on the pretax adjusted margin. I know there were a bunch of onetime items in 2Q, and I'm just trying to get a sense, compared to the second half of 2012, is there anything to prevent that pretax adjusted margin improving, relative to the as-stated numbers from back half of '12? I just want to get a sense if there -- or any other anticipated onetime items.", "Michael K. Neborak", "Well there's no anticipated onetime items in Q3 and Q4 coming up. I have to recall what happened in Q3 and Q4 last year. Maybe we can handle that off-line because I just don't recall what was there, but we certainly can go back and find that out for you.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, more importantly, directionally, when you talk about the underlying perspective in 2Q, obviously you're showing 110 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year, but for a couple items. I mean, is there anything that prevent that from not showing up in the back half, in terms of dated margin improvement?", "Michael K. Neborak", "We have to grow our revenues, like we grew our revenues here in the second quarter. And as Dominic mentioned, we continue to invest quite a bit in our growth markets and, at the same time, we're looking hard at reducing the cost in our lower growth markets.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "I think we'll talk about this more at the Investor Day.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. And then has there been -- given any thoughts to resuming share buybacks, since there hasn't been any for the past 3 quarters?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Well, right now we have no plans to do share buyback, but we're going to talk about the topic of capital allocation very, very specifically at Investor Day on Tuesday.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Two quick ones. You had talked a little bit about rates in North America and you'd kind of gone through some of the different major categories, and I only caught part of that. Could you -- I know you mentioned property, specifically, that you are seeing that might soften. Can you just go through those major categories that you outlined, again, for me?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Yes, so I'll bucket it in just 3 areas: property, casualty and then financial lines, which we track as well. So in the property market, we see for the balance of year sort of a flattening to a modestly downward trend. In the casualty market, call it flattening to still modestly up, and a lot of that is going to depend upon jurisdiction, obviously, but not the same kind of trend we're seeing in property. And in financial lines, similar as to what I said in property, sort of flat to modestly down.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "And the drivers of that, is this just an excess capital question? Is it, maybe, underwriters not being as disciplined? Sort of what's the driver of those?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Well, I won't call it lack of underwriting discipline. But I'll -- definitely excess capital. Certainly, performance of the underlying portfolios within the various underwriters. And, frankly, the lack of catastrophes that we've seen in some of those areas as well. So all of those things kind of combined to create an environment depending -- again, depending largely on the product and the geography that you're operating in.", "Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great, that's helpful. And then one final question, too. I think you talked about construction as being particularly strong or a highlight in, I think it was North America. Can you just comment on that? It sounds like it's up year-over-year. But any particular color you can give us on that will be helpful.", "Todd Jones", "Sure. This is Todd again. Construction had a terrific quarter and I, too, would like to offer my congratulations to my colleagues in that business. And it wasn't in one specific area. We saw it across all of our geographies, both in terms of size, of projects, sort of large and small. So it was really a balanced recovery, one I think aided by an improving finance market and some of these deals getting funded, but also the fact that we just had a very large and differentiated construction business across North America.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, just one quick follow-up. On the financing, Mike, or actions, I guess, in terms of kind of delaying the maturity age of the revolver in the credit facility. Anything coincident about that in the option date of the Gras Savoye transaction.", "Michael K. Neborak", "Well, I think we look at that, as well as a lot of other opportunities that may come to be in the market. And so we had the opportunity to extend it out and to increase the size of the revolver, which just gives us a lot more financial flexibility. So we took the opportunity that was presented to give us more financial flexibility, which may be helpful in Gras Savoye, might not, depending on what we decide to do about the option, and then just in a normal course of operating our business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to go over the headcount a little bit more. You said you added, I guess, 80 people since the beginning of the year. I wondered if you could talk about what the gross adds were? The people you added, whether they were client-facing or not, and where you've been growing?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Generally -- it's Dominic here. We've been adding people in line with our strategy. So we're, obviously, adding people in where we see revenue growing opportunities. So in the growth markets, in Tim Wright's world of International. And we definitely added some people in Steve's world of Global and there had been some public announcements about that, about some people that had been added in that world. And Todd had -- continues to have year-on-year growth in the producer model. So when you added all that up, you see growth. At the same time as we grow the business, you have to moderately continue to grow the fixed infrastructure, compliance, audit, et cetera, take account of more activity.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "To what extent -- have the new hires brought in new business at this point in time? And that's fueling some growth made particularly on the reinsurance side?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Steve?", "Steven P. Hearn", "I probably think -- 2 comments, one to just elaborate on something Dominic said. But, yes, I can pick up the Re one, as well. In the Global number, will be headcount that came to us through an acquisition in London, which is of Prime Professions, which was an acquisition for us that I think brought in about 45 people. So you'll see that in Global. And then as Dominic says, we continue to invest in high-growth, high-margin operations. That includes our Reinsurance business, and we have hired some people in there and absolutely focused on production and client service and analytics, absolutely. This isn't about filling out back-office positions. It's very much about client-facing and dividend.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And to the extent that reinsurance growth related to new hires?", "Steven P. Hearn", "No, you won't. As I said earlier, the key driver of revenue in Q2 was new business we won last year and business that we or on RFP tend to response, et cetera, last year. So it was existing resource. But, absolutely, as we bring in production staff into reinsurance, hopefully you'll see that recognized in successful growth going forward, for sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Meyer Shields, KBW.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just one that I missed. The corporate and other expense line was, I guess, lower than it had been for a while, $19 million. Is that a good run rate going forward?", "Michael K. Neborak", "That's a good number. It's usually around somewhere between $20 million and $25 million. Sometimes as low as $15 million. But $19 million is a good number. It jumps around a lot because we have, obviously , items in there that are related to certain foreign exchange hit record in to corporate, balance sheet foreign exchange typically gets recorded in to corporate, so it does jump around. I mean, things like the amortization of our intangibles, which we keep are steady. But then there are items that create a little bit of volatility, like some of the foreign exchange that ends up being booked there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Thomas Mitchell of Miller Tabak.", "Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division", "This is just a short follow-up. On the reinsurance business, we've heard that there seems to be a trend. Maybe it's a relatively long-term trend for primary insurers to gradually become increasingly sophisticated in their decisions on whether they're going to buy reinsurance or keep business, and where they -- slicing and dicing it by lines and by tranches. I'm wondering if that feeds into your strength or even if you agree that, that is a trend? I'm just interested in your comments.", "Steven P. Hearn", "So yes, the trend is absolutely right. It's developed over a number of years, the client, in effect, becoming more sophisticated, their needs and understanding becoming more sophisticated. And this is really where analytics has come to its fore, being able to, as you describe it, slice and dice a portfolio to optimize the reinsurance spend in terms of where the premium's going to and what they're shifting from their own balance sheet into the reinsurance community, absolutely is becoming increasingly sophisticated. That plays to the intermediary who best deploys analytic capability to their client base. And I think we do that exceptionally well. And certainly in any research that we've done blindly on the reinsurance buyer's perspective on Willis Re, the feedback is generally, if not always, that we have a very, very strong analytics proposition, as well as very strong broking talent in terms of execution. So as the client becomes more sophisticated in their needs, we've been able to deliver upon those needs. And I would attribute a lot of the recent success to being very good at it.", "Operator", "At this time, we have no further questions.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Well, thank you, all, very much for your attention. And we look forward to seeing those of you who are able to join us on Tuesday at our investor conference in New York.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.", "I'll now turn the call over to Dominic.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Welcome, and thank you for joining our quarterly conference call. By now, you've had a chance to read the news release that we put out last night and have a copy of our slides at the ready. With me today are Michael Neborak, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Hearn, our Deputy CEO and Head of Willis Global; Tim Wright, Head of Willis International; and Todd Jones, Head of Willis North America.", "As usual, we will be happy to answer your questions after Mike and I offer our introductory remarks.", "So let me turn to an overview of our results.", "Overall, these results are in line with the targets we laid out at our investor conference in July. Revenue growth in the mid-single digits, a positive spread between revenue and cost growth and good cash flow generation, all of which underpins, in our view, shareholder value creation. We, as an organization, are very pleased to have achieved those targets this quarter. However, to be clear, we told you during our investor conference that we may not hit those targets every quarter. In fact, it is likely that there will be quarters when we exceed them and quarters when we miss. Our goal is to achieve the targets on average over the near medium term.", "This quarter, we continued making steady progress in growing our top line, delivering 5.7% organic growth. We are pleased with that. Importantly, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of solid organic growth in each of our segments: Willis North America, Willis International and Willis Global.", "International led the way with 7.8% growth, while Global and North America grew nicely at 6.4% and 3.9%, respectively. I congratulate each of the leaders at all of our associates around the globe for their great efforts in continuing the strong performance in revenue growth over the past 12 months.", "Now, our reported GAAP earnings were negative $0.15 per share in the current quarter, but that result was impacted by the $61 million net charge we took in August related to the refinancing activities that we executed to take advantage of the favorable debt markets. As a result of that refinancing, we pushed out maturities, issued our first ever 30-year debt and reduced the overall cost of our debt. On an adjusted basis, meaning excluding the early extinguishment charges, adjusted earnings per share were $0.19. This compares to adjusted earnings per share of $0.22 in the year-ago quarter. However, once again this quarter, this is not really an apples-to-apples comparison. Had we accrued bonuses throughout 2012, instead of amortizing retention awards, our third quarter 2012 salary and benefits would have been $17 million higher and our adjusted earnings per diluted share would have been $0.07 lower. So on an apples-to-apples comparison, the $0.19 in third quarter 2013 compares with $0.15 in the year-ago quarter. We discussed that in our press release and Mike will walk you through that in greater detail shortly.", "So let's spend a few minutes looking at each of the businesses in some detail. I'll start with Willis North America. As I mentioned, North America achieved 3.9% organic growth in the quarter. This is another solid result that is essentially in line with what we've seen out of this segment now for 4 straight quarters. Importantly, growth in the quarter was again largely driven by new business wins. While rates were generally positive, we estimate that they accounted for a little less than 1/3 of our growth during the quarter. It's very good news that North America's growth was well distributed geographically across most regions, an important result of the work that the North American team has done to strengthen our business. The Midwest, Metro and West regions led the way during this quarter.", "Looking at the growth from a different perspective, analyzing our industry and practice segmentation, we saw growth in both of North America's largest practices: Human Capital and Construction. Human Capital recorded low-single digit organic growth, excluding market derived commission, such as contingent commissions in the quarter and construction grew by mid-single digits.", "While we're on the subject of Human Capital, I thought it may be helpful if I provide a brief update on the Willis Advantage. The Willis Advantage is a private exchange that delivers a range of healthcare solutions primarily to middle market commercial clients in the United States. We define the middle market as anywhere from 100 to 5,000 lives. The Willis Advantage enables employers to administer benefits within a defined contribution model, structured around an online insurance marketplace with robust decision support tools. We announced our insurance exchange offering in May of this year, presuming that our clients will be looking at it as a potential alternative for 2014 and beyond.", "We believe that our offering is unique in that we're the only entity that has an approach to address the underlying cost of healthcare by integrating a health management approach as an option. We've asked carriers to provide enhanced terms and conditions for clients that adopt our formal health outcomes program as part of their exchange solution. And thus far, many have agreed to enhanced underwriting terms and conditions, including first year premium reductions to account for the better than average risk.", "Clients and prospects have been very receptive to our approach and we have had significant interest. We're engaged with literally hundreds of clients and prospects, and currently have 30 to 40 clients and prospects in advanced discussions for 2014 enrollments and another 30 to 40 clients for 2015 enrollments.", "Additionally, we have had numerous marketing opportunities to be in front of prospects to discuss Willis' insurance exchange platform, as well as Human Capital capabilities beyond exchanges and that had been, and we expect will be, a factor in the growth in that practice.", "Let's now move to Willis International. Willis International grew strongly at 7.8% in the third quarter, bringing organic growth for the 9 months to 4.5%. The third quarter growth was a very good result given some of the challenges we continue to experience in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, which together, made up around 50% of International's revenues in the quarter.", "In the U.K., our business was down mid-single digits in the quarter as we continue to work to turn that region around as we've discussed during our investor conference. On a positive note, the U.K. real estate business performed very well in the quarter. In Western Europe, amidst continued generally weak economic conditions, we reported essentially flat revenue growth. However, once again, there were marked differences between countries with strong performances in Iberia, Sweden and Norway on the back of new business wins and solid retention. Those gains were offset by declines elsewhere, primarily in Germany and Italy.", "With these results in the U.K. and Western Europe, there were clearly very strong results elsewhere around the world to get us to 7.8% overall growth for Willis International. So let me provide some detail of international results for the quarter in the other regions.", "In Eastern Europe, we recorded growth in excess of 10%, primarily driven by our performance in Russia, which grew mid-teens. Latin America grew solidly once again with mid-teens organic growth. Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela were particularly strong during the period with excellent new business wins. Asia had an exceptionally strong double-digit growth quarter with very strong growth in Hong Kong and China.", "Finally, Australasia had a very good quarter, with growth in excess of 10%, partly as a result of revenue timing that moved from the second quarter as we described last quarter, and partly driven by a pickup of new business and very strong retention in the regions. This was the best quarter for our Australian business in some time and a sign of the progress we have been making to improve our operations there.", "Tim Wright told you during the investor conference in July that the International team is reviewing businesses that do not fit our core strengths and competencies around the globe. For instance, during the quarter, we sold our book of small commercial clients in England and will now focus on serving that type of client base by our Willis Commercial Network. And it's worth noting that the buyer of that book of business is a member of the Willis Commercial Network.", "Let's now move to Willis Global. Willis Global comprises Willis REIT, specialty, placement and Willis capital markets and advisory. Willis Global had another good quarter with organic growth of 6.4%. Willis Re led the way again with growth in the high-single digits. The Specialties Reinsurance business stood out, recording growth in the mid-teens, driven by broad new business growth and improved retention rates. Within specialties reinsurance both Marine and Non-marine businesses were strong.", "North American reinsurance business recorded growth in the high-single digits with solid new business across the region. International Reinsurance business grew mid-single digits with solid growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific, offset by a decline in Latin America. The Global Specialty businesses grew mid-single digits with good growth from new business and continued solid retention. The Specialties business achieved strong performance in financial and executive risks, fine art, jewelry and specie and construction. Willis Capital Markets & Advisory revenues in the quarter were essentially flat to last year's comparable quarter.", "With that, I will turn it over to Mike to discuss the rest of the financial results. I'll return later with some final comments before turning it over to you for questions.", "Michael K. Neborak", "Thank you, Dominic, and good day, everyone. During my comments, please refer to the slide presentation that is posted on our website. In reviewing the numbers, all comparisons are made to the third quarter 2012, unless otherwise stated. As noted in the first 2 earnings calls this year, the change in our remuneration policy from retention award amortization to bonus accrual distorts the comparison to prior periods expenses and therefore, to prior periods EPS and operating margin.", "This quarter, that difference was about $17 million or $0.07 per diluted share and 230 basis points of operating margin. I'll walk through those impacts as we go through the numbers. As Dominic mentioned, we continue to deliver solid underlying results in our seasonally smallest quarter, driven by 5.7% organic commission and fee growth. The published numbers on Slide 3 show adjusted operating income of $76 million and adjusted EPS of $0.19 per share, both down from the prospective figures last year. However, if you factor out the $17 million impact from changing our remuneration policy, our adjusted operating income would have increased by $11 million or 17% this quarter, and our adjusted operating margin would have increased by 100 basis points.", "Likewise, for adjusted EPS, if you factor out the $0.07 per share impact from changing our remuneration policy, that measure would have increased by $0.04 per share or 27%. Foreign exchange movements had no impact on our operating income and EPS figures this quarter. Revenues were negatively impacted by $4 million and expenses were positively impacted by the same amount, so a wash.", "Now let me explain our total expense growth in more detail on Slide 4. Underlying growth in total operating expenses was 7.6%. A like-for-like comparison of our expense base shows 4.9% growth after adjusting the third quarter 2012 for the change in remuneration policy.", "Let me now talk about what drove that growth. First, salaries and benefits. Slide 5 shows the quarterly impact from changing our remuneration policy. As we've discussed previously, our S&B expense for the full-year 2012 would have been $48 million higher had we been accruing for annual cash bonuses throughout 2012, the way we are doing it now, instead of amortizing retention awards. The impact this quarter was $17 million and you should note that there will be a $15 million impact on the fourth quarter comparison. After that, you should be happy to know that our 2014 compensation comparison will be on a consistent basis and you will not have to hear about terms like apples-to-apples, like-for-like and change in remuneration policy.", "Turning to Slide 6. You see that underlying salaries and benefits expense increased 8.4%. Fully, 360 basis points of that increase was due to the change in remuneration policy. On a like-for-like comparison, underlying S&B expense was up 4.8%. The main drivers of this growth were a combination of headcount levels that increased by about 3% since October 1, 2012, and the impact of annual salary increases.", "I also want to point out that the $17 million compensation difference had a more negative impact on the reported margins in Global and International. In the case of Global, 490 of the 780 basis point decline in the operating margin relates to the change in remuneration policy. The remaining decline is mostly due to headcount additions in reinsurance, placement and compliance. Plus, there were some acquired expenses from a small acquisition that closed in June.", "International's reported margins, which increased by 30 basis points, was negatively impacted by 280 basis points as a result of the change in remuneration policy.", "Slide 7 shows a quarterly comparison of other operating expenses. On an adjusted underlying basis, these expenses grew 6.7% in the quarter. That growth was driven primarily by higher professional fees and business development expenses.", "Before I move on to discuss taxes, let me first spend a moment discussing our debt management activity in the quarter. It was a busy quarter in that regard and in my view, a very successful one. As I mentioned on our last call, we amended our credit facility, we pushed out the maturity on our term loan and revolver to July 2018, and we also increased the size of our revolver from $500 million to $800 million, which simply provides us with more financial flexibility.", "During the quarter, we also issued $525 million of Senior Notes, $275 million with a 30-year maturity and $250 million with a 10-year maturity. We used the proceeds from those notes to buy back $521 million of our outstanding 2015, '17 and '19 maturities through a tender offer. In conjunction with this activity, the company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $60 million. We also recorded a $1 million expense for tender-related fees within our other operating expense line. Those charges were adjusted out of our reported results in calculating our adjusted EPS and adjusted margins.", "In summary, those actions increased the weighted average maturity of our debt by 4 years, while reducing the weighted average debt cost by approximately 20 basis points. So for the cost of executing this transaction today, we get lots of benefits way out into the future.", "Moving on to taxes. As I'm sure you've noted, the reported tax rate this quarter is highly unusual as we reported $11 million of tax expense on a pretax loss of $15 million. This requires a bit of explanation.", "Over the previous 2 quarters, we've discussed that our U.S. operations are in a cumulative 3-year loss position due to the charges in goodwill impairment we recorded dating back to 2011. We also mentioned that U.S. GAAP requires us to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and that very little tax charge will be booked against our U.S. income. We also cannot record any tax benefits against U.S. net losses.", "Since the debt we redeemed during the quarter was outstanding in the U.S., the charge was recorded there. The result was that our U.S. operations had a significant loss in the quarter and the tax benefit cannot be recorded until we move out of the cumulative 3-year loss position. When looking at the quarter's results on an adjusted basis, meaning, excluding the debt extinguishment charges, the adjusted tax rate is about 24%, which is in line with our expectations for the quarter.", "Moving now to the Associates line. Third quarter of 2013 showed a loss of $1 million compared to a loss of $2 million in the year-ago quarter. For the full-year 2013, we still expect the Associates line to be a loss of $1 million to $3 million, as Gras Savoye completes its operational review. As a result, we expect the Associates line in the fourth quarter will be a loss of $12 million to $14 million.", "Let me wrap up with some comments on the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $623 million of cash, up $120 million from June 30. Although the third quarter is our seasonally smallest quarter for net income, cash generation is typically strong due to collections of receivables. Our cash balance also benefited from other positive units in working capital and the close out of 2 in-the-money derivative instruments. We settled the interest rates swap attached to the 2015 bonds that were redeemed this quarter and we settled the treasury rate lock that was purchased in June ahead of the tender and refinancing transactions we completed during early August.", "Finally, we benefited from proceeds received during the quarter from employee stock option exercises. On this point, we are closely monitoring the amount of share dilution resulting from employee option grants. Going forward, we will consider repurchasing shares from time to time to offset that shareholder dilution.", "I think that is very much in line with what we told you in July at our investor conference when we said that we would use our cash in ways that we believe are in the best interest of our shareholders.", "And finally, total debt on our balance sheet at September 30 was about $2.3 billion, down slightly from year-end and at quarter end, our $800 million revolver was undrawn.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Dominic.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Thanks, Mike. At our investor conference, we laid out our strategic vision that we believe will allow us to grow revenues, drive operating leverage and increase cash flow. We discussed where we would compete and how we would compete. In our discussions about how we would compete, we told you we want to innovate, to ensure we are bringing the best solutions to our clients; invest selectively in new talent, better technology and M&A where we see the appropriate opportunity; and connect all of Willis to make it much easier for associates to bring all of the firm to our clients.", "Touching on that connectivity point, let me tell you what we've been doing since that investor conference. We know the value of working together across Willis and our clients expect and deserve that from us. To help deliver this, we have started making changes to our management structure that will make it easier for Willis Associates to work as one team to serve clients better and thereby, drive more cross-selling.", "In that context, we've introduced new global industry roles and new global product role, which we described in detail in our press release of October 24. These leaders will work with existing geographical, regional and office heads to make sure that we provide the full range of products and solutions to all clients in every industry around the world.", "All of us at Willis want to improve our value proposition to clients by delivering the full range of Willis' global industry and risk expertise locally. Willis is at its most compelling and is most successful when we combine our local teams in the country with our global specialist expertise. The organizational changes we are making will go a long way to ensure that we achieve this across our entire business around the world and that is very exciting for all of us. We will now be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Thomas Mitchell of Miller Tabak, you may ask your question.", "Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division", "We've been looking at things on an adjusted basis, which I think is correct. There's no reason not to look at things on an apples-to-apples basis. If we look at your revenues per share and go back to 2011, because the third quarter of 2012 was borderline miserable, your growth in revenues per share has been very, very modest over the last 8 quarters. So, I guess what I'm wondering is, is there reason to expect that the differentiation between revenue growth and expense growth from here will expand so that the operating leverage that you can get out of it falls through to the bottom line on a per-share basis a little more quickly?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "It's a reasonable question. Look, we are focused on delivering cash flow to our shareholders through a combination of revenue growth and some margin expansion, which we described in our investor conference. As you know, no one in the business are providing quarter-by-quarter or year-by-year projections or guidance, but the general direction of what we're trying to do was lay it out very clearly in the investor conference. So we will absolutely be focused on making sure that we deliver that cash flow to shareholders on a growing basis.", "Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division", "And separately, I'm just wondering a little bit whether the expense growth that you saw in the quarter is something that we should continue to expect, that there's, again, the underlying expense growth, apples-to-apples or whether or not there were factors that made it a little bit more expensive or there was more investment in people and capabilities than we would expect on a -- going forward in other quarters?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Well, I think my answer is going to be a same again, which is -- and as we described at the investor conference, Willis is very much a global company. You heard about some of the growth rates we are finding and achieving in some of our markets. As investors, you would want us to be investing behind our growth opportunities. So when we are seeing double-digit revenue growth opportunities or high, very single digit revenue growth opportunities on a continuing basis in many of our markets, we, of course, will be hiring behind those. We have to balance that with productivity improvements elsewhere and thinking very carefully about some markets, which we may not want to invest behind so much or even exit, as you heard we've done in the small way in England in this quarter. So it will be a balance, but let me be clear, where we see sustained revenue growth with good margin opportunities, we are going to add people and invest behind them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just wanted to get some color from you guys on the pricing dynamic in the P&C marketplace. You can sort of answer in any way you see fit, whether by line, by geography, all of the above or all in kind of numbers, however you think it makes sense to analyze.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "As you know, we've issued a number of reviews publicly about what we think is going on in the market, but let me turn it over to Steve Hearn who can provide us with a bit of an overview of what we see going on. Steve?", "Steven P. Hearn", "Thanks, Dominic. Greg, I'll try and to do all of the above in terms of comment. I think it's a particularly interesting time in terms of rate both in reinsurance and insurance as the industry works through the impact of what's been a relatively quiet claims period, impact of the so-called new capital and programs such as our own Global 360. So if I start perhaps with reinsurance, I think what we see at the moment and for the immediate future, I'll break it down through the 3 business units that we operate. Firstly our Specialty Reinsurance business, where as I think you know, we're the market leader. With a couple of exceptions, we see these rates down, say 5% or so. A couple of exceptions, aerospace, reinsurance we'd see it down more, perhaps 10%, on occasion, even more. In our Marine Reinsurance business, which we would see as largely flat, which is really reflecting the loss experience in that class. And secondly, in reinsurance, we look at our international reinsurance book and we'd see that as probably about 5% down on a risk-adjusted basis with a few, perhaps obvious exceptions like U.K. and French auto, which are up. And finally for reinsurance on North American business, here, we see probably cut down 20%, 25%, which we think is consistent with what we saw in the midyear renewals and casualty may be flat to down 5%, something like that. On the insurance side, again, I'll probably break it down to 3 ways to look at our business. Firstly, specialty insurance, which we'd see generally flat with again, maybe the exception in the Aerospace business, which we would see down by as much as 10% or even more, and upstream energy, which we would also see as down. Our International Insurance business, as you would understand, a very difficult one to generalize about, given the vast range of countries that Tim and his colleagues operate in. But I think we'd conclude that the general trend towards property rates coming off a bit and Worker's Comp continuing to trend upwards. And Willis North America, property and casualty up 2.5% to 5.5%, respectively, something like that. Human Capital and Personal Lines may be about 3.5%. Important and I say this each time I get a similar question on the earnings call, I think it's important to remind everybody that rate fluctuations don't necessarily bleed directly into our own earnings and with rates down people, sometimes by more, we certainly see that in reinsurance. And additionally, we've driven some very strong new business growth. So while the rate may be down on an expiring policy with somebody else, this is new income to us. And finally, of course, we have some income on a fee basis. So I hope that gives you some sort of the flavor of what we think is going on.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, that's an excellent answer. Very, very thorough. How should we be thinking about -- I mean, the reinsurance segment has done very well. Should we be worried about the earnings trajectory as pricing pulls in for that segment? Really it's an '14 and beyond kind of question. You guys are operating really well right now. It looks like another good quarter there.", "Steven P. Hearn", "It is, Greg, I'll take that one as well, Dominic, if I may. Yes, another great quarter out of Willis Re. Maybe people are getting tired or me saying that, I'm not getting tired saying it. I can tell you it's a great result. Largely driven, as we said, as Dominic said in his commentary, buying new business as well. So it's not by accident. This is very much sustaining business growth that's driving these numbers, as well as a good retention. Obviously the debate is around what happens in terms of property cap -- new capital whether that bleeds into other product classes or out of North America, which is largely where it's concentrated at the moment. That's one factor, which obviously is going to have some sort of impact on the reinsurance world. Again, I repeat, lower premiums don't necessarily mean lower earnings and we do find people buy more, particularly outside the larger reinsurance buyers when rates are coming down. There's been a lot of public comment around the larger reinsurance buyers retaining more, buying less reinsurance capacity. But again, that doesn't necessarily flow through in terms of the reinsurance intermediaries earnings because often, in fact always, you'll find reinsurance intermediary or 2, engaged in providing advice and modeling around that risk retention activity. So I think we feel very good about Willis Re, it continues to perform very well and, and particularly given its market share in a couple of jurisdictions, notably North America, we still anticipate good performance out of that business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So just maybe on the expenses lines. First off, on the comp side, on the salary and benefits side. Can you kind of break out the headcount increases versus the salary components? Is that possible?", "Michael K. Neborak", "So the headcount increases that I referred to is being roughly 3% over the last 12 months breakout, North America is essentially flat to up a little bit. International was between 4% and 4.5%. Global is up between 6% and 7%. So that's kind of split between reinsurance, placement and some of the other activities that Steve referred to. And then our corporate expenses headcount are up about 3%.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And so is that -- I mean, is that sort of part of the implied salary increases? And I mean, is that how we should be thinking about the way that you're looking at annual compensation cost for existing employees is that sort of 3-ish percent increase? .", "Dominic J. Casserley", "No, no, no. It's Dominic here. He was giving you the headcount increase here.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Oh, I see. So you -- yes, I'm more interested in the line items. So I'm trying to understand...", "Michael K. Neborak", "If you add to the headcount increases, basically what we call same-store merit salary increases, about 2%, across the board obviously. There's a lot of differentiation. Some people get 0, some people get more, but in average, it's about 2%. The 3% headcount increase over those, just trying to explain the expense growth of the third quarter plus that 2% gives you that 4.8%, 4.9% true expense growth in our S&B line that I referred to.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then on the other trends line [ph], I think the press release mentioned some business development and other costs. Is there any way that we can try and peel out some of those items just to understand kind of what's underneath?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Well, some of them were related to the investor conference, all the activity leading up to that in July and August. Some of it relates to some consulting expenses that we incurred as it -- to support that effort from the beginning of the year through July. So all the expenses really, of that nature.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then can you also walk through like the year-over-year change in the corporate line? That was a pretty substantial decline. I mean, there's a laundry list of things that are included there, but is there any way to kind of highlight the items that most impacted the year-over-year change?", "Michael K. Neborak", "The year-over-year change is mostly in the third quarter of 2012, we had a $12 million settlement for our India JV, so if you -- that was a onetime. The difference between the third quarter this year and last year is purely that charge that was there in the third quarter last year and not there in this quarter, 2013.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then last question just on Gras Savoye. I mean, can we get an update there. I mean, it sounds like you're expecting sort of similar number in the fourth quarter as previously. Any update there on the restructuring actions? Is there, in terms of improving profitability or on the leverage side given you may have taken some actions there? Anything as far as new debt actions that you might expect and any change to your potential option exercise in '16?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "So let me take the first or the last part of that and then hand over to Tim Wright just to give you an update on how the restructuring is going. Our position remains the same on we have to make a decision about whether we exercise our option in the spring of '15 and we would actually close the transaction in '16. We remain very interested in Gras Savoye of course. It's not often you get the opportunity to buy a leader in a major market, who also has a range of very exciting growth opportunities around Africa, the Middle East and bits of Asia and Eastern Europe. So we will look at the asset and it's also affirmed that we have known for many years, so we really understand how it works. Obviously, however, we have to keep an eye on how the major economies it works in our performing so that's why we're happy to have this option. And we're also interested in how it's performing on its underlying business. There are no specific debt changes we would expect related to this in the near future. So let me hand over to Tim just to give you an update on where we stand in the operation improvement.", "Timothy D. Wright", "Michael, on Gras Savoye, just a reminder, if we need to. This is a business that has very strong positions in the French market. It's the market leader. It's been somewhat challenged in recent years, a combination of the market environment and the need to restructure that business. There is a relatively new leadership team there and as we have discussed before, they are going through a process of restructuring that business, and that is going well. That takes time but it's going well. So there's nothing new to report on that. And also, the restructuring, I should stress, is both operational to help with the cost side of the equation, but it's also focused on driving growth, both in France and in their international operations.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Klauber of William Blair.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "A couple of questions on the health care exchanges. Great to see you're gaining traction. Could you give us an idea of how many lives you think you'll have by the end of the year for the selling season, number one? Number two, could you give us an idea, I guess, how much of the interest level building at your clients? And then number 3 is how are the brokers doing selling? It's sort of a new proposition for them, are they ramping up on it?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "So let me -- I'm going to turn over to Todd, but I think the overall message we have here is we took our time to enter this market because we wanted to really understand it. We didn't rush in. And as I said, we only launched our discussions in May and we have taken a very deliberate approach both around having it as part of our overall objective package of offerings that we have for our clients so that we can enter into a full consultative discussion with them. But we're excited about both the level of debates we're having and these specific opportunities around the private exchange that are emerging. So that's been our posture. So let me hand over to Todd to give you some more detail on trends and how the dialogue with the clients is going.", "Todd Jones", "So obviously, it's very difficult for us to forecast how many lives we're going to have on this thing going forward, but as we have future calls and can give future updates on the performance of our exchange and the trends we're seeing, we'll certainly do that. And that's probably good segue into your second comment about interest, which has been sort of going back to Dominic's prepared comments, it has been overwhelming in terms of the interest of our client base and prospective clients on just trying to understand the dynamics of the exchange marketplace, both the public and private exchange marketplace, understanding their position around a defined contribution model and how that works going forward. So it's provided a great platform for us to go out and meet with clients and prospects, talking about that, but as well as our other offerings within Human Capital. And finally, your last question, which is a really good one on how were they doing with sort of selling this. And as Dominic mentioned, we rolled this out in May and we spent a good part of the summer sort of educating and training our Human Capital professionals on not only the offering, but what's going on in the marketplace, et cetera, which was a big shift for us in terms of training. I think like anything, the more comfortable you become with the subject and the repetitive conversations that are happening with clients and prospects, you just get more comfortable in selling the concept. All along, our goal was to be sort of an objective advisor in this process, not pushing people to one solution, but providing sort of a range of options and looking at it in terms of their risk profile, their relationship with their employee base and how they want to manage that going forward. So all in all, we've been really encouraged by the progress that we've been making and the work that we've done in that space.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And one follow-up on Human Capital. I've heard that commissions for middle-market health-insurance, generally, there's been a moderate pressure in commissions, but you're still growing. So does that mean you've able to take market share in that area?", "Todd Jones", "Adam, it's Todd again. I think to answer your question, yes. I think we are taking market share in that regard. And I don't know if we've seen necessarily, the downward pressure on commission rates that you're referencing. Obviously, compensation is a bit of a fluid issue in that space, but I think as I look at the trends in that market that we play in, I would look at the growth as definitely gaining market share.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Two outlook questions, if I can. One, is it too early to know or to expect full year operating profits for Gras Savoye in 2014?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Tim, do you want to answer that question?", "Timothy D. Wright", "As you know, we provide some guidance, which we've done in terms of the fourth quarter. All I'd say about 2014 is that we are on track in terms of our medium-term plans with Gras Savoye.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And similar question and hopefully, this doesn't contravene your approach to guidance. Corporate segment operating income, is there any sort of underlying run rate that we can assume?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Well, the corporate segment, just let me step back, Meyer, and just tell you what's in that corporate segment again. So we have the intangible amortization in that segment. So that's the only line that is pretty fixed, because we know schedules, so we know what that number is going to be every quarter. And then we have other things related to foreign exchange hedging and some valuation, revaluation foreign exchange on our balance sheet, which runs through there. So those items are pretty unpredictable. So therefore, it jumps around a lot. So if you go back to the intangible amortization, that's about $14 million a quarter, it comes down slightly as you go out, but that's the number that's set. And then everything else revolves around foreign exchange and then to the extent that we have some special charges, for, example, that's the line where we took our operational review charges back in the first quarter this year, that's the line where we took the goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of last year. So all those kind of one-off items typically get booked into there. And also, in the third quarter of 2012, as I mentioned, the settlement that we had to get out of our India JV was recorded to that line. So it's very difficult to predict the real run rate other than that $14 million of intangible amortization that runs through it every quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A couple of questions. The first is, fourth quarter 2012, it looked like Global had a pretty big jump in organic growth. And as I recall, there were some unusual items. Can you talk about what the comparison looks like this year fourth quarter versus last year fourth quarter in that segment?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Capital Markets is the -- actually, Capital Markets is fundamentally the answer to your question. They had a significant Q4 last year. You know the nature of that business very well, it's lumpy and unpredictable but significant when it comes home. And certainly, we have a very active pipeline and active engagements at the moment. Whether they close in Q4 or not is obviously, yet to be determined.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you remind us what the sort of overage was in that quarter? Was there any unusually large transactions, any numbers behind that?", "Michael K. Neborak", "So Jay, in the quarter there, it was lots of transactions. I think the largest one that got recorded was about a $3 million, $3.5 million fee. So I think in total, the revenues were somewhere in the $10 million to $15 million range.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "I think north of that but yes, it was -- I guess what you're looking for is was it a 1 item that drove it, it wasn't. It was a pipeline that actually looks very similar to the pipeline we're looking at, at the moment.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. Second question on health care exchanges. Obviously, other companies have jumped into this a bit earlier than you and they made significant investments as they ramped up their capabilities for this product. You're obviously wading a little bit slower than some others. Is there still a material amount of investment that you have to make to be competitive with say, the Aons of the world which has put a lot of money into this?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "You're right, we did think very carefully about this, both making sure we got our market positioning right. For our target client base, we want to make sure we were providing the exact right market positioning and the products that would work. We can't comment on others' investments, but our investment was in a controlled way. And we do not, at the moment, envision significant additional investment beyond what we've already spent. Now the market might change, things might evolve, but at the moment, we're comfortable where we are, that we have a highly competitive product for the market segment we are targeting.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens Incorporated.", "John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "This is John Campbell in for Brett Huff. You guys mentioned some delayed revs in International last quarter and it does sound like that helped Australasia result in 3Q. But can you guys just maybe just pinpoint how much of that rev rolled over from 2Q and then maybe just to what extent, if any at all, that additional rev benefited margins?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Tim, do you want to take the Australia question?", "Timothy D. Wright", "Australia is just, again, a bit of context Australasia, Australia in particular, was in that first category I talked about at the investor conference of turnaround. And the performance you saw in the quarter was a combination of some positive timing that came out of Q2 that I think we talked about in the Q2 call and also, underlying growth. But that they -- I would say, the mix of that was pretty balanced. So it's not just one piece of timing that's driving growth there, it's a combination and we're actually seeing improved, new business wins and high retention, so -- and in terms of the margin, yes, that did drop through to the margin in Australasia in the quarter.", "John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So I guess it's fair to say it was just a small amount of rev coming over from 2Q?", "Timothy D. Wright", "As I say, the uplift we saw was a consequence of the 2 things but we had growth in the quarter in excess of 10% and the key point, I think, is that only part of that was the result of the change in business. It was timing, it wasn't revenue recognition, it was business that normally would've been in Q2 that moved into Q3. But we're still seeing good underlying growth, which is great to see in a business that hasn't had that for some time.", "John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Great, and just as a follow-up, is there a particular leverage ratio you guys are kind of setting out as a medium-term or near-term goal?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "It's Dominic here. No. We have stated in the investor conference that we believe being an investment-grade company is very important to us and that we are going to manage our growth agenda within that context. We have no desire beyond that. We're making sure that our balance sheet meets the needs of being an investment-grade company and we obviously are in dialogue with our lenders in that context and that we can execute our growth agenda.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Mewhirter, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Douglas Mewhirter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "I was trying to I guess, follow-up on the rate movements in North America and the P&C. Have you seen, I guess, a disruption or maybe a little more sustainability to positive rate movements from the recent troubles that some small or midsize companies like Tower Group and Meadowbrook or do you think that there's still -- the supply and demand is starting to balance out?", "Steven P. Hearn", "No. It's Steve again, Doug. No, I think probably more relevant is the larger debate around capital arriving in the reinsurance world is impact on the primary markets, those types of things that are driving probably as much as anything, an attitudinal view of what's going on for a rate perspective. Added to which as I said earlier, the relatively benign claims period that we're experiencing. So I think those are probably more material to what's happening in the rates.", "Douglas Mewhirter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "So just to -- just so I understand your answer, you're saying that actually, the increase or the I guess, the increased cheapness of reinsurance is actually putting pressure on the primary market, you're actually seeing that filter in?", "Steven P. Hearn", "We are, certainly in some parts of the world, yes. But again, I think it's more about attitude than actual reality of what's happening. I think there's an awareness of reinsurance rating that's out there that's driving a primary insurance view of rate rather than the absolute reinsurance capacity that's being deployed. Does that make sense?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Could you give us a bit more insight to the Willis 360 program in terms of what that could mean for top line and margins in future years?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "We've developed the 360 with great care. We did not jump into this opportunity but instead, thought about it very carefully and talked to lots of people to come up with a proposition, which we think is critically is good for our clients on a sustainable basis, which was the criteria we had to use. Let me turn over to Steve who's been heavily involved in this talk through, how that's been developed.", "Steven P. Hearn", "I think the short answer to your question is it's too early to determine the impact on our bottom line or our top line, for that matter. But let me give you a little bit more color of what we've been doing and where we are and why we're excited about this new initiative. As Dominic said, we've been very thoughtful in our approach here with an overarching objective of trying to provide something that's going to be sustainable, better outcomes for our clients, not just a quick reaction or a quick turn, but something that's sustainable. We've been very public about what we've been doing and public over an extended period, talking to capacity providers far and wide. Over 40 organizations have engaged with us on the subject and I think I'd describe the outcome at the moment in terms of what we've announced we're launching really, in 3 areas. Firstly, what I described as traditional providers who are looking to provide additional capacity or diversify from a product line perspective; secondly, reinsurers who themselves are looking to diversify and perhaps move up the chain; and finally, what I describe as emergent capacity such as that coming out of places like China. I'd say we see this as more of an a evolution than a revolution in terms of what's going on here. Our motivation has been very much about the client and I think my answer to your question probably is that if we do that and maintain the client focus, we'll sell more insurance and we'll retain more business, and that should benefit our shareholders as well as our clients as we move forward, that's certainly our plan. But it's very early days.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Separate issue, the Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in the Stanford Financial litigation. I was hoping you can provide your updated perspective on the potential outcome of that case and whether you have any reserves established against it.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "It's Dominic here. As we have said before, we were pleased that the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. The Court, remember, is addressing a technical legal issue that was only the first of many legal issues we pointed out to the trial court. If we win at the Supreme Court, obviously, we will be delighted. But everyone should understand that if we \"lose\" that review, there are a host of additional legal issues that will still need to be addressed by the district court. In other words, the case will be at much the same posture as it was 4 years ago and we continue to be ready to fight the allegations case every step of the way. So that's our view on that.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, and are there any reserves established against it currently?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "No.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Darren Marcus of MKM Partners.", "Darren Marcus - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "So I was just curios to get some more color on the healthcare exchange product that you guys have. For example, is it fully insured versus self-insured, how many carriers do you have on the exchange and do you guys have a retiree product or is it just an active exchange product?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Let me have Todd give you a bit more detail on the Willis Advantage exchange.", "Todd Jones", "So Darren, let me -- I tried to jot down your questions, let me know if I miss any. So it is a single carrier product for active employees only. So we're not looking to attack the retiree market. And there was one other question you had in there that I think I'd missed.", "Darren Marcus - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division", "Just how many -- so how many carriers have you got -- fully insured versus self-insured, I'm sorry.", "Todd Jones", "I'm sorry, so fully insured, single carrier, active.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of ones here. First, I'm curious, could you give us some insight as to what you think is going to go on with Western Europe. You're at flat right now, kind of what's your read is, are things picking up at all for you guys?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Brian, I'm happy to give you perspective but I'm actually going to be even happier to allow Tim to do that. He spends his time really focused on the detail of that. I can tell you before we start, he's going to give you a \"it's complicated\", but Tim?", "Timothy D. Wright", "Brian, it's complicated. Obviously, Europe is a very big business for us, it's about 40% of International revenues as you know, and it comprises many different markets and they vary considerably. So from quarter-to-quarter and from country to country, you'll see quite a lot of movement. But in terms of general themes, Europe is obviously in a macroeconomic sense, in a better shape than it was in a few years ago. We would not be the only people to observe that. In terms of our business, we expect to continue to take share by growing in low-single digits and maybe moving that up to mid-single digits. That's our anticipation but that's going to be a result of a combination of lots of ups and downs and variations from country to country, which are not entirely driven by the macroeconomic environment. It depends on segments we compete in, the businesses that we have, et cetera. But as I said at the investor conference, we're confident that we can continue to take share in a flat to low growth environment in Europe through innovation and the things I described in the investor conference.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And then one for Mike. Mike, is there any early read you can give us on what your pension expense and the pension funding may look like in 2014 given where we are with interest rates?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Yes, that's a great question. We don't do that analysis 'til here in the fourth quarter, so I don't have a read for 2014. But I'll just remind you of one thing, we have an agreement with the trustees, which comes up for renewal at the end of this year. It usually takes quite a while to negotiate that. And so for the near term in 2014, we'll be kind of paying into the funding agreement that existed at the end of 2010 until this one gets renegotiated.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And then just lastly, any chance you've got free cash flow for the quarter and just a quick request, is it possible to get a cash flow statement with your earnings release going forward, given that cash flow is now kind of an important metric for you?", "Michael K. Neborak", "That's our goal and at some point during 2014, I hope we'll be able to do that. Today, the reason, basic reason why we don't do it is because we have a cash flow statement. To be quite honest, sometimes it's very difficult to find out the reason for movements and to provide the cash flow statement without being able to explain to you the reasons for movements doesn't seem to be very productive. So the goal is to have that sometime during 2014.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I'm sorry about all the exchange questions but it's a hot topic right now. Can you talk a little bit about 3 years ago, 2 years ago, a client of yours wanted some help with their health care benefits, how you guys would get paid for just servicing that need and in an exchange world, how you get paid going forward?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "We'll do the 2 years back first and then talk about the private exchange, how we're getting paid for that. Todd, do you want to take that?", "Todd Jones", "Yes. Josh, effectively, our compensation will work in a very similar manner today as it did 2, 3 years ago. We get paid commissions or fees to consult on a placement or a transaction. And doing that transaction, we could also earn additional income out of the sale of ancillary products beyond just the health and welfare products that we would normally transact. So I think if you're trying to get your head around migrating from sort of 1 mile to the other in terms of how we feel about our compensation, the near term, we feel the same in terms of how were comp'd historical levels to future levels. I think the one thing we are excited about is the opportunity to sell additional products and services in through that exchange platform that don't necessarily currently exist today. So we see it as a terrific opportunity going forward.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And to the extent under the exchange -- will your compensation be at all dis-intermediated by having a paid liaison a part of it?", "Todd Jones", "No. We've essentially taken that into account in terms of that relationship in order to deal with any cost relative to the platform.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital Markets.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "What is the Gras Savoye restructuring charges that are running through current year numbers that may not be existing next year? It looks like you're projecting Q4 to be down severely versus the year ago, which I suspect has charges even though the full year number is coming in, in line with earlier guidance?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Bob, this is Mike here. So for first 3 quarters of the year, very little charges have come through. We're anticipating the charges really to come through in the fourth quarter and Q1 in 2014, potentially.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So any just general comments on what the underlying earnings are doing in that business x charges? Is it sort of running at break even and you're making investments that will lead to profits or...", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Tim, do you want to -- it's Dominic. Tim should talk about that but first thing we should understand, this is still a profitable business. This restructuring is about making it more profitable. Tim?", "Timothy D. Wright", "Yes. I mean the business is making money on an underlying basis. I'm sure the aspiration is that it can make more over time and that's the reason for the restructuring. But as I said, there is a medium-term plan. The shareholders of Gras Savoye are including with it, have agreed and they're heading in the right direction. So very -- I would just say as a gloss, it's a very positive development of the business. We feel very good about what the leadership team at Gras Savoye are doing.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Maybe I'm missing something, but it's -- you're not reporting much in profits and equity in Associates. Are there other losses that are dwarfing the profits that Gras Savoye is doing or is there acquisition accounting or...", "Michael K. Neborak", "Well, there's other associates that we have included in that line item. Gras Savoye is the largest but there are other relatively large ones as well, not anywhere near the size of Gras Savoye. And that line item is a combination of their operating income that they have plus they have some debt that they owe to us and so it's pretty complicated when you factor in all that pieces and trying to dissect it where we present it in a consolidated form back to Gras Savoye. Bob just can't do that.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, last question. If we multiply the 20 bps of interest savings and the $2.3 billion, is that the right base to get $4 million of annual interest savings pretax?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Well I think -- I don't think you can get $4 million from where we are today. So for example, in the third quarter, we booked $30 million of interest expense. I think the number going forward is going to be closer to $31 million. There were some adjustments around the refinancing this quarter. The number had been about $32 million -- $32 million to $33 million earlier in the year. So I would look at $31 million, $31-plus million going forward.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Maybe I missed something. What you said you're going to save 20 basis points on the change? Did I miss or get the wrong number?", "Michael K. Neborak", "No, I said that we reduced the effective cost of the portfolio of debt that we have outstanding by about 20 basis points from the actions that we took to refinance all these notes that we tendered for.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "So you're saving 20 basis points on $2.3 billion of debt, is that the right basis that we should apply the savings to?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Yes, but then there's amortization. For example, all the costs that we had to set up the bank facility, the cost that we had in terms of the discount on the bonds for the underwriters and the other costs get capitalized and they'd get amortization against what I just described there. So you might see what you're -- the math that you're doing, you're not going to see it display that way on our financial statements.", "Operator", "At this time, we have no further questions.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Thank you very much, everybody, for your questions. We really appreciate them and your interest in Willis. And we look forward to talking to you again about the year end.

Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Aida Sukys. Please proceed.", "Aida Sukys", "Thank you. Good morning. This is Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations at Towers Watson. Welcome to the Towers Watson Earnings Call. I'm here today with John Haley, Towers Watson's Chief Executive Officer; and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please refer to our website for this morning's press release. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay via telephone for the next 2 weeks by dialing (617) 801-6888, confirmation number 80879673. The replay will also be available for the next 3 months on our website.", "This call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, that involve risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of forward-looking statements and the risks and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking results, investors should review the Forward-Looking Statements section of the earnings press release issued this morning, a copy of which is available on our website at www.towerswatson.com, as well as other disclosures under the heading of Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC.

For a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures under Regulation G to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release and the accompanying financial tables we posted this morning. After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions.", "Now I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John J. Haley", "Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll review our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "These results, the prior year results, and fiscal year '14 guidance reflect the divestiture of our Brokerage business. The Brokerage business has been reported as discontinued operations in our current financial statements. Reviewing the company as a whole, including the discontinued Brokerage operations, our financial results, revenues, adjusted EPS and margins, were at or slightly ahead of our guidance for the quarter. The Brokerage business was officially sold yesterday, November 6.", "Reported revenues for the quarter were $810 million, an increase of 2% over the prior-year first quarter reported revenues and up 3% on an organic basis. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 3%. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. Had Brokerage not been classified as discontinued operations in the first quarter, revenues would have been $851 million.", "Our EBITDA for the quarter was $146 million, or 18.0% of revenues. The prior year first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $139 million, or 17.5% of revenues. We no longer have adjustments to EBITDA. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.24, up 51%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.51, up 34%.", "We're pleased with the overall results this quarter and the focus of our associates and business leaders on the market, while managing several key company initiatives. We took steps this past quarter to streamline resources, structure and processes to strengthen our long-term growth prospects. Resource alignment continued in the RCS business in EMEA, with a specific focus on the U.K. We announced the sale of our Brokerage business and we finalized preparations for our initial OneExchange enrollment season. We're excited about the framework we have developed for growth, profitability and continuing to provide market-leading solutions that build value for our clients.", "Now let's look at the performance of each of our segments. On an organic basis, Benefits was flat, Risk and Financial Services decreased by 4%, Talent and Rewards grew 11% and Exchange Solutions grew 154%. For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $457 million. As forecasted, Benefit segment revenues were flat on a constant currency basis. Retirement revenues decreased by 2% on a constant currency basis. Bulk lump sum projects were at their peak in the first and second quarters of fiscal '13, making the year-over-year comparables challenging. While we continue to perform bulk lump sum work, revenue levels will not approach the level we experienced in the first half of fiscal year '13.", "Health and Group Benefits revenues grew 3% on a constant currency basis. We continued to deploy resources to prepare for the OneExchange enrollment period. We expect the redeployment of these resources to continue in some manner for the rest of the fiscal year. However, we anticipate a shift in focus from being weighted at the operations level to more of a marketing focus.", "Technology and Administration Solutions revenues increased by 6% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to new client work in EMEA and the Americas.", "The OneExchange active selling season for 2015 is already in full swing. We typically see employers waiting until after the annual enrollment period to start contemplating the following year's enrollment process. However, we're already being asked to attend prospect and client meetings, seeing a steady stream of RFPs and talking with our current administration and Retiree exchange clients.", "We're also very pleased with how the enrollment process is progressing and feel very confident in being able to scale this technology for anticipated growth in 2015. We're very excited about the success of the enrollment process as we, at Towers Watson, are also living the experience as participants. While Retirement will experience challenging comparables in the next quarter, we anticipate that the Benefits segment should show modest growth for the full year.", "Now let me turn to Risk and Financial Services. For the quarter, the Risk and Financial Services segment, excluding our Brokerage business, had revenues of $142 million as compared to $150 million for the first quarter of fiscal '13. Revenues were down 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by a decrease in Risk Consulting and Software revenue. Risk Consulting and Software revenue declined by 12% on a constant currency basis. Globally, client demand for discretionary projects continues to be low. We started restructuring efforts last fiscal year and are continuing to take action this fiscal year.", "Investment had 11% constant currency growth, led by the Americas. All regions experienced growth this quarter. We continue to feel confident that the investment business will produce strong results in the long term. However, the revenue growth percentages may be challenging for the second and third quarters due to a significant onetime project in fiscal year '13. We anticipate discretionary spending continuing to affect the Risk Consulting and Software line of business this fiscal year. However, we see the investment business continuing to deliver strong results.", "Next, let's move on to Talent and Rewards. For the quarter, the Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $154 million, with revenues up 11% on a constant currency basis. Data Surveys and Technology revenues increased by 17% on a constant currency basis as demand for software implementations continues to increase significantly and demand for employee engagement surveys has resumed after a decline in the prior fiscal year.", "Reward Talent and Communication revenues increased by 7% on a constant currency basis due to a pickup in demand for general compensation work, sales of new health-care reform education kits and customized benefits communication work as organizations explain their programs in light of health-care reform.", "Executive Compensation revenues were up 7% on a constant currency basis. The Americas region led growth for the line of business, a refined marketing strategy resulted in new industry wins. We expect the Data Surveys and Technology will be the main driver for growth in this segment this fiscal year, but we're generally seeing some positive momentum in all lines of business in this segment.", "And last, I'd like to move to the Exchange Solutions segment. For the quarter, the Exchange Solutions segment had revenues of $35 million, an increase of 154% on a constant currency basis. Due to GAAP purchase accounting rules, approximately $6 million of deferred revenues were not recognized in the first quarter of FY'13.", "As we mentioned last quarter, we completed another very successful selling season for the annual enrollment process, which typically occurs between October and December. However, we're seeing an extended selling season, as organizations are considering off-cycle enrollments. The off-cycle enrollments have increased steadily for a fourth year in a row. We've actually won 12 new off-cycle clients since our last call. This won't have a material impact on FY '14 financial results, but, ultimately, a steady increase of off-cycle enrollments would help level out the seasonality of the business.", "In general, the enrollment process is going very smoothly. We've seen progress with the streamlining efforts we've put into place this enrollment season. We've enrolled 15% more members in the same time frame as last year.", "We have a small number of Access clients. This is the group of employees we help direct to the public exchanges. We'll be ready to assist these clients as soon as the federal government exchanges are operational. The delay with the government exchanges has no material impact on our FY '14 financial results. We continue to be pleased with the long-term prospects for Exchange Solutions.", "In conclusion, we've had a solid first quarter and we've laid the groundwork for strong long-term growth. While we're excited about the future, I'd be remiss in not taking a moment to look back. I'd like to acknowledge the Brokerage associates for their commitment and great work over the years and wish them all do best. They leave behind a strong legacy.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger F. Millay", "Thanks, John. And good morning to everyone. I'd also like to add that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Now let's turn to the financial overview.", "As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and accounting -- or merger and acquisition accounting costs. Also, per GAAP accounting rules, we moved the revenue and operating expenses related to the Brokerage business to discontinued operations in the first quarter as a result of the sale announcement.", "Given the complications of these movements in our statement of earnings, I'd like to reiterate what John said. We're pleased with the results and the total company results for revenues, margins and adjusted EPS came in at or above the guidance we provided at Analyst Day.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had a 30% NOI margin. Risk and Financial Services, excluding the Brokerage line of business, had a 16% NOI margin. Continued Risk Consulting and Software revenue pressure impacted the margin. Talent and Rewards had a 29% NOI margin. Exchange Solutions had an 18% NOI margin in what is typically a seasonally softer quarter for them. The first quarter results do not indicate a change in the overall trend of softer first-half margins for Exchange Solutions.", "Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter was $88 million. Adjusted net income was $107 million. The tax rate for continuing operations for the quarter was 15% as compared to our guided rate of 24%. The tax rate was impacted by a $6 million more favorable outcome than anticipated and the onetime tax benefits from resolved tax examination items, plus the benefit of reducing U.K. deferred taxes down to the new statutory rate.", "Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. At September 30, we have $358 million in cash available for our use. For the first quarter of fiscal '14, our free cash outflow was $178 million as compared to an outflow of $202 million for the first quarter of fiscal '13. Favorable client receivables drove the year-over-year change. As a reminder, the first quarter of the fiscal year is seasonally a heavy period of cash use for the company due to the payment of discretionary bonuses. Free cash flow generally improves through each consecutive quarter.", "We have $30 million of borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter as a result of the bonus payments. This quarter, we began paying down our $250 million term loan, which was used to fund the Extend Health purchase. The term loan amortizes at a rate of $6.25 million per quarter, with a final maturity date of June 1, 2017.", "During this quarter, we didn't repurchase any shares. We planned for about $75 million of share repurchases over the rest of this fiscal year. The general authorization has a remaining balance of $120 million.", "As a result of this sale of the Brokerage business, we've updated our fiscal year guidance. Overall, we expect revenues to be approximately $3.53 billion. The adjusted revenue guidance takes into consideration the reduction of roughly $170 million of Brokerage revenues. We expect our second quarter fiscal '14 revenue to be roughly comparable to second quarter fiscal '13, due to the very strong results last year driven by bulk lump sum activity and significant recovery of receivable reserves.", "We're expecting our fiscal '14 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be within the range of $5.75 to $5.82. This excludes the potential gain on sale we expect to realize from the sale of the Brokerage business in the second quarter. We expect our EBITDA margin for the year to be within the range of 19.0% to 19.5%. This guidance includes severance and restructuring costs of around $10 million for aligning the Risk Consulting and Software business to market demand and adjusting corporate overhead to account for the divestiture of the Brokerage business. We believe that the second quarter will be the heaviest for the impact of these restructuring costs.", "We expect the fiscal '14 income tax rate to be around 31%. This rate includes $21 million of first quarter benefits from resolved tax examinations and the lower U.K. statutory rate. This estimated range does not include potential tax examinations or other items that could settle in the third or fourth quarters of this fiscal year.", "For the fiscal year, our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of USD 1.58 to the British pound and an average exchange rate of USD 1.35 to the euro. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $71 million, GAAP diluted earnings per share will continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share.", "Now we'll review our fiscal year guidance for the segments. We expect constant currency revenue growth in the low single digits in the Benefits segment. While the business performance continues to be solid, the strong fiscal '13 growth in the Retirement business continues to be an inhibitor to delivering top line growth this fiscal year. The NOI margin for Benefits is expected to be in the low- to mid-30% range.", "Next in the Risk and Financial Services segment. We expect constant currency revenue to decline by low- to mid-single digits. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low-20%. We expect margins to increase during the year as Risk Consulting and Services realizes the benefit of steps it has and continues to make to realign their business to reflect the current marketplace.", "In the Talent and Reward segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. While they have a difficult comparable in the second quarter, as a result of the receivable reserves recoveries last year, we continue to feel good about their underlying business momentum for the year. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low- to mid-20% range.", "Lastly, in the Exchange Solutions segment, we expect revenue growth of around 65% and we expect the NOI margin to be in the low- to mid-20% range. As a reminder, the Exchange Solutions profitability is seasonally low in the first half of the fiscal year. The first quarter was not indicative of a change in trend.", "I'd like to conclude by saying that we had a strong quarter and I'm very excited about our long-term growth prospects. I also want to add my thanks to the Brokerage associates and wish them much success. Now I'll turn it back to John.", "John J. Haley", "Thanks, Roger. And now we'd be glad to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "First question on the Exchange Solutions on net operating NOI range. It's up to low- to mid-20s from low-20% at the guidance at the Analyst Day. It looks like that could be being driven by the margin this quarter being higher than what I expected. I mean, are you guys just kind of ahead of plan to getting this division to kind of one of the highest at the company or what's driving the beat this quarter in the change to guidance?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I think that the big thing there was they had a more productive setup for the enrollment period this year than we had planned for. And that really is, as you say, driving the increase in the guidance for the year.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. So -- okay. Got it. So you booked more revenues, so there's more operating leverage. Okay.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. And it's more in the pattern of the costs that are needed for them to prepare for the enrollment period.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And so you guided back down to the next quarter, right, because of seasonality. But is there an element where you, for certain of the exchange segments, where you might not have as clear of a lens? And maybe you could do -- enroll more than you currently plan or that would just be on the retail level and that's kind of small?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I'd say, again, so what's clear in that business is that the first half of the fiscal year is going to be lower in terms of margin. The pattern, particularly in the September quarter, the pattern of the ramp-up of resources is less predictable and it kind of straddles that September-October time frame. So again, not really signaling anything different about the business or certainly about revenue expectations. It's just about the productivity of the ramp-up of costs and the second fiscal quarter, the December quarter, is not unexpected. I mean, that's where we expect it to be, so.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And my last question, Talent and Rewards revenue growth, clearly very strong. I was hoping to get a sense for the initiatives that drove the growth and whether there's an element of seasonality or onetime projects. In the press release, it cites new sectors being targeted and exact comp, it talks about a large project in Rewards, et cetera.", "John J. Haley", "Yes. So I think the Talent and Rewards is our business that is the most cyclical. And so we do have -- it's not surprising that we sometimes have much better than we expected in terms of growth and sometimes somewhat lower. We definitely see that there. I think, as we've said, the technology portion of the business is the one that the -- we're really seeing technology needs in buying increasing this quarter. And we think, for the near future, among all of our clients, we're looking for growth in that business in each region of the world, although some markets will be more active than in others. I think the key thing there is our suite of tools combined with the domain expertise that Towers Watson has in human capital really helped to set us apart in the market.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And so you would expect potentially a slowing because there were some kind of onetime -- some projects talked about in the earnings release or who knows for kind of the rest of the year?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. The other thing I'd add to what John says and there is, for us, while we know the first half of the fiscal year is going to be stronger, there's a little bit of ambiguity and kind of revenue patterns for the first quarter and the second quarter so -- particularly, in the surveys business. So the underlying momentum of that business is good and I think John went through that. The second quarter guidance doesn't reflect weakening in the business. It really is all about the difficult comparable from last year.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask on the Exchange business to start. The off-cycle enrollments that you described, what -- I guess, what are you hearing from clients that's driving that? Kind of they just not -- they don't want to wait for the next enrollment period or are they concerned about the too many companies trying to squeeze through in onetime period? And can you talk about whether that's more on the Retiree or the Active side that you're seeing that.", "John J. Haley", "Okay. So these off-cycle enrollments that we're talking about are all Retiree enrollments that we have here. I think when you think about it, the off-cycle enrollments offer the opportunity that they're not going when everybody is. It's a lot like a company having their fiscal year sometime other than January 1 to December 31. They get more attention during the audit, they get a chance to have a little more focus there. So I think those are the kind of things that are attractive about the off cycle. From our standpoint, the off cycle is attractive because it means we can -- we talked about eliminating some of the seasonality, and it's not just with the revenue, but it's also with our resources. We get to keep resources on a more permanent basis.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And is it primarily public sector or are you seeing this in the private sector, too?", "John J. Haley", "No, this is private sector, too. I mean, I wouldn't -- this is 12 clients. As we said, it's not going to have a material impact on the FY '14 results. So I wouldn't want to read too much into this, but I do think it's a very positive trend and it's one that, to the extent it continues, it will really help us and our clients a lot.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then can I ask on a few, I guess, numbers questions. One, the other expense, Roger, that shows up, I guess the segment results were much better than expected, but then there's a big other expense as I looked at the reconciliation. Can you help me understand what that is?", "Roger F. Millay", "The other line for corporate nonoperating type items, what's in there is -- so as part of the finalization of the system rollout last year, that positioned us for the final true-up and harmonization of all of our financial policies. And quite frankly, we had hoped that, that was going to come out kind of net neutral. And we did have in -- as part of that process, we did have $10 million or so this year or this quarter that was a hit in the numbers in truing up policies, all the legacy policies. So that's what that is.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "That's a onetime true-up? Is that -- are you...", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. We're on the new policies now. But the catch up to true-up to harmonize policies was a onetime step up, that's right.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then can you just -- I missed what you said. So the guidance includes both restructuring charges and a gain on the sale of the Reinsurance business?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. The gain is not in there. And we expect a gain now. But the guidance does include what we anticipate for the rest of the year in restructuring costs and we expect the heaviest quarter. We expect some through the remaining quarters of the year, but we expect the heaviest quarter to be the second quarter.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And last numbers question, just given -- I know part of the tax rate was an unusual item, but with the U.K. tax rate also stepping down, what's the kind of longer-term view of a sustainable tax rate for you guys?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I think we're still, at this point, in that 34% to 35% range. One of the impacts of the way mix is changing now with the growth in the Exchange business and the disposition of the Brokerage business, because Brokerage had a meaningful position in the U.K. There is actually here, at this point now, a little bit of upward pressure on the tax rate, while at the same time we continue the efforts that we've had the last several years to restructure, to push the rate lower. So it's 34%, 35%, which kind of incorporates that little upward pressure, but we hope to continue to push it down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "For your updated full year EPS guidance, can you tell us how much taking out the Reinsurance Brokerage impacted EPS?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I mean, there are several kind of moving pieces to that. But if, one, kind of net-net, if they were 4.5% or 5% of revenues, the impact is about proportional, although there were, and this was one of the references we made in the script, there were some -- it was an asset sale in the U.S. So some of the corporate-related costs kind of there was an overhang, so the impact in the short term is a little bit more than the 4.5% to 5%. But again we're restructuring to offset that. So over time, it's about proportional.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And that $10 million in severance and restructuring, that had not been in your original guidance, correct?", "Roger F. Millay", "That's correct.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Two quick numbers questions and then an Exchange question. Could you talk about how you're thinking about discretionary compensation going forward and professional expenses?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, I think in terms of discretionary comp, there really isn't a change in the view of mid- to kind of upper-40-percentage-type ranges of pre-bonus operating income. So I don't think we view that any differently at this point. And are you asking, Sara, about the trend in professional services, is that...", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Sorry. It was -- there was discretionary comp and then asking about the expectation in trends for professional services, in that they were -- it looks like that they were up year-over-year in the first quarter by about $5 million. And I'm wondering how we should think about that for the next year?", "Roger F. Millay", "There wasn't a particular driver that I would note there. A little bit of it is because of pass-through expenses, a little bit is because we had a higher level of IT-related professional service and support. I would -- and I don't have a specific forecast to that line, but I think it could run at these levels or closer to these levels, we're doing more work in the technology space in the company. So I don't expect any big jumps, and that line does jump around a little bit, but I don't think there's a big trend that, that indicates. Although maybe there's a little pressure for it to be a little higher than it was last year.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then last question. Could you help us think about your capacity in the Retiree Exchange business and maybe just walk us through how many retirees you're now serving and how you think that should ramp over the course of the year? And what I'm really trying to understand more about is how easy is it for you to ramp your capacity to serve more retirees that you're bringing on to the system? Because, obviously, there are people involved in that, and so I'm wondering how easy or difficult it is to do that.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I mean, Sara, it's Roger, I'll give a couple of comments on that and then John may have some other thoughts, too. And you cached the question in terms of how easy. Well, as you know, it's a very intensive process for us to add large, new client engagements. So it's something we're very focused on. The technology is there to scale. And so I think it's maybe a little bit additive to what John said about the 12 clients. Certainly, we have more capacity to add volume as it gets spread throughout the year. And that's something that we actively talk to clients about and we actively manage as one sales season ends and we move potentially into the next one. We're hopeful of avoiding that pressure of having to add very significant levels of enrollment just in the fall period. And if we smooth it out, it's good for everyone. It's good for our clients, we can take more onto the platform and it's good for our business. But it's an intensive planning process and we're very focused on having, I suppose I'd call it maybe Plan A and Plan B to manage through what the demand really is, but it's attention that we have to manage.", "John J. Haley", "I think, Sara, the other thing I would add to that is that each year with Extend and now with Exchange Solutions, we've seen some fairly significant increases in the number of new lives we've brought on board. And we've been able to scale up repeatedly to handle these very significant increases. We're hopeful that we're going to be doing that again this next year, too. And as we've done it, we've held ourselves to a standard of not just a good experience for the people who are enrolling, but an excellent experience for them. And we continue to be able to deliver that. So we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to scale this up. But, as Roger identified, one of the key constraints is just making sure we can get a lot of good people to take the calls and to handle that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes the line of Paul Ginocchio of Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just -- you mentioned in the press release about 300 clients related to ACA. I guess that's across the platform. Because I thought the last time you had commented you had 50 Exchange clients. Can you just clarify the difference? And then Roger, do you have any -- do you know what the net cash from the acquisition's going to be after any taxes?", "Roger F. Millay", "From the disposition?", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, sorry.", "Roger F. Millay", "I don't -- I actually don't have off the top of my head what the net number is. It's actually not taxable in the U.K. So it's certainly a rate that's lower than -- the overall rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate, but that's as much as I can tell you sitting there.", "John J. Haley", "And, Paul, the question on the other one. We have 55 Fortune 500 companies in the Retiree Exchange and then we have about 300 companies in total, and a number of them come from our channel partners.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could ask one more, John. I know funding levels are up in pensions. Isn't that good for pension projects? And when will we start to see that kind of pension project work because of increased funding levels?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. I think that's a good question. I think the interest rate environment can do a lot of things. It can -- there may be an increased interest in annuity purchases, we may also look at more planned termination analysis for frozen plans, people may look at -- relook at their funding policies and their asset allocation work. So there's a lot of these things that rising interest rates can generate from the companies changing their budgets to consideration of assumptions, reviews, workforce management issues with people taking their retiring and taking their lump sums early. So there is a lot of things that could happen as that occurs. I think the -- we wouldn't expect to see that in this next quarter, if there is an uptick as a result of improved funding in the rising interest rate environment, it would be in the second half of FY '14.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer of SunTrust.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Did you say that so far enrollment is up 15% compared to the period a year ago?", "John J. Haley", "Yes.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "How much of total enrollment does that represent? Just trying to get a sense for how far through it you are or how much is yet to go.", "John J. Haley", "We don't have that information right now. Or we're not prepared to share that.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Curious in the Health Care Exchange business, how far in advance does a client sign up before they actually have their open enrollment? So I'm trying to get a sense for your visibility.", "John J. Haley", "Well, ideally, if somebody is implementing -- let's take the typical retiree case like that, if they were implementing January 1 of the year, we would like to have it in the first half of the prior calendar year. We'd like to know about it. We've run into July, on some cases, in doing it. But that's really cutting it pretty close. It's pretty similar for the Actives, too. Ideally, and I think as we this ramping up more and more, we're going to be looking -- I mentioned the 2015 selling season has already started. I think we're going to be having some more visibility into that earlier in the year, but it would be in the first half of the year before.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "In terms of the off-cycle enrollments, it's clear that there's some operating benefit to you in terms of utilization and margins within the segment. What are the benefits to a client? I'm trying to get a sense for whether you're counseling clients to look for off-cycle enrollments or that is emanating from them.", "John J. Haley", "Yes. I think -- and I analogized it earlier to doing audits off cycle. And I do think that there is a lot to -- I do think there's a lot of similarity there. We counsel clients about those kind of advantages as being there in terms of doing an off cycle. It means it's probably lower-execution risk in terms of doing anything. So we will counsel them about that. We don't actively push people to do off cycle, we leave that more to decide them. But we do try to point out some of the advantages.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. My last question has to do with capital deployment. Your cash flow is up this year with the sale of the Reinsurance Brokerage business. Your available cash and liquidity is high. What are you intending to do with it, because it certainly doesn't seem like there are a whole lot of internal uses for the investment of that cash?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. Maybe I'll just comment on kind of the model that we think about that and which the comment is really that our thoughts haven't changed. And we continue to prioritize flexibility. Certainly, the fact, as I said, that we expect to buy roughly $75 million of shares for the rest of this fiscal year is the follow-on to the comment that we made at Analyst Day, that we expect to be a more consistent purchaser of our shares. And that's given the -- I guess that reflects the view that we have now on our flexibility. But we continue to be hopeful of finding good acquisition opportunities that we'll also take advantage of that balance sheet flexibility that we have.", "John J. Haley", "Yes. And I guess I would just echo what Roger said. We don't really have any change in the way we think about this. We've always said that doing high-quality acquisitions would be our #1 priority. But we're careful about the acquisitions we do. So we spend time thinking about those and they have to pass some rigorous tests. But if we could find that, that's clearly at the top end. And if we can't do that, then we will look to return the money to shareholders.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "If I could sneak in one last one. Do you have any expectations for an impact in the business from the change in use-it-or-lose-it in FSAs?", "John J. Haley", "No. We don't see a big impact from that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just thinking -- I understand that most of your Exchange business is in the Retirees. But to the extent that there's any of the business that you're chasing after in the Active side, has the issues with the federal exchange website led any clients to kind of delay dealing with that right now? How has that changed that part of business at all, if at all?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. Thanks, Shlomo. I think the first thing I'd say is, as you rightly observe, most of our business right now is with Retirees. When I mentioned the selling season having started early, though, that selling season is as much an Active phenomenon, if not more so than our Retiree phenomenon. We have not seen any real impact from the problems with the federal exchanges causing clients to back off of looking at the kind of exchanges that we offer. I think they're able to distinguish between those 2. And what we do doesn't really depend on the federal exchanges at all, with the exception of the Access product that we offer, where we offer people access to that. So we haven't seen any impact at all from that.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Great. And we've seen in historical years sometimes the Surveys business revenue gets pulled from, let's say, 4Q to 3Q. Is that what's going on this year or is there really a change that companies need to address because of some increased mobility?", "Roger F. Millay", "And so you're talking about first quarter versus second quarter?", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, the Survey work. I'm just checking is that because you have an overall increase or was there some pull-forward there?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, so there's growth in that business. I think the first quarter ended up being a little bit higher than we had forecast. But again, there is kind of ambiguity in that September-October period. So we saw some growth, but maybe a little different timing.", "John J. Haley", "We don't -- and I guess, Shlomo, I'd say that we don't think so. We don't think we're seeing a pull-forward of that. And as you know, when we do see anything like that, we try to be real clear about identifying that. So that's not the way we're interpreting it right now.", "Roger F. Millay", "I'd just also add that -- and so I think we're referring more to the Compensation Surveys. In our Employee Survey business, we have had some success here recently in getting new clients and see more activity there. So that's a part of what we're seeing, underlying the good results in Talent and Rewards that John referred to.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then for the adjusted numbers now, are we -- are you guys now absorbing all the stock comp and transaction expenses that we should expect going forward?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. Well, yes, on the stock comp. With respect to transaction expenses, there were expenses -- normal expenses of bankers and lawyers of selling the Brokerage business. So that is an adjustment that we've made in this quarter. And to the extent on that kind of M&A activity we would continue to adjust for that, but that's the only caveat that I'd make there.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "But this stuff coming from the Towers parent deal is -- you're not doing that anymore?", "Roger F. Millay", "It's done.", "John J. Haley", "Yes, that's all finished.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just in terms of -- and this will be my last question, the adjusting the headcount to demand in the RFS business. Can you just talk a little bit about how we should expect it to play out through the year? I assume that most of it is near term and then kind of trail off. Are we going to see some in 3Q and 4Q, as well?", "John J. Haley", "Well, we expect that the adjustment of the supply and demand will occur throughout the whole fiscal year, is what we've said. But I think we've already taken the biggest steps.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "With regards to the 12 off-cycle clients that you signed on the Exchange Solutions, did you give the number of lives that were associated with those?", "John J. Haley", "We didn't. We didn't give it. But let me just -- it's about 22,000.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So they're tending to be a little bit smaller? Are they basically coming through the Fidelity relationship or is that kind of a mix?", "John J. Haley", "No. They're not basically -- there's no particular difference between those clients, the distribution or pattern in them, than the other ones. We don't have -- we don't have -- some of the large, really, mega clients they tended -- have always tended to be January 1.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. Okay. But this really does help in terms of smoothing out the capacity coming on and the utilization.", "John J. Haley", "This does help in terms of this. And even these 12 that we've added during here, I mentioned that it's not a material impact on FY '14. But these are actually all through calendar 2014. And so, in fact, I think there's more in the second half of calendar 2014 than in the first half. So that would actually push them into our fiscal 2015.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. And with regards to pricing, has there been any change with regards to the pricing for those relative to what we've heard previously?", "John J. Haley", "No. No change.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then just -- I want to step back to the Analyst Day. When you did your Analyst Day, you basically ended up -- you were doing that 2 days in front of the Walgreens announcement being on the front page of The Wall Street Journal. Since that time, there's been more press. There's been more discussion among potential competitors. What would you say has changed relative to what you discussed back then, either in terms of client interest or competitors, pricing? Anything that would be material as we think about the longer-term outlook.", "John J. Haley", "So I would just say this, I think by the time we got to Analyst Day, we were feeling very positive about the outlook for the Active Exchange business over the next several years. And when we had talked to folks about 1 or 2 years ago about this, it was something where we were thinking that there was a wide range of outcomes. And I remember saying that I thought that the low-growth scenarios in that were just a lot less likely, and we were thinking that there would be a significant number of employees that would be enrolled on Active Exchanges. We continue to feel positive about that, whether it's the Walgreens announcement, whether it's the kind of interest that we've seen from clients as we're out talking to them and the kind of interest they show in exchanges, all of that has contributed to our feeling that this is going to be a pretty good-sized business for the whole country and for our organization.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And any update with regards the retail test in the 50 stores?", "John J. Haley", "No. That's just under way. And we'll probably be able to talk a little bit about that in succeeding quarters here.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then quick numbers question. Roger, you mentioned the policy changes with regards to the system throughput. What exactly does that mean?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, so the specific thing that had the biggest impact was around receivables and receivable -- how receivable reserves are established. So as a result of that, there was an increase. And you may remember I've referred to, over the last couple of years, differences in the policies that we had and how that changed some of the corporate reserving. So now we have one way to do it and it was a onetime -- we stepped up to a consolidated approach to that, starting July 1.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So instead of thinking like we originally did that, potentially, there would be positive impact it ended up being more of a negative impact.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I mean, I think we actually thought it was going to be an overall neutral impact. But -- that's right, and it ended up to be modestly negative.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then going back to an earlier question with regards to specifically the pension project work given where rates are today. Is there any reason why that couldn't potentially start in the March quarter?", "John J. Haley", "No. There is no reason that, that couldn't start then. And I think it remains to be seen what will happen with that. But I think one of the interesting things about the bulk lump sum work is there's -- it hasn't disappeared at all. There's been a low level of that, that's continued. And I personally think that it's something around here, it's around here to stay and we'll see some spikes up over the coming years. I don't think we can necessarily predict exactly which quarters it will be, but this will be a continuing feature of the landscape.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Volshteyn of JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "John, I wanted to go to your comments about corporate, global corporate discretionary spend. It sounded like it was stabilized in 1 or 2 quarters ago. But your comments today, kind of seemed like it might be going through a double dip. Can you give us a little more color on that?", "John J. Haley", "This is this with regard to RCS?", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Broadly, but RCS specifically, as well. Yes.", "John J. Haley", "Yes. Actually, no. I think what we said a quarter or so ago was that the RCS would be -- would have a challenging environment this whole year. And we didn't expect to really see growth until fiscal 2015 in that business. And so there's nothing that has changed about our outlook for that and the steps we're taking to try to align the business the right way. I think we're right on target with where we'd expect it to be.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. And I think -- just a clarification of this is where you were going. Our comments weren't related to global general corporate discretionary spend. It was specific to that part of the business.", "John J. Haley", "Right.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. That's a good clarification. But -- and sort of globally outside of Risk and Financial Services, how do you assess the environment?", "John J. Haley", "I mean, I think, it's -- one of the interesting things about Towers Watson is that each line of business has its own dynamics and everything like that. But when people ask about the general business environment, the segment that I tend to think of most is Talent and Rewards, because it's the one that is most affected by the cyclicality of the business -- of business generally. And, frankly, that's a business that's growing. We had a good growth this quarter. And we're feeling good about the prospects for growth for Talent and Rewards for the fiscal year.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's helpful. Going back to the Exchange business. It seems that -- and based on the comments in the press release, that you're making more changes in the health consulting areas to the help marketing efforts on the active employee exchange. Is that more recent change or that's been sort of gradual through your Analyst Day and prior?", "John J. Haley", "No. I think what we're seeing is, if you think about it, the focus that we had on this year, in the beginning of the year, was making sure that we had the right administrative platform to handle the clients that we were going to bring on for 1/1/2014. And we had our health-care folks intimately involved in the plan design and working with the carriers to do that. But now we're saying that we also need to focus a lot of the marketing and the ramp-up for bringing new clients on for 2015. And that's a shift more of some resources from a general distribution, from administration to health care.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And can you update us on the membership on the Active side of the business? How many lives?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. Let me just get my note here. So we have -- the Actives, we should have about 40,000 covered lives for the 2 clients that we have on the Active Exchange. About 30,000 covered lives on the Access client. That's providing access to the federal exchanges. And then enrollment will be effective April 1. And that does not include Towers Watson's associates. And we're doing the Active Exchange for our own associates also.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. That's helpful. I have a couple of model questions. Roger, what percentage of revenue now comes in euro and in pounds, approximately?", "Roger F. Millay", "Boy, I'll be honest. I haven't looked at specific percentages for that recently. But I don't think it's changed much from the 33% or so that we had with about 2/3 of that or roughly 22% of the company in the pound and the rest in the euros.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. And then regarding the Reinsurance business in 2013. Is there a seasonality in that business that we should know about when we model year-over-year comparisons? It seems in the second quarter it was a little heavier than your first quarter run rate of $40 million.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. So the big periods for them for the renewal activity was July and January. So the March and the September quarters, heavier seasonality.", "John J. Haley", "Yes. And this January is bigger than July.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no additional questions in the queue. And I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing. Please proceed.", "John J. Haley", "Okay. Thanks to everyone for joining us this morning and we look forward to reviewing our second quarter results with you in February.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

My name is Shantelle, and I will be your facilitator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.", "Aida Sukys", "Thanks, Shantelle, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Towers Watson Earnings Call. I'm here today with Roger Millay, Towers Watson's Chief Financial Officer. John Haley, Towers Watson's Chief Executive Officer, will not be attending the call today due to a personal matter.", "Please refer to our website for this morning's press release. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay via telephone for the next week by dialing (617) 801-6888, confirmation number 98259601. The replay will also be available for the next 3 months on our website.", "This call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of forward-looking statements and the risks and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking results, investors should review the Forward-looking Statements section of the earnings press release issued this morning, a copy of which is available on our website at www.towerswatson.com, as well as other disclosures under the heading of Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this earnings call.", "During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. For a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures under Regulation G to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release and the accompanying financial tables we posted on our website this morning.", "After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger Millay.", "Roger F. Millay", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us. As Aida said, John sends his regrets, and he's sorry he was unable to join the call.", "Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. These results -- the prior year results and fiscal '14 guidance reflect the divestiture of our Brokerage business. The Brokerage business has been reported as discontinued operations in our current financial statements. The sale was finalized on November 6.", "We recently announced the expansion of our Exchange Solutions segment, which will combine all of our OneExchange resources as well as the health and welfare administration work under one segment. The leadership appointment was effective February 1 and did not impact the second quarter segment reporting we'll be discussing today. We'll begin to reflect the segment reporting realignment when the specific organization movements are finalized, which we expect to occur as of April 1.", "Reported revenues for the quarter were $888 million, a decrease of 2.5% over the prior year's second quarter reported revenues and down 2% on an organic basis. On a constant currency basis, revenues decreased 2%. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures.", "Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $172 million or 19.4% of revenues. The prior year second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $176 million or 19.3% of revenues.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.21, up 9%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.40. Although revenues were a little softer than expected, we continue to believe the underlying business and long-term prospects are strong. I'll provide a more detailed discussion of the revenue drivers in each of the segment overviews.", "We continued to make significant progress this quarter against our strategic positioning efforts. We purchased Liazon, the leading exchange platform. This rounded out our portfolio of exchange offerings by adding fully insured health care options and enhancing the ancillary benefit programs to the OneExchange platform. This acquisition will enable Towers Watson and its strong network of broker partners to market to a wide range of employers.", "Our first large-scale client enrollments utilizing the self-funded exchange platform proved to be very successful. We continued to see strong execution and improved efficiencies in our Retiree exchange enrollments as we enrolled a record number of new members. And finally, we recently kicked off our first large-scale enrollment under our Access OneExchange module, where we provide assistance to employees enrolling on the public exchanges. We've now successfully engaged all of the employee populations we had envisioned under OneExchange.", "Given the investments we've made and will continue to make in the Exchange business, the acquisitions of Liazon and Extend Health, the number of internal resources dedicated to product development, communications, sales and technology development, we felt it was time to formally pull the group together to better leverage our resources and tools. We feel very confident in our market-leading technology, best-in-class benefit programs and the capacity for offering a full slate of active and retiree exchange offerings. This move to formalize the related OneExchange offerings into a single segment will help us accelerate a more cohesive and powerful go-to-market strategy, which takes advantage of the full spectrum of our OneExchange offerings.", "John and I would like to thank all of the talented leaders and associates that contributed to the success we've seen to-date in building and contributing to the development of OneExchange. While it may seem the private exchange concepts are new to the market, there are decades of experience and excellent work that have enabled Towers Watson to develop the OneExchange offering in what seems like a very short time. It wouldn't have been possible without the strong expertise of our health care consultants in designing group benefit plans, our TAS group in developing the health and welfare administration platform that serves as the framework for the Active self-insured platform, the Exchange Solutions Retiree team that brought true innovation to the industry and helped set the framework for private exchanges and the Liazon team, which developed a world-class platform and a unique go-to-market strategy, which opened up a new market for Towers Watson. We're fortunate to have extraordinarily gifted associates throughout our organization.", "Now let's look at the performance of each of our segments. As we look at the revenue performance of our businesses this quarter, we have to remember that we're comparing to a period of very strong temporary revenue drivers, which we'll discuss in detail -- more detail as we review the segment results. On an organic basis, Benefits decreased by 6%, Risk and Financial Services decreased by 6%, Talent and Rewards decreased by 3%, and Exchange Solutions grew 122%.", "For the quarter, Benefits -- the Benefits segment had revenues of $487 million. Benefits segment revenues were down 6% on a constant currency basis. Retirement revenues decreased by 8% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the U.S. While we forecasted the year-over-year decline in revenue, the results were softer than anticipated. As you may recall, there was a benefit in the MAP-21 legislation which provided strong incentives for organizations to complete bulk lump sum projects by December 5 -- by December 31, 2012, which resulted in a 15% constant currency revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal '13 for the Americas.", "However, we projected a number of special projects and strategy work which didn't materialize. With improved comparables in the second half of the fiscal year and expected increases in strategy work and bulk lump sum work, we anticipate a return to modest revenue growth.", "Health and Group Benefits revenues were down by 5% on a constant currency basis. We attribute the revenue softness to clients taking a wait-and-see attitude as they assessed exchange options and held off on consulting work. We also underestimated the impact of the diversion of consulting resources to address the Active exchange product development and sales effort. While it isn't translating to revenue at this point, we continue to be pleased with the interest we're seeing in the marketplace.", "Looking at the rest of the fiscal year, we see the consulting pipeline returning to more normal levels as clients continue to need to address cost issues. The move to expand the Exchange Solutions segment should help leverage our sales resources more effectively as well.", "Technology and Administration Solutions revenues increased by 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to new client work in EMEA and the Americas. We enrolled approximately 45,000 Active employees and dependents this past quarter on the self-insured OneExchange platform, and we're extremely pleased with the process and system performance.", "While we experienced some challenges in the Benefits segment this quarter, we expect to see modest growth for the second half of the year.", "Now let me turn to Risk and Financial Services. For the quarter, Risk and Financial Services had revenues of $161 million as compared to $172 million for the second quarter of fiscal '13.", "As forecasted, revenues were down 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by a decrease in Risk Consulting and Software. Risk Consulting and Software revenue declined by 11%. We started to see revenue declines in the fourth quarter of fiscal '13, and this continued to be the case in the first half of fiscal '14. We've completed most of the restructuring efforts we targeted, much of which took place during the second quarter.", "Investment had 3% constant currency revenue growth, led by EMEA. This revenue growth comes on top of a very challenging 12% increase in the second quarter of fiscal '13. We continue to be very pleased with the pipeline, but the comparables will be challenging in the third quarter as well, due to a significant one-time project that was completed in the second and third quarters of fiscal '13.", "We continue to anticipate RCS revenue beginning to stabilize during the fourth quarter of fiscal '14 and into fiscal '15 and expect that the Investment business will continue to deliver strong results.", "Now let's move on to Talent and Rewards. For the quarter, Talent and Rewards had revenues of $170 million, with revenues down 3% on a constant currency basis. Data surveys and technology revenues increased by 5% as demand for HR software implementations and employee surveys continued to increase significantly. Rewards, Talent and Communications revenues decreased by 11% on a constant currency basis. While economic conditions that typically drive this business are solid and client demand remained steady, a number of factors contributed to softer revenues than forecast.", "Communications consultants were redeployed to support OneExchange product development and sales. And there was a heavier focus than expected on planned long-term growth and profitability initiatives. As expected, Executive Compensation revenues were down 4% on a constant currency basis as compared to 16% growth last year. Consulting demand in this business remains solid. While this quarter was softer than anticipated in Rewards, Talent and Communication, we continue to expect revenue growth for the segment in the second half of the year.", "Finally, I'd like to move to the Exchange Solutions segment. For the quarter, Exchange Solutions had revenues of $36 million, an increase of 127% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, the Liazon purchase was finalized in November, and this overview will include the Liazon active enrollments.", "We completed a very successful annual enrollment process, where we enrolled a record number of members on both the Retiree and the Liazon exchanges. We now have in excess of 560,000 Retiree members and more than 80,000 participants on the Liazon active exchange. We're also in the process of assisting in the enrollment of a large group of employees to the public exchanges for an effective date of April 1.", "The sales pipeline for our retiring -- Retiree offering is strong, and we feel like there's good momentum in the market. Organizations are starting to better understand the value proposition of the Retiree exchange, and we're pleased with the off-cycle pipeline as well. The Active exchanges are certainly gaining momentum in terms of exposure, but the adoption rate isn't as straightforward to forecast. There's a high level of interest from many organizations, but there's also a great deal of information companies need to understand as they make a decision to move to a private exchange. We'll certainly have early movers that want to join in 2015 but expect an acceleration of adoption rates to materialize for the 2016 and 2017 enrollment periods. We've signed our first Active client for an off-cycle enrollment later this calendar year, which is something of a rarity in the Active market. We've been investing in our capacity and believe that we're well positioned to handle the demand for the 2015 enrollment.", "As we look at OneExchange as a whole, it's been quite a journey already. When Extend Health was acquired, we had approximately 200,000 Retiree members. And now, just 1.5 years later, there are approximately 700,000 OneExchange participants represented across our Active, Retiree and Access platforms. We're extremely pleased with the framework we've built and future prospect -- and the future prospects of Exchange Solutions.", "While we did see some revenue softness in the second quarter, we also had some lines of business with very solid results. We don't believe the softness is representative of a trend, and we still feel very good about the year in general and in the investments we've made and will continue to make for our long-term growth and value creation.", "Now let's turn to segment margins in a more detailed financial overview. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition costs -- acquisition accounting costs.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had a 30% NOI margin, Risk and Financial Services had a 21% NOI margin, and Talent and Rewards had a 31% NOI margin. Exchange Solutions had a negative 20% NOI margin in what is expected to be a seasonally low profitability quarter for them. All segments achieved or exceeded their forecasted profitability margins.", "Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter was $86 million. Adjusted net income for -- from continuing operations was $100 million. The tax rate for continuing operations for the quarter was 32%, which is slightly lower than our Q2 guided rate of 34% to 35%.", "Let's move on to the balance sheet, where I'd first like to point out one notable change. As part of the Towers Watson fund of funds business, we introduced 2 funds this past quarter as part of our pooled version of our existing delegated offering. The accounting requirements related to certain of these funds dictated that we recognize on our balance sheet the fair value of investments made by our clients in funds managed by us and consolidated as variable interest entities. The value of these investments was $277.1 million as of December 31, 2013, and they appear on the balance sheet as investments of consolidated variable interest entity and are also included in noncontrolling interest. The consolidation had no impact to net income attributable to common stockholders, adjusted EBITDA, total stockholders' equity or free cash flow. We continue to review the fund of funds product solutions to determine if this consolidation will be required in the future.", "More broadly on the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. As of December 31, we had $458 million in cash available for our use. As of December 31, our free cash outflow was $59 million as compared to free -- a free cash outflow of $33 million in fiscal '13. The main driver of the year-over-year increase in cash outflow was a higher discretionary bonus payout. As a reminder, free cash flow generally improves through the fiscal year. We still expect solid free cash generation for the year.", "We had $35 million of borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter as a result of the Liazon acquisition. This fiscal year, we began paying down our $250 million term loan, which was used to fund the Extend Health purchase. The term loan amortizes at a rate of $6.25 million per quarter, with a final maturity date of June 1, 2017.", "This quarter, we repurchased $41 million of Towers Watson stock. And we'll continue to repurchase shares through the year for a total of approximately $90 million this fiscal year. As of December 31, there was a balance of $120 million of the $150 million open-market purchase program authorized by the board in February 2012. The last tranche of Class B shares related to the Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt merger, approximately 5.4 million shares, converted to Class A shares as of January 1, 2014.", "As we discussed during Analyst Day, we targeted a 10% dividend payout ratio for fiscal year '14. In November, the board announced a dividend increase of 22% to $0.14 a share. As a reminder, we accelerated and paid a full year of dividend -- dividends in December 2012 for calendar 2013. Quarterly dividend payments have resumed in calendar 2014.", "As a result of our second quarter results, we've updated our fiscal year guidance. Overall, we expect revenues to be approximately $3.5 billion. We're expecting our fiscal '14 adjusted diluted earnings per share for continuing operations to be within the range of $5.55 to $5.65. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin for the year to be within the range of 19.0% to 19.5%. This guidance includes severance and restructuring costs of around $15 million, of which $9 million was posted in the second quarter. We've increased the projected restructuring costs from $10 million as we continue to find efficiencies in workflow and staffing alignment.", "We outlined in our discussion of the Liazon acquisition that we expected EPS dilution of $0.10 a share to $0.15 a share, related to the building of OneExchange and Active and creating capacity to handle significant enrollment activity over the next couple of years. We now expect to run at the high end of that initial $0.10 to $0.15 range. The dilution should impact the Exchange Solutions segment for fiscal '14 but may be split between Benefits and Exchange Solutions during the third quarter, while the segment realignment is completed.", "We expect the fiscal '14 income tax rate to be around 31%. This estimate does not include potential tax examinations or other items that could settle in the third or fourth quarter of this fiscal year.", "For the fiscal year, our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of USD 1.61 to the British pound and an average exchange rate of USD 1.36 to the euro. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 71 million. GAAP earnings per share will continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share.", "Now let's review our fiscal year guidance for the segments. We expect flat year-over-year constant currency revenue in the Benefits segment. While we expect to have low single-digit growth in the second half of the fiscal year, the strong revenue growth experienced by the retirement business in fiscal '13 continues to suppress overall top line growth measures for the full fiscal year. The NOI margin for Benefits is expected to be in the low-30% range. We've adjusted both revenue and margin guidance down slightly to account for the softer second quarter revenue results and the continued investments we'll be making in OneExchange.", "Next, in the Risk and Financial Services segment, we expect constant currency revenue to decline by mid-single digits. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low 20%. We expect margins to increase during the year as Risk and Consulting Services, or RCS, has finalized the majority of their restructuring effort. While RCS exceeded their second quarter revenue goals, we believe it's prudent to tighten the fiscal '14 revenue range slightly, given the degree of change occurring in the business.", "In the Talent and Rewards segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. While they had a difficult comparable in the second quarter, we continue to feel good about their underlying business momentum for the year. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low-20% range. Second quarter results were dampened by top line performance, and the Communications group is expected to continue to devote some focus to the OneExchange offering.", "Finally, in the Exchange Solutions segment, we expect revenue growth of around 80%. We expect the NOI margin to be in the mid- to high-teens range. The change in the NOI guidance includes the projected Liazon operating losses for the second half of the fiscal year. The outlook for the Retiree margins hasn't changed. As a reminder, Exchange Solutions profitability is seasonally low in the first half of the fiscal year as we incur all the costs of enrollment in the first half but only recognize revenue on a monthly basis starting with the effective date of the policy. In the majority of cases, the policies are effective January 1.", "I'd like to conclude by acknowledging the excellent work of our associates this quarter in keeping the business operating effectively while also developing the OneExchange offerings and implementing our cost rationalization and restructuring strategies. It's been a busy quarter. We've asked the team to focus on a number of diverse initiatives, and, as always, they've responded really well to help build for our future. This activity may have dampened our quarterly results but is necessary to stay ahead of market drivers. Our underlying business is sound, and we're really excited about our long-term prospects.", "Now we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Roger, did the enrollment of Retirees of, I think, 145,000 that you mentioned, if I got that right, did that meet your expectation?", "Roger F. Millay", "I think you're remembering last year's number of 145,000. So what we said is 560,000 for total or in excess of 560,000. So what that communicates is that we were in excess of 160,000 for enrollments for this year.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And did that number meet your expectation?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, it did. Yes. Yes, what we had said, if you recall, Tobey, I think a couple of quarters ago, that we expected to exceed the 145,000 of last year, which clearly we did. So...", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Right. And I was curious, what sort of an impact you think the off-cycle enrollments, as well as your web broker position for the federal exchange, can contribute during calendar '14?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, maybe just step back a little bit on that question, one of the things you've heard us talk about really since we acquired Extend Health was that we had hoped for a more even process through the year, and the team's really been working hard to develop the pipeline of off-cycle enrollments. And last year, it was a positive for us, and that momentum continues into this year. We don't have a specific forecast for you on levels of off-cycle enrollments, but the momentum is positive. It's still, of course -- year-end enrollments is the big material emphasis. With respect to the web broker...", "Aida Sukys", "Could I -- Tobey, this is Aida. I could probably take that one. I think that we're just going through the first really large Access enrollment process right now to the public exchanges, and so, again, I think that it's a little early to say what the overall impact is going to be. But we feel positive about what's happening now, but it's a little too early to tell about what's going to happen with the -- it won't have a huge impact or we don't anticipate having a significant impact on fiscal year '14 revenues.", "Roger F. Millay", "Did we have a number out there for the April 1 or?", "Aida Sukys", "Yes, there's approximately 30,000 employees that we're helping along into the public exchanges, but that's also fee-based from the client. And then we'd be getting any commissions on top of that. But we don't have a good trend -- historical trend yet to understand how many of the commissions we'll get from those 30,000.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful, Aida. Yes, my last question, and I'll get back in the queue, is what are clients telling you about what I think you described as maybe some project pushouts from the December quarter and the potential for de-risking work to resume in calendar 2014?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, an important question for retirement. So as we mentioned in the script, we did anticipate a little bit stronger project activity as calendar 2013 closed. But the outlook for calendar '14, given the change in funding positions, particularly for 12/31 companies, is positive. So we do expect enhanced activity. Again, don't have any specific numbers for you now. I think the thinking right now is that momentum is likely to build more in the second half of the calendar year than in the first half. But we think the de-risking in the bulk lump sum activity will be stronger this year.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'll start off with some questions on the Exchanges. When do you think you'll know the timing about new Active sign-ups for the year? And I understand that the ramp is sort of a long-term process. Do you think it's reasonable to think that you'll be able to add more clients for the fall of 2014?", "Roger F. Millay", "You may need to specify exactly your timing, but let me take the first shot at answering for you. The pipeline we'll build, I think as we alluded to in the comments, we ramped up our activity in the December quarter, particularly given the acquisition of Liazon and that clarity as to the platform and the market approach. So activity is strong. Interest is strong, as we said. As we've discussed for the Retiree exchange, given the predominance of fall enrollment periods, the sales season goes into the middle of the summer. We will have some sense as the next several months go by in how the pipeline is building, but I don't think we'll have anything -- real clarity for you on the sales season until late in the summer. And that's all kind of related to the 1/1/15 enrollment period, which I think is what you were focused on.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And overall, could you talk about the capacity that you now have in Exchanges on the private side?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. So maybe to take the big pieces, you didn't differentiate. Again, on the Retiree side, I think as we've been saying, as the years have gone by, as we build successfully for larger enrollment periods, our confidence about execution grows. And certainly, as we sense that the market reception -- the near-term market reception to the product grows, our view of the capacity we need to provide for expands. So we would hope to continue to be in a position for continual expanding enrollment periods. Now I don't have a number for you, hard to quantify, but we are building capacity and have capacity to exceed this year's enrollment period next year or this fall. So -- and the execution against that is all dependent on the sales cycle, obviously. So we feel really good about the leverageability of the platform and our ability to expand capacity for enrollments. On the Active side, you may recall our discussion in -- of the Liazon acquisition that we were building for enrollments in Actives of up to around 1 million participants over the next couple of years. That's really the only general number that we have out there. As has been the case with the build of Exchanges, it's a quarter -- been a quarter-by-quarter story. But the add of the Liazon platform, obviously, is very key to the building of that capacity. So we think we have the capacity for a significant enrollment period in 1/1/15, and we'll go from there.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just last, how should we think about discretionary compensation in the back half of fiscal '14?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, I mean, as you see, I think to characterize the discretionary comp for us, we tend to circle that area of the mid-30% range as a percentage of pre-bonus net operating income. It does vary from quarter to quarter as a result of particular elements or performance. So particularly versus last year, the percentage is lower this quarter because last year we had such a strong performance in the December quarter. And I would expect at this point that, for the year, we'll still be in that mid-30% type range, so without specific numbers for each of the March and June quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Shui.", "Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just so I have this correct, it looks like enrollment on Liazon doubled since you guys did the acquisition. Is that right?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, year-over-year, yes.", "Aida Sukys", "Yes, year-over-year.", "Roger F. Millay", "So they were obviously on -- that didn't just happen starting November 7. I mean, that reflects the trends of growth that they were on.", "Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, right. Can you just talk about how the conversations with Liazon's clients have been going and how retention looks so far?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I mean, it's really, I would say, no different than what we talked about at the time of the acquisition. We anticipated strong relationships. We really focused on that as part of the transition and integration. So the signs continue to look good, and we're enthusiastic and appreciative of the relationships that Liazon has built with the broker network and continue to invest in leveraging that going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Volshteyn.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I've got a question on fees for Retiree plans, and I recall that some of the commission fees declined as the contracts go onto the next year. Is that a material level of decline? Should we be kind of modeling that in for the 2014 year?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I mean, the commissions and the fees earned in the Retiree exchange have a variety of patterns. The predominant pattern is a gradual decrease over 5 to 7 years. It is something that, from a modeling point of view, you do have to consider going out into the out-years. But that is -- the elements that offset that is there are agents onto the platform. And then when there are changes to the enrollment or the purchase, the particular policy that participants are buying, the commission pattern ramps up again. So all in all, it's something that has to be considered and is considered in the growth guidance that we give longer term.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's helpful. And just a couple of maintenance questions. Were there any tax credits in the second quarter?", "Roger F. Millay", "No, no. That was all in the first quarter.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. And what percentage of revenue comes in euro and pounds?", "Roger F. Millay", "Let's see. It's still -- I mean, it's -- the numbers, the old numbers that -- in my head again, not having done it for this quarter, but it's about 1/3 of the revenues that are in our EMEA region. And about 20 -- maybe 2/3 of that 1/3 are in pounds, and the rest predominantly in euros. I mean, there are other, as you might imagine, miscellaneous currencies there. But most -- about 2/3 of it in pounds.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just one more Exchange question before I ask about the rest of the business. But last year, kind of I think as the year progressed, you kind of grew more and more optimistic about the opportunity in Exchange maybe as each quarter went on. As we sit here today and we kind of, I guess, look back over the last 3 months, I'm just trying to look at your comments and understand. Have you continue to grow more optimistic? Is there something -- or is there anything that's giving you a little bit more caution even about what you'll see for 2015 -- the fall enrollment period, I should say?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, I think in general, and I said earlier, it's been a quarter-to-quarter story. And I think the quarter-to-quarter story has been the growth in our enthusiasm, which has been reflected by the growth in our investment in the business. Certainly, and I think it is different for the Retiree exchange than the other parts of OneExchange. Again, the Retiree exchange, I think we've always believed, is a very clear value proposition that's proven in the market. And we expected increased volume, and we're seeing that, and this last period was very significant to that momentum. And as I think I said in my remarks, we expect that enthusiasm in the market and our ability to execute against it to continue growing. So that hasn't changed at all. On the Active side, of course, 1 year ago, that was a more open question, not as established. Our market approach was different than others. And again, reflecting the remarks from what is now only 3 to 6 months ago and the surveys we've done of clients, the reception that we got to the Liazon acquisition, the ensuing market activity that we engaged in late in the December quarter continues to build our enthusiasm. I mean, as again I think we said in the prepared remarks, it's still very difficult to say, okay, here's a specific number for 1/1/15, here's a specific number for 1/1/16. But the value proposition seems quite clear to us, and it seems like the market is getting it, and so we expect a lot of activity in building that business in calendar '14.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. So the comment about expecting accelerating growth more so in '15 and '16 isn't any sign that you've become more uncertain about what this next year will be, and it sounds, in fact, the opposite, that you'll continue?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, I just specified there, it's no reflection of uncertainty in our minds about the value proposition in the product and the investments we're making. The timing is difficult. I mean, we're early in the development of a business, a change in the market. I mean, again, it wasn't that long ago, we just said we were buying Liazon. So in the last couple of months, nothing's changed. It's just -- we're just saying, look, it's difficult to predict timing.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then just I wanted to ask about Talent and Rewards. I know you gave a little color in your prepared remarks, but I guess, basically, it was just -- I think it was at your Analyst Day where you just kind of struck a kind of -- somewhat starkly more positive tone about kind of underlying trends. And then it seems like you saw some choppiness again this quarter pop up. So I guess can you walk through what surprised you relative to that? And I guess, it sounds like your full year guidance hasn't changed, though, for that business, so I guess if you could just revisit it in that context.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, that's right. So, Tim, to your last point, we came into the year expecting mid-single-digit organic growth. We got mid-single-digit organic growth in the first half of the year, and we expect mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year. So from that point of view, the outlook versus what we expressed in Analyst Day hasn't changed. But you're right, things were a little more choppy than we expected between the first quarter and the second quarter. Again, mostly focused -- in fact, pretty much all focused in the RTC part of that business and -- which is historically more choppy because it's more project-driven, didn't get as much activity in the December quarter, but that's not a reflection of the pipeline that we see going forward or a reflection of any diminished outlook for the second half of the year. And it also is impacted by the activity in the Actives exchange, of which the Communications business, which has been a strong part of RTC for the last couple of years, that they had teams focused on the product development and the market approach there.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, that's great. And then just one last question, just more broadly, it seems like still parts of your business, the European operations I guess, if I look at Talent and Rewards, and Risk and Financial Services there are still somewhat of a drag here. But I think more broadly, we're starting to hear in the market about at least a little bit improved market conditions in Europe. I guess at a high level, are you not seeing signs of that? Or are there any underlying tone -- change in tone that demand environment over in Europe starts to feel a little better for some of the more discretionary types of solutions?", "Roger F. Millay", "Europe has been tougher for us in the last couple of quarters. As, again, I think we've pointed out in the remarks, there are puts and takes to that, but our top line numbers for EMEA are softer. I don't really have anything to report that says that as a result of the turn of the economy, that we're seeing any early signs of improvement in pipeline -- project-related pipeline there. But it's really more just kind of tactically, line of business by line of business, kind of reacting to their own particular environment. Of course, the Risk Consulting and Software part of the business, which still is very strong on the Software side, the cycle in the insurance business isn't probably going to move, be as responsive to a change in the overall European outlook. And so I don't think there's a big change, really, as a result of the change in the economy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski.", "Crystal Lu", "This is Crystal Lu in for Mike Zaremski today. My first question is just that you said you had adjusted guidance down not only because of the softness of revenues and margins in 2Q but also because of the investments in the Exchange. What's driving the increased investments? And can you quantify that impact for us? And yes, let's start with that.", "Roger F. Millay", "Sure. Two main things, Crystal. First, again, so when we gave guidance, we hadn't closed on the Liazon acquisition, which has 2 impacts, I think. First, there is dilution related to that underlying business. They were building as well and had an operating loss that we take on just to build the business. But second, with the clarification of the Active exchange growth strategy and the platform, we have an enhanced investment plan overall for Actives exchange, and that's what's encompassed in now we're saying the $0.15 of dilution for Actives exchange. So that didn't -- none of that had taken place as of us giving guidance. Second, though, with the clarification overall of how we're going after things in the Actives market, there are business teams -- and it spans several of our lines of business, there are business teams that are now focused on, given the approach and the platform, building product specifications, market materials, market approach strategies, so there were people who just invested their time and more than we had expected, again, at the time we give guidance, for the first half sales season.", "Crystal Lu", "Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And then going back to the Talent and Rewards segment, following up on previous questions on that, you mentioned that RTC had 11% decline that contributed to the decline in the overall segment. Can you kind of quantify what the Executive Compensation impact was in Europe and if you expect that to continue at the same rate?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. And maybe I'll start with just one other factor that occurs to me relative to the overall guidance, the EPS guidance. The other thing that impacts that is the increase in the severance estimate from $10 million to $15 million. So again, that would be several cents of EPS. I think in the Executive Comp area -- well, so you asked about the 11% decline in RTC and then, I guess, Executive Comp, and I may need you to clarify the RTC piece. But Exec Comp, the predominant driver there was the really strong comparable in Europe last year. Exec Comp does tend to be, I guess, to use the earlier term, a little choppy quarter-to-quarter. And they had a really, really strong period last year, particularly in Europe.", "Aida Sukys", "Yes, and I might just add the fact that, I mean, last year, they had some big special projects because of the focus on especially the financial sector of the Executive Compensation. And so there were a number of projects that have built up, and they actually produced like a 37% revenue increase last year. So we had forecasted that they would be in a decline this year.", "Roger F. Millay", "Crystal, can I ask you, did you have more that you wanted to ask on RTC or...?", "Crystal Lu", "Perhaps, trying to -- I know you said a lot of the subsegments in Talent and Rewards was choppy, but is there any kind of way to help us run rate that forward?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I mean, again, I'd say -- I'll tell you the way we think about it, which is what I said earlier, in assessing momentum in some of these more project-driven businesses, sometimes you do have to step back and look at multi-quarter periods. And really, what we're saying, you take the 11% of growth for Talent and Rewards in the first quarter, and then you take the decline of 3% for this quarter, and it's -- it looks like about a mid-single-digit momentum. That's what we expected for the year, and it's what we expect for the second half of the year. And I do want to mention, in addition to the RTC and the Exec Comp factors that I discussed earlier, the momentum in Data Surveys and Technology continues to be strong. And that's been a steady grower for the first couple quarters, and will continue to support that mid-single-digit growth level in the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "With regards to one very large Retiree client that just went -- that just got enrolled, can you talk a little bit about what you learned during that process? How smooth was it? What's the feedback then? How referenceable do you think they're going to be going forward?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, okay, I really can't talk a lot about specifics between us and a specific client but maybe, Mark, in that context, just talk a little bit more about the last few years of momentum around executing very large enrollment transitions like that. So it was a successful enrollment period, as we said, this past period, the largest we've done. The team continues to at the operating level, develop new operational approaches and concepts, and they did -- for example, for this past enrollment period, they had a new approach to -- in the call center for how you handled calls and had a more segregated approach as far as expertise in fielding calls and then handling specifics of the enrollment. That went well, so that was a good learning. It was something that the team hadn't done before. And I think the other thing that we are seeing with experience is enhanced thinking about how to maintain a consistent employment base and expertise base through the year and dampen some of the volatility of resourcing and cost in that business. So I think, from our point of view, this was -- I think I'd say that the most successful and effective enrollment period that we've had. My sense is we get better every year. But like any growing business, it's never perfect, and you can be better next year. And the team, I mean, I'll have to say it's one thing that's really impressed me with the Extend Health team since they joined us, is that they do have a very strong continuous improvement mentality. They measure their operations very effectively and respond to what they learn. So we're successful and, I think, building for more success going forward.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "That's great. And can I -- it sounds like, from your comments on the Retiree side, if anything, you would expect the enthusiasm -- the potential client enthusiasm and the pipeline there just continues to build with a greater degree of clarity. Is that correct?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. And the only qualification I'd make to that is that, given that this is a business that, on the large client side and, again, would be more of a flow business, I think, in the small- to mid-market that Liazon had set up to service -- but in the large side, you're very focused on some of the larger clients. And we've said since the beginning we'd love to have a few large ones every year. But we're not na\u00efve enough to believe that that's going to happen every year, so there may be some choppiness in the growth. But the market outlook continues to strengthen. I think the market is understanding the value proposition. Again, I think it's very clear. Particularly I say -- I would say as a CFO in generic, not necessarily Towers Watson CFO, the financial offering here and the value-add is significant. And so our sense of and confidence in building a strong pipeline for this business continues to grow.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then on the Active side, I missed the exact number, how many enrollees do we have?", "Roger F. Millay", "That was 45,000.", "Aida Sukys", "For the TAS.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, for Actives. So for OneExchange, Active, the self-insured approach, it was 45,000. Is that...", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. And that's lives or employees or plans?", "Roger F. Millay", "That's lives. And then for Liazon, they have 82,000 -- or we have 82,000.", "Aida Sukys", "Yes, Mark, you may recall that this was our first year introducing the self-insured funds for the large clients. And we had mentioned the fact that we wanted to limit the enrollment just to a few clients, which we did, just to be able to prove out the technology platform and scalability. So I think we've met our expectations on that.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And Liazon has 82,000. And that's compared to what, 1 year ago?", "Aida Sukys", "I don't have that participant number, Mark. We can get that for you at some other time, but...", "Roger F. Millay", "But it's a significant growth, obviously.", "Aida Sukys", "Yes.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay but it's 82,000 lives, correct?", "Aida Sukys", "Right.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then what are you hearing from Liazon's broker network?", "Roger F. Millay", "I mean, again, I -- we talked about it a bit earlier, but we think that transition continues to be very constructive and positive. So... and we'll [indiscernible].", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Is there any way to talk a little bit more about like the number of -- it sounded like one of the impacts this quarter was both within the Benefits H&W segment, as well as some of the communications people within Talent and Rewards. You had some people that were helping out as you're building out OneExchange and so, therefore, weren't billing in terms of the way they normally would. Can you -- is there any rough quantification of those types of numbers -- either people, time or way to think about it?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. So maybe a couple of comments. First, as far as the health and welfare administration team that's part of TAS, certainly they're key to building the Actives exchange business, but, really, we didn't highlight that as an impact for that part of the business this past quarter. But their pipeline is strong as well, and we see that business that's coming over into Exchange Solutions as also a key growth contributor to the new Exchange Solutions segment. A number of people in the Health and Group Benefits practice, as well as in the Communications practice for Talent and Rewards, in addition, again, to the health and welfare administration team and others around the business obviously, Exchange Solutions team members, so the Retiree exchange people. And that whole group came together to focus on building for the -- both the platform, as well as -- and the product, as well as the sales pipeline. So it's hard to say exactly what the impact was, and it's why we said there are a number of factors that are both project momentum, as well as reinvestment in resources, but it's clear that it has -- it had a dampening impact in the quarter.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then with regards to just the pure lump sum de-risking projects, it sounds like that pipeline should rebuild, given where your current funding levels are.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, that's what we expect, Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ato Garrett.", "Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just 2 quick ones. One, looking at your 160,000 Retiree exchange enrollees, just want to confirm that does not include any off-cycle enrollees or any anticipated off-cycle enrollees?", "Roger F. Millay", "No, that's right. It's just the -- that December quarter enrollment period, that's correct.", "Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then looking at your Talent and Rewards business, specifically to the U.S. I was wondering, can you go over some of the drivers that you're seeing there of client demand, specifically if you're seeing anything related to labor market tightness that might be driving results there?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. Again, I guess the economic sensitivity questions for RTC, I mean, that -- I would say that the pipeline outlook is fine. There's not, at this point, any indication of a cyclical tightening uptick driving a lot more business there. But the outlook is fine, and we do expect growth in that part of the business in the second half, but it's not a robust expectation at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So the question I have is the tough comp we all knew about or at least should have known, I guess, I want to inquire about the level of sales resources and training seems to be the second reason for the disappointment. Is there a reason why folks should be selling just OneExchange instead of core services in 95% of your revenues? I mean, if it's -- if the more focused offering that distracts from the core, you need to add resources or training or anything you can do so this doesn't repeat?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, sure. I mean, look, we have to remember that it was only 2 months ago, right? So we are adding resources. We're adding resources in the Health and Group Benefits area that supports, obviously, their historic business. But also the building of OneExchange, we're adding resources. I mean, again, a part of the $0.15 of dilution is adding resources for the building of the Actives exchange. So I think, again, going back, Ashwin, it's a great question. But our approach -- we filled out the platform, our approach was clarified during the quarter, and now we're building towards that. So -- and we will build the appropriate and adequate resources to drive this business forward.", "Aida Sukys", "I might just say that was also -- just for us putting together -- expanding the Exchange Solutions segment in terms of being able to re-shift the focus for Exchange Solutions but also being able to free up and be able to have the other consulting operations focus on their core work.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That makes sense. So the new estimates do include -- so the impact of hiring, training, ramp times, all of it is in there, which is a good thing then. I guess, my second question is it would be helpful if you can lay out, at least in ballpark terms, the level of profitability for -- by quarter, perhaps, what should we expect? Minus 20 goes to what by the time 4 2 [ph] rolls around -- for the collection assets that will be in the reorganized Exchange business?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. So I think I'll answer the last part of your question, assuming that that's really the focus area. So the reason for some of the ambiguity, Ashwin, in us talking about when we'll show you segment results is that we named a leader on February 1 for the new Exchange Solutions segment. But there is reorganization in the underlying business that's required to determine exactly which teams come over, how many individuals, and that we're undergoing that process right now. So until we know that exact profile, we can't give you specific numbers on margins for the segment or anything like that. What I can say is that, one, so stepping back to the key elements of the business that will drive what our margin outlook will be, the Retiree -- our outlook, and this is not a short-term, next quarter or 2 outlook but our outlook for the Retiree exchange is that it would be accretive to overall company margins. We expect the Actives exchange to build, again, to a level of at least company margins, if not accretive. The timing there, of course, a little more difficult to predict at this point. And the health and welfare administration business that's coming over from TAS has been a strong business with good margins as well. So I think the questions that you'll be asking once you see what that segment looks like will be more about what it takes us to build that business and what the implications are for margin, as opposed to any questions about really -- or concerns about underlying margins.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So we should look for an 8-K or you do a call or will it be with the next earnings?", "Roger F. Millay", "Maybe with the next earnings. Again, we've got to reach the conclusions which are targeted to be by April 1 for the organization changes. So...", "Operator", "At this time, there are no additional questions in the audio queue.", "Roger F. Millay", "Okay. Well, thanks very much, everybody, for joining us. And we'll look forward to speaking with you again in May and talk about our third quarter results. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release and slides associated with this call.", "I'll now turn the call over to Dominic.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Welcome, and thank you for joining our quarterly conference call. By now, you've had a chance to read the news release that we put out last night and have a copy of our slides at the ready. With me today are Michael Neborak, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Hearn, our Deputy CEO and Head of Willis Global; Tim Wright, Head of Willis International; and Todd Jones, Head of Willis North America.", "As usual, we will be happy to answer your questions after Mike and I offer our introductory remarks.", "So let me turn to an overview of our results. This quarter we continued making steady progress in growing our top line, delivering 3.7% organic growth, a number that looked even better when given some added context. You know from our press release that we had some revenue recognition adjustments that reduced organic growth in the quarter. So, if you exclude those adjustments, we actually achieved organic growth of 4.8%. We are pleased with that growth as it is on top of the 7.5% we delivered in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Our full year number for organic commissions and fees growth was 4.9%. All of our business contributed well to that performance with global at 5.6%, North America at 4.9% and international at 4.1%. If you exclude those fourth quarter adjustments I just mentioned, organic growth for the year was 5.1%. All-in-all, our associates around the globe did a great job delivering consistent growth in 2013. Our team is hard at work building on that success in 2014 and beyond and we'll talk about some of the things they're doing in that regard later in my remarks.", "Now, specifically on the fourth quarter. Our reported GAAP earnings were $0.37 per diluted share and adjusted earnings were $0.42. That $0.05 difference relates to an increase in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset which Mike will dive into during his remarks. Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.42 compares to $0.45 a year ago. We have to remind you for the last time I'm happy to say that that isn't an apple-to-apples comparison for how we did in the quarter. Had we accrued our bonuses during 2012 instead of amortizing retention awards, those fourth quarter 2012 adjusted earnings would have been $0.07 lower or $0.38 versus the $0.42 we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "Now let's spend a few minutes looking at each of the businesses in some detail. I'll start with Willis North America. North America achieved organic growth and commissions and fees of 5.8% in the fourth quarter and 4.9% for the full year 2013. This was a significant improvement over the previous year which Todd Jones and his team deserve lots of credit. North America has offered its challenges over the years but this is the fifth consecutive quarter of growth in North America. Looking back at 2013, the business has growth very consistently throughout the year.", "Our revenue recognition adjustment increased fourth quarter commissions and fees by approximately $5 million or about 160 basis points of the organic growth. Beyond that, North America's growth was again largely driven by new business wins and also helped by improved retention. Rates during the year remain positive in the fourth quarter and to this early point in 2014, we are seeing a leveling out of rates in North America and even some declines in some areas. We estimate that about 50 basis points of our growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 was attributable to overall rate improvement.", "Growth in North America was well distributed geographically with good results in the metropolitan New York, New Jersey area and the West Atlantic and Midwest regions. We also recorded good growth across a number of industries and practices including financial services, real estate and mergers and acquisitions. We also continued to see good growth in our construction practice. In our Human Capital Practice, organic growth was flat in the fourth quarter, affected in part by seasonality. Having said that, there's a good story evolving with Human Capital & Benefits for Willis.", "With organic growth of nearly 6% in 2013, the Practice performed very well and we are confident about our ability to grow it further. As we discussed with you on the last call, the Willis advantage, our healthcare exchange designed around our midsized corporate plans has attracted interest among current plans and prospects alike. We are now engaged in discussions with about 600 prospects for our exchange of which about half are new to the practice.", "We believe that the opportunity for growth in this business both inside the U.S. and outside is substantial. We recently announced the launch of our Global Human Capital & Benefits Practice under Tim Wright in addition to his Willis International duties. That brings together all of our efforts in this space under one roof. You should expect to see a coordinated global strategy aimed at delivering the very best of Willis to our clients and increasing our share of this large and growing market.", "Let's now move to Willis International. Willis International grew 3% in the fourth quarter bringing organic growth for the full year to 4.1%. However, that doesn't really tell the full story of international's growth this quarter, as a revenue recognition adjustment in China reduced commissions and fees by $15 million. Excluding the impact of that adjustment, international organic growth would have been 510 basis points higher or 8.1%. This was truly an outstanding result from the International team.", "Let me provide a little detail on the region that comprised that business. In Western Europe, we had a very good quarter with high single digit growth driven by strong new business and solid retention. This is a laudable result given the generally weak economic conditions in the countries where we have a big footprint. The positive results were spread across the region with Denmark, Germany and Italy leading the way.", "In Eastern Europe, we recorded low double-digit growth primarily driven by a strong performance in Russia. Latin America grew solidly once again with low double digit organic growth and strong growth in Chile and Venezuela as well as moderate growth in Brazil were drivers in the quarter. Now Asia was down in the quarter due to the adjustment in China that I mentioned earlier. The adjustment aside, however, Asia's underlying performance was very good with strong double-digit growth. A number of businesses in the region performed well with very good results in Hong Kong and Singapore.", "Australasia, which I had the pleasure of visiting in November, had another solid quarter with mid single digit growth and positive results in both Australia and New Zealand. You've heard us talk in the past about challenges we've experienced in Australasia, but I saw firsthand how the team is working to put those issues behind us.", "Finally, in the UK, our business was down very low single digits in the quarter as our effort to reshape that business under David Martin continued. You might have read our recent announcement in which we have combined under David our UK retail operations with our specialties division, which will now come under Willis Global. We expect this powerful combination to drive greater client value and selling opportunities thereby accelerating the performance of our business in the UK.", "Let's now focus on Willis Global which comprises Willis Re, Specialty, Placement and Willis Capital Markets and Advisory. Willis Global recorded organic growth of 1.4% in the fourth quarter and full year growth of 5.6%. We all knew that the fourth quarter was going to be challenging for Global given how Willis Capital Markets and Advisory saw so much of its 2012 deal flow coincidentally come to fruition in the final quarter of that year with over $12 million of revenues.", "As we shared with you before, WCMA is a lumpy business. It has a very healthy pipeline but the timing of the major transactions they work on is not ours to control. So if you exclude WCMA from Global's results, the businesses grew at 4.6%. This was largely driven by the specialty businesses which grew mid single digits on the back of strong growth in property and casualty and construction and financial and executive risks. These results were partially offset by declines in marine and energy and aerospace.", "Willis Re was down very low single digits, in fact it was almost flat in its seasonally smallest quarter. North America and international reinsurance was down slightly partially offset by an increase in specialty reinsurance. The fourth quarter sees few renewals in reinsurance so that rate movement that you read about had minimal impact on the quarter's results. However, we expect that lower rates will bring some varying headwinds in 2014. I would expect that North America property and cat renewing in the second quarter to be most affected. Our first view report which we published in January and which is available on our website offers a detailed discussion on our views of rates in the reinsurance market.", "Looking at our full year 2013 results, I am satisfied with the improvements we've made companywide both financially and operationally which are in line with many of the targets that we laid out at our investor conference in July. We achieved solid mid single digit organic growth across all three of our segments, the first time we've done that since 2006. And while expense growth outpaced revenue growth, we feel good about how and where we deliberately invested in the best people, systems and in positioning our firm for the long term. Importantly, our cash flow from operations grew to more than $560 million.", "As we said in July, it's not our expectation that we hit the targets we set every quarter rather that we achieve it on average over the medium term. All of the changes we put in place in the second half of 2013, changes which we continue to announce and implement are designed to do just that. I also feel very good about the progress we've made on our strategic initiatives. As you saw in our news release yesterday, I discussed some of the important changes we've made, many made since we convened on our last earnings call in November.", "Across the company, our associates can feel the pace quickening. Our clients are beginning to see a more connected Willis serving their needs. We also announced some acquisitions that we believe improve our position in certain markets, acquisitions that we expect will be cash flow generative. And we've also announced divestitures of non-strategic or underperforming assets. These are things we told you we'd do back in July and that work continues.", "Most gratifying to me is the enthusiasm I see with these changes among our clients and throughout the Willis organization. It makes me all the more confident about the direction in which we're heading.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to discuss the rest of the financial results. I'll return later with final comments before turning it over to you for questions.", "Michael K. Neborak", "Thank you, Dominic, and good day, everyone. In reviewing the numbers, all comparisons are made to Q4 2012 and full year 2012 unless otherwise stated. As noted in other earnings calls this year, our change in the compensation policy to bonus accrual distorts the comparison to prior periods' expenses and therefore to prior periods' EPS and operating margin.", "This quarter, that difference was about $15 million or $0.07 per diluted share and 180 basis points of operating margin. I'll walk though those impacts as we go through the numbers. I will also be referring to the slide presentation frequently that we posted to our website.", "As Dominic mentioned, we delivered organic commissions and fees growth of 3.7% across the group. As you can see on Slide 3, North America led the way with 5.8% growth, International grew 3% and Global grew 1.4% in its seasonally slowest quarter. Total organic growth was negatively impacted by 110 basis points from two adjustments we made to conform our revenue recognition policy across the company.", "First, in North America, we adjusted C&F up by $5.3 million. Previously we had accounted for our personalized direct build business on a cash basis because it comprises a large volume of low value policies. However, through better quality underlying data, we are now able to move this to an accrual basis in line with the rest of the group.", "Second, in International, we adjusted C&F down by $14.7 million in China. We have been continuing to recognize revenue on the accepted local GAAP basis used by our China operation since we acquired it. As that business has grown and matured, we have now aligned this revenue recognition to the rest of the group.", "Let me now turn to the financial results for the quarter on Page 4 of the presentation. Our adjusted EPS came in at $0.42 this quarter compared to $0.38 last year after normalizing Q4 2012 with the change in our remuneration policy. On the same basis, operating income was basically flat at $150 million and our adjusted operating margin declined 100 basis points. These results reflect strong operating performance in Willis North America, in International. They also reflect low adjusted tax rate for the group.", "Offsetting these results were lower operating income in Global, higher average shares outstanding and a higher loss from our associates line. Global's performance was impacted by a number of things. First was a change to bonus accounting; second was the lower revenue from Willis Capital Markets which Dominic mentioned.", "Third, was a small decrease in reinsurance revenue; and fourth, were investments in personnel for our reinsurance and placement organizations. For the group in the quarter, foreign exchange movements had a positive one-tenth per share impact on EPS.", "Now let's take a look at some of the metrics for all of 2013 which you can see on Slide 5. Full year results showed solid organic C&F growth of 4.9%. After normalizing 2012 results with a change in compensation policy, adjusted EPS increased to $0.26 to $2.64 from $2.38. On the same basis, operating income grew modestly from $704 million to $730 million. Looking at the adjusted operating margin, it declined 20 basis points to 20%.", "It is important I think to look at our results in this retrospective view which is how we analyze them internally. Seen in this way, we achieved good revenue growth in excess of 5% and EPS growth of approximately 11%. We're mindful, however, that our expenses grew 5.7% on an underlying basis which served to compress our margin by 20 basis points.", "To drill down into the expense numbers in more detail, please turn to Slide 6. Underlying growth in total operating expenses in Q4 was 9.9%. On a like-for-like comparison of our expense base that number shows growth of 7.6% after adjusting for the change in compensation policy. That expense growth was higher than the first three quarters which averaged close to 5%.", "Let me talk for a few minutes about the drivers of that fourth quarter growth. First, salaries and benefits; Slide 7 reminds us of a quarterly impact of changing our compensation policy. As we said before, our S&B expense for all of 2012 would have been $48 million higher had we been accruing for annual cash bonuses as we are doing now instead of amortizing retention awards. The impact for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $15 million.", "Turning to Slide 8, we see that underlying S&B expense increased 10.7% of which 320 basis points spend from the change in remuneration policy. On a like-for-like comparison, underlying S&B expense was up 7.5%. This was above our recent S&B growth which range from 4% to 6% over the past three quarters. The main drivers of that growth you've heard us talk about on recent calls.", "First, a combination of headcount increasing by about 3% since the start of 2013; and second, the impact of annual salary increases and third, the increased production incentives that accompany the growth and commissions and fees that we have been reporting.", "The headcount growth has been strategically directed at regions and products where we see growth opportunities such as emerging and developing markets, reinsurance operations and in placement facilities. Most of the headcount growth came in the second half of the year.", "In addition, beyond the normal growth factors I've mentioned, we've boosted our 401(k) match in North America thereby adding to benefit expenses. In doing that, we accrued a full year increase in the fourth quarter. And like many companies we also incur higher medical costs in North America due to increased claims.", "In International we hired some proven producers in key markets that had sign-on incentives as part of that deal. Add it together, those three items elevated S&B by approximately $10 million or 180 basis points.", "On Slide 9, you'll see the quarterly comparison of our other operating expenses. On an underlying basis, this grew 7.1% in the quarter. The growth of its area was driven primarily by higher professional fees, marketing and business development expenses.", "Depreciation expense for the quarter was $26 million, up from $20 million last year and above recent trends, driven by costs associated with a number of IT projects that came online during the quarter. In addition, we rode off 2 million of unamortized balances of systems and other assets we replaced.", "Recall that our initial expected run rate in depreciation in 2013 was $24 million to $25 million per quarter. As typically happens, some projects were delayed in coming online so the run rate was lower until this quarter. All this activity of course affects our operating margins.", "Looking at them on the apples-to-apples basis that I referred to earlier, the first quarter operating margin was down 50 basis points. The second quarter was flat. The third quarter was up 100 basis points and the fourth quarter was down 100 basis points. The four quarters together resulted in the full year 2013 operating margin being down 20 basis points compared to 2012.", "Looking ahead, we expect quarterly variability again in 2014. While the variability is expected, we are focused squarely on delivering what we laid out last year; 70 basis points of spreads between revenue growth and expense growth on average over the medium term.", "Now on taxes. Reported tax rate this quarter was 29% because we booked a further valuation allowance against our North America deferred tax asset. We established valuation allowance back in Q4 2012 when we recorded a goodwill impairment charge that put our U.S. operations in a three-year cumulative loss position. The impact of that valuation allowance was a higher tax provision of 9 million or $0.05 per share this quarter representing the entire reconciliation between reported and adjusted EPS.", "You should note as we said before that the additional tax expense is non-cash and it will turn around sometime in 2015 as part of the entire valuation allowance which will reverse when North America reports enough income to emerge from a three-year cumulative loss corridor. When that occurs, we will report a lower or even negative full tax expense.", "After adjusting out the impact from the increased valuation allowance, the fourth quarter tax rate was 21% which was in line with our expectations. For 2014 our tax rate should fall between 22% and 24%, but that range is very sensitive to the geographic mix of income.", "It's worth stating again that the quarterly tax rates could vary meaningfully from the full year rate. In 2013 the overall tax rate was 20% on an adjusted basis but the quarterly rate range is low as 19% in Q1 and as high as 24% in Q3.", "Moving now to the associates line. The fourth quarter of 2013 showed a loss of $11 million compared to a loss of $7 million a year ago, but it's slightly better than what we had anticipated at the cost of completing the operational review as Gras Savoye came in a little lower than expected. So, for the full year 2013 the associates line was 0 instead of a full year loss of 1 million to 3 million that we anticipated.", "For 2014 we expect the associates line to return to a profit in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Seasonality of income should be consistent with prior years meaning the majority of Gras Savoye income will be recorded in the first quarter followed by flat in net operational losses in the associates line over the remainder of the year.", "Let me wrap up with some comments on the balance sheet and cash flow. As shown on Slide 10, we ended the fourth quarter with $796 million of cash, up $173 million for September 30 and almost $300 million from last year. Total debt outstanding was 2.3 billion, down slightly from last year. And at year end our $800 million revolver was undrawn.", "Cash generated from operations during 2013 was $561 million, up $36 million from 2012. The fourth quarter contribution to that was $195 million, down slightly from Q4 last year due to changes in working capital. Other points to highlight include our CapEx spend in 2013 was $112 million, down from $135 million in 2012 mostly due to project timing. For 2014 we expect capital expenditures to come in between $120 million and $135 million. Finally, employee option exercises added $155 million to the cash balance in 2013.", "Thanks again for your patience as I walked though these numbers. With that, I'll turn the call back to Dominic.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Thanks, Mike. I want to follow on Mike's conversation about our cash balances. We told you at our investor conference that we're going to use our cash in ways that we think are in the best interest of our shareholders. That could encompass a range of possibilities including investing selectively into the company to drive growth. We did that in 2013 as we made hires and growing businesses and regions and improved our technology and analytics. This is obviously reflected in our expense growth.", "Second, strategic acquisitions. We cautiously did some of that in 2013 and already this year. We expect that to be part of our rhythm. Third, increased dividend. We've increased our dividend now for the past three years, with the increase announced yesterday being our largest since 2006. This indicates the confidence we have in our business strategies and our ability to drive strong cash flow.", "Finally, share buybacks. As you saw in our release, the buyback we announced yesterday is intended to offset the increasing shares outstanding from employee option exercises in 2013. It is our intention that we'll continue this practice moving forward.", "With that, let's now turn to the next part of this call by answering your questions. Operator, may we please begin the Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We do have quite a few questions on the line. Jay Gelb with Barclays, your line is open.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Thank you. Good morning. First, just wanted to touch base on organic revenue growth; 5% for the year. You mentioned a few headwinds largely driven around P&C insurance or reinsurance pricing. I'm thinking the economy recovering could be partially offsetting that, so just trying to get your perspective on whether 5% organic revenue growth is still a decent run rate for the company overall?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Hi, Jay. How are you? Good to hear from you. As you know, we don't give guidance on our major line items. We continue with what we said in July. Our expectations for this company are mid single digit revenue growth and 70 basis points spread to expenses. That's what we said in July and it is still our expectation for the company over the medium term.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then on the positive operating leverage, that's good to hear that you're still upbeat about your ability to achieve that. But if we look at the full year, the adjusted margin actually declined by 20 basis points. So, to what extent is your comfort on the ability to expand margins and keeping in mind we're starting off of a lower than expected base in 2013?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "It's obviously the right question. I'm very comfortable with this. We're focused as you know on driving cash flows and we need to be driving cash flow as a good clip over the medium term. That has to be a combination of steady revenue growth. We simply cannot drive the cash flow we need unless we are growing, as I said, in the mid single digit revenue number on a sustained basis. You don't get the cash flow growth over a sustained period unless you're able to do that. But in order to also do that, mid single digits without some operating leverage does not deliver the cash flow we want. I am very comfortable that we have been deliberately investing. So the expense growth you saw which resulted in a 20 basis points decline in margin for the group over the year is not the result of random expense growth. It is the result of very deliberate decisions we have made to invest in growth for the medium term. And so I'm very comfortable that now that we have a steady revenue momentum and we are investing to continue that revenue momentum that our ability to create that operating leverage is well in place. But obviously seasonally it's hard to prove but I'm very comfortable.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney. Your line is open.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Good morning, Dominic and all. With the 20 basis point decline in year one and I think you articulated 70 bips over five years unevenly or 350 bips by the fifth year. So does that mean you have to do 90 bips a year for four years to catch up or was 2013 a reset year in your mind?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Look, I said \u2013 I don't want to get tied to 70 actually, right. I think we actually said the minimum was 70, right.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Right.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "So we're going to aim to deliver the right growth over the medium term to deliver \u2013 again, what I'm really focused on here, what we all collectively are really focused on which is growing cash flow, okay. And you can do the math, right. If you do the math \u2013 if our revenue growth was to slip, we'd actually have to get an even bigger margin increase and that's why we're so focused on making sure our revenues keep ticking along because if our revenues keep ticking along with the right spread, we can get the performance. So we have to do both and that's why we've been investing for the medium term here. If I were you I wouldn't get very focused on its exactly 70 basis points multiply it by X years and you get the number, right. Obviously, we position that as the number we need to achieve but we're really focused on growing our cash flow. That's the number I want us to see growing every year.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Well, I'm with you on cash flow and moving to that, I was wondering if you could go through sort of the three legs of pension which is sort of what was the balance sheet adjustment year end, what's the funding and changes perspective with roughly 150 million drag it's been over the next three to five years perhaps and is there an EPS pickup from lesser headwind in 2014 from pension?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Mike?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Thank you, Bob. So I'll make a couple of points to address those questions. First, pension funding should be down modestly in 2014 with I think the benefit of good asset returns and higher discount rates more apparent in 2015. And the reason I say that and reason for the delay is that we have to go through a process with the independent trustees in the UK and our funding agreement with the trustees will be renegotiated during 2014. So in 2013 we made cash contributions into our pension plans of about $150 million of which $100 million was related to the UK. So we will see some benefit in 2014 but I would consider it to be modest; again, with the apparent benefit coming more in 2015. And then with respect to the P&L impact from some of the changes that we have going forward, the annual pension expense in 2014 will decrease probably between $5 million and $10 million. And then I think the last point that you \u2013 or the first point that you asked was related to the accumulated or the OCI loss that we have in the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet. The year-over-year change in that was a positive $160 million, so we improved it by $160 million or which $120 million was related to our pension activity.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Thank you for the complete answers.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.", "Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak", "So this actually looks like you had a pretty good quarter when we take everything out. One of the issues that we focused on is growth in the revenues per share concomitant with flat or rising operating margins is a key to stock performance. And we're interested in your outlook given your statement about buying back the added shares to the stock options, does that mean that we might have double digit increases in revenues per share in 2014 if we combine mid single digit growth in revenues with recouping the 5% dilution that we had from fourth quarter to fourth quarter due to shares outstanding?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Well, obviously Tom that slightly depends on what happens with option exercises during 2014. So what I think we've laid out is the process where \u2013 it is our intention to sort of immunize, if you like, the stock creep over time by buying back shares based upon option exercises. Whether we will do that on a concurrent basis or look at the end of each year and decide, okay, we had option exercise of X in 2014 and that means the need to buy that Y in 2015 we need to look into. But we clearly understand \u2013 I mean some of the metrics you were talking about revenues per share obviously EPS, et cetera are affected by our share count. And what we're saying to you I think very clearly is that we do not want as a group to be issuing equity which is obviously the most extensive form of capital that we could issue. We don't want to be issuing equity by charts. If we ever have to issue equity and please do not take that as a prediction that we will, but if we ever want to issue, we want to do that on a deliberate basis rather than having it drip out year-by-year by accident or by the exercising options. So that's how we think about that.", "Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I guess the one thing I'm trying to reconcile a bit, I mean I guess the idea that revenues grow faster than expenses we'll expand margin. I mean that makes sense. But it looks like this quarter you invested for growth which weighed on margins. And so I'm just trying to understand as you \u2013 is that something you expect to do whether it's hiring people or paying upfront bonuses to bring teams on or whether that is, how should we think about margin improvement if that activity continues? Does that mean it's a matter of you reaching scale in these particular initiatives for that margin improvement to kind of follow through?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Mike, that's an excellent question because if we were to tell you that we were planning to continue to invest in hiring people ahead of revenues forever, that would be a bad in terms of what happened to our margins. We said very clearly that each \u2013 you have to look over the medium term and this particular quarter we had a serious of investments which I think Mike laid out in some detail in particular businesses. But obviously we hope they will drive is our plan that they will continue to grow revenue growth and that we will be able to manage our expenses. That's our plan while continuing to invest or manage our expenses to create a gap over the medium term of those sort of 70 basis points per annum average that we've talked about. So we got pretty cognizant that a growth policy which repeated the fourth quarter of 2013 on an ongoing basis would produce a very unpleasant result over time. So we fully understand that.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So how should we think then about like a payback period if that's the rate, because it sounds like that's how we should maybe think about it is you will occasionally make investments where you see some greenfield opportunity or some runway for improvement, you'll do your ROI math, you'll make the investment and then you'll kind of look to see that growth fall off? How should we think about that return period for investments that you made this quarter, for example?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "I would like to be able to tell you that it's an investment like some big project building a bridge for a city or something and here's the return, the result of multiple investments. By the way we've been investing throughout 2013. We just had a serious of negotiations with opportunities come to fruition in the fourth quarter, in a sort of clump if you like. But we are investing throughout 2013 and we will continue to invest throughout 2014. The trick of course is to be able to free up other expenses so that we have space for those investments and that's what we're obviously focused on, making sure that as we invest in new capabilities, new analytics, new systems, new teams, we're also taking costs out of the in-stored based to free up space for those investments. So, if I were you I wouldn't think about it over the blip in investment in a quarter what's the payback. This is a continuous investment in our client facing capabilities and we are obviously looking very hard at taking cost out of the rest of the organization to create productivity improvements to allow us to make those investments.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. Thank you. And then just any update on Gras Savoye or could we get an update also on just kind of the operating performance that they experienced this quarter? Thanks.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Yes, I mean on Gras Savoye generally, people are very pleased with the progress Gras Savoye is making. As you heard from Mike, they have now completed the operational review and made some very important changes in their operating model and their expense base. That is done. And we are therefore focused on assisting them and helping them grow the top line so that when we come to make our decision, which as you know, is really the spring of next year, we want to be looking at not only a more productive but also a growing asset. If we are to make that decision and it fully becomes a member of the Willis family, we will obviously hope to be able to rev up that revenue growth even more because we'll really be able to work with them as a member of the family. And that would be the case for the investment. But we definitely are very pleased with the progress that Gras Savoye made in 2013 completely on target in terms of the cost restructuring and now that team is focused on taking that more productive base and growing the revenues in their core markets, as you know, obviously France, the fixed market, insurance market in the world, in Africa, in the Middle East and parts of Eastern Europe and one or two assets in Asia. And we are obviously trying to help them do that.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thank you very much. Good morning. Can you give us a little insight into how Global is shaping up for the first quarter, reinsurance given the puts and takes there? How is organic perhaps trending? And then in the capital markets business, how is the backlog and the tone of business there?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Let me hand it over to Steve Hearn, the head of our Global business to talk about that.", "Steven P. Hearn", "Thanks, Dominic. Hi, Mark. I guess the question is partly what happened in Q4 in terms of Willis Re and is that going to continue. I think as Mike said quite clearly we had a small decrease in our reinsurance revenue. In fact Q4 is very much our smallest quarter for Willis Re with just over 10% of our annual revenue. We're very dominant in international reinsurance markets that I'm sure you know which makes Q1 a particularly big quarter for us and Q2 quite a large quarter. We actually had a very good Q4 in 2012 for Willis Re, so we have that issue as well in terms of '13. So down a tiny bit of money in Q4. Full year we again smashed our two peer competitors in terms of growth rate and margin, so we had a great year in Willis Re. And frankly I see nothing different in terms of where we move forward. Dominic repeated we don't give forward-looking guidance, but we do see our continued strong performance from Willis Re. I'm guessing that probably in your questions where is impact of new capital and maybe what's happening there and what impact will that have on the rating environment? It will have an impact on the rating environment. It certainly is a headwind at one level and it is having an impact. We've seen that 11 [ph], refer you as we said to the west side to get more details of the first few from our reinsurance colleagues. But several whole hosts of other things impacting the reinsurance world, an absence of significant reinsured losses obviously being the most critical but interest rates, economic growth, M&A and fundamentally lots of higher retentions from insurers but it's also an enabler for us. Clients need advice when insurers are retaining more, they often look to be intermediary, particularly the analytical and consultative reinsurance broker to help them and we're very well placed in that regard. So we feel good about Willis Re. Second question in terms of capital markets, I've categorized Q4 '12 as great and Q4 '13 was good in fact above our budget. But as we keep saying Willis Capital Markets is a lumpy business. That is a lumpy sector and a lumpy business. So yes, of course some of the pipeline that we might have hoped would turn up in Q4 we hoped would turn up in Q1 and moving forward, but we can't be certain of that. We are absolutely doing everything we can to maximize what is a very strong pipeline, so we feel very good about that business in the future.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thanks for that color. On the flat Human Capital performance in the fourth quarter, was that new business, rates, retention? What accounted for that?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Let me turn it over to Todd Jones to talk about \u2013 now we're talking about Human Capital in North America specifically, so our Human Capital & Benefits business outside North America continues to grow very nicely. But Todd, why don't you talk about that particular quarter.", "Todd Jones", "Yes. Mark, it was really a function more of sort of the seasonality in that business. I think as we look at where that business is, as Dominic had mentioned, for the full year the 6% organic growth and what we see both in terms of the activity, pipelines and sort of new business that it's generating, we feel great about its prospects in 2014 and got an awful lot accomplished in 2013 to set us up for a good 2014 as well.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Yes, a couple of questions that you talked about, I just want to follow-on on that one. Does the ACA or some of the issues going on there have any impact on your Human Capital business and kind of what's the growth prospects because the clients maybe in a decision in sort of buying and stuff?", "Todd Jones", "Yes, Brian, it absolutely does. I mean Dominic had mentioned \u2013 he gave you some stats around activity for the Willis Advantage which includes our existing client base that are interested in sort of fully understanding the exchange model, not just our model but the models that exist outside of Willis and then the prospect activity obviously has been off the charts. So we've been spending a tremendous amount of time in the education game, I'd say. And then we will continue to see that as an opportunity into 2014. It's clearly as you know a very evolving subject, so I suspect it's going to kind of continue to evolve, I should say, both from the provider side, the carrier side and the intermediary. So, we'll continue to stay poised to try and take advantage of it. We're focused on that mid market segment. I think we got a very unique proposition there and we're excited about where we're heading. But yes, it creates, to your initial question, a tremendous amount of opportunity for sure.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Great, thanks. And then the second question, maybe with respect to investment spending, is it possible to give us kind of what your CapEx budget is for '14?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Yes. I think, Brian, I mentioned on the call between $120 million and $135 million into 2014.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Got you, okay, excellent. Thank you.", "Operator", "Meyer Shields with KBW, your line is open.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. Two quick questions, if I can. One, Mike, you talked earlier about an increased 401(k) match in the fourth quarter that accounted for the full year increase. Should we expect that to be more evenly distributed in 2014?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Yes. It will be distributed evenly in each of the four quarters during 2014, so yes.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. And is that just a North American issue or does it go beyond that?", "Michael K. Neborak", "No, it's a North America issue. It's not only within Todd's business, it also has some indications for our Global business that has a presence in North America as well, but it's more concentrated in our North America retail business.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. And do you have an estimate for what the actual growth in share count is likely to be before the offsetting impact of repurchases?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Well, a lot of that depends on how many options we can exercise during 2014 which we don't know. So to answer your question, we're looking to do basically with \u2013 the share buyback is to reduce the outstanding count by about 5 million shares from where it is today. And then the difference between \u2013 what that result gets and where we end up will relate to the option exercise that take place during 2014 which Dominic mentioned. Our goal is to immunize against those as well, but that would be handled outside of what we announced in the $200 million buyback.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Alex Lopez [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Good morning.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is directed to Steve. Steve, I was wondering if you can give us a progress report on some of the top line initiatives for Global, specifically Global 360, Global Solutions, i.e. catering to the larger accounts and also your cross-sell initiatives.", "Steven P. Hearn", "Okay. Thanks, Alex. And we have others, but I can certainly comment on those three. 360, we have operational on our London specialty portfolio. As you know that's providing additional capacity in terms of London specialty book. We're operating with a carrier at the moment and intend to have other carriers join us, but we have a healthy pipeline of capacity interested in operating specifically on G360 in London and in fact have consideration in terms of extending that capability elsewhere around the world. We're taking our time. We're being very thoughtful in terms of the way that we're going about this. We, as I say, had a healthy supply but we need to be sure it's a sustainable supply and provides positive outcome sustainably for our customer base. So we feel good about where we are and watch this space. We expect further announcements in due course. In terms of Global Solutions which you'll recall is about increasing our penetration of the largest accounts in the world. Not just a feature of Willis Global, it's actually a feature of Willis and they're following the work that we did on strategy last year, the initiation of what we now describe as connecting Willis which is working with Willis International, Willis North America and Willis Global in terms of getting our industry geography and broking colleagues to work much closer together and in turn providing backup outcomes for our customers. And again, I feel very good about where we got to there in terms of progress. We made five global industry appointments of a dozen global product appointments and are now rolling out that strategy around the entire organization, in fact next week in Atlanta we'll be doing it to North American leadership groups. So, good progress there. And your final point I think is cross selling which is something we do every day if we possibly can and again it goes back to that connecting Willis' strategy.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back to the topic of investments versus personnel a little bit. Obviously \u2013 and I don't want to put words in your mouth, a year ago you said that you could add personnel through changing personnel that you wouldn't need to net add personnel to get the scale you need to grow. Is that still the case?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Joshua, thanks for your question. We did add about 3% to our headcount during 2013 very selectively. Now that's a mixture of different things. It is investments in some of our highest margin businesses which you've heard us talk about. It's also we've increased our headcount in Mumbai which is our processing and analytical center we have where we basically have been moving roles from high cost locations into the Mumbai base and that can actually have over time a positive impact on our cost base. So, I had said all along to you that we are a growing company, okay. We need to be a growing company and we're trying to grow our top line by mid single digits. We grew our revenues 5%, we grew our headcount to 3% and my expectation is as we drive our productivity improvements, we will continue to see, as I hope, strong revenue growth and productivity effects which will start to mean we're able to drive that revenue growth without driving the headcount at exactly the same pace. But during the year we grew by 3%. But as I say that's a mixture of multiple different things, many of them hiring key people to drive revenues going forward; others hiring people to enable us to manage our overall expenses. Again, I want to emphasize that our focus is on growing our cash flow every year because that is what we believe drives shareholder value. And so we're very much focused on that metrics.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "I'm totally sympathetic with the cash flow argument, just trying to understand a little better. Should we expect probably to net add personnel in 2014?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "I would not be surprised if we did.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. I appreciate the candid answers. Thank you very much and good luck in the next year.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Thanks very much. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no other questions from the phone lines at this time, sir.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Thanks very much. Thank you very much everybody for taking part in our call.

Parties will be on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. (Operator Instructions). The conference is being recorded. And I'd like to introduce your speaker Mr. Peter Poillon, Director of Investor Relations. ", "Peter R. Poillon ", "Thank you, and welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call, which is being hosted by Dominic Casserley, Chief Executive Officer of Willis Group Holdings. A webcast replay of the call, along with a slide presentation to which we'll be referring can be accessed through our website.

Copies may be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Also please note that certain financial measures we use on the call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release and slides associated with this call.", "I'll now turn the call over to Dominic.", "Dominic J. Casserley", "", "Welcome and thank you for joining us for the conference call. With me today are Michael Neborak, CFO; Steve Hearn, our Deputy CEO and Head of Willis Global; Tim Wright, Head of Willis International; and Todd Jones, Head of Willis North America.", "I know you have a chance to read the news release that we put out last night announcing both our first quarter earnings and our multi-year operation improvement program. After we walk you through those areas in our prepared remarks we will be happy to answer your questions. ", "So let me start with an overview of our first quarter results. We delivered revenue of almost $1.1 billion, up 4.4% from the prior year. Our growth in commissions and fees we reported an organic 4.2% for the group. Over the past six quarters our organic growth has averaged 5.3%. One of the reasons we have sustained this momentum is that we have a portfolio of growth business across Willis Global, Willis North America, and Willis International. Not all may be firing on all cylinders in every quarter, but we have enough diversity in the global portfolio to underpin good organic growth. This quarter Willis International led the way contributing 7.2% organic growth. Willis North America contributed 4.7% and Willis Global came in at 2%. ", "Turning to expenses on an underlining basis total expenses were up about 5.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. While Mike will provide more detailed commentary on expenses later in the call this increase does reflect to a large degree all these growing investments in growth that I just discussed. We are committed to continuing to invest in our growth businesses in emerging markets but would be areas as in [inaudible]. Now with that context we have also identified that these opportunities could significantly step up our operational effectiveness and efficiency. ", "The multiyear operation improvement program we announced yesterday captured our planning for even stronger client service and substantial growth rate. Starting in 2014 and building in 2018 and beyond I\u2019ll give more detail on the program later in the call. Let me turn to our first quarter earnings. Our reported GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share for quarter were $1.35 and $1.36 respectively. Once again those results in this quarter include the negative FX impact equivalent to $0.03 per share in the quarter. This compares to reported EPS of $1.24 and adjusted EPS of $1.46 in the year ago quarter. ", "Now let's spend a few minutes looking at each of the business in some detail and I\u2019ll start with Willis North America. The North American business achieved organic growth in commissions and fees of 4.7% in the first quarter. The majority of North America's growth was again largely driven by new business wins combined with solid --. As we mentioned on our previous earnings call overall we are seeing a leveling out of rates in North America. We saw declines in some products at the top again from specialty lines such as aerospace. But we also saw rate increases in other lines including workers comp, construction, cyber and DNL. However in total rates did not materially impact our growth in the first quarter of 2014. For more in depth view of rates and market dynamics in North America please take a look at our spring updates for market that we published earlier this month. It is available on our website. ", "Looking at North America by region from beginning of the year we re-aligned our business in seven geographic regions Northeast, Atlantic, South, Midwest, West, California and Canada. Growth was well distributed across most of these areas led by strong result in the Midwest and the South. Looking at these results from an industry impacted perspective we saw a good growth across a number of lines. ", "Importantly our two largest North American practices, Construction and human capital both had a good start to the year. The construction sector grew in the low teens with group project revenue in quarter and our human capital practice was up mid-single digits. I\u2019d like to provide an update on our healthcare exchange strategy which includes our own exchange offerings or Willis Advantage. We now have 16 currency and commission exchange branches in total and four of these are new to Willis. We continue to attract business from clients and prospects alike. We are now engaged in discussion with over 750 prospects of which about half are new to the capital practice. You'll remember when we last talk to you that by final is about 600. ", "For a company to decide to move to an exchange is a big decision and involves many months of work by their HR department and [appear] to communication stuff. So turning prospect into plan naturally takes time. So we are really pleased with our progress and our pipeline in this important growth area. ", "Let's now move to Willis International, our international operation grew 7.2% in the first quarter with most of the growth coming from the emerging and developing markets. Let me provide a little detail in the regions that comprise our international business. In Western Europe we saw modest growth driven by new business as well as potential. We're pleased with our ability to continue to grow in Western Europe given the generally weak economic conditions that persist in many of these countries. ", "Our growth was spread across the region with strong results from Iberia, Italy and Sweden. In Eastern Europe we recorded low double-digit growth, primarily driven by strong performance in Russia. Latin America delivered low teens growth. Most of the countries in the region continued to do well with strong growth in Brazil and excellent performances coming from many of the other countries including Venezuela, Argentina, Chile and Mexico. Asia also had a great report. Strong results in China and Hong Kong. Australasia was down by less than 1% with growth in New Zealand offset by a decline in Australia. ", "Let's now turn to Willis Global which comprises Willis Re, Global Insurance, Specialty, Risk and Willis Capital Markets and Advisory. This is the first quarter in which our UK retail operations are being reported within Willis Global following the combination early this year of our Willis UK and Global specialty businesses in a new unit called Global Insurance. Willis Global reported organic growth of 2% in the quarter reflecting the blend of different results across this new set of businesses. The reinsurance business had another excellent quarter growing high single digits in a seasonally large quarter and on top of good growth in the first quarter of last year. Excellent results in our specialty reinsurance division led the way with mid-teens growth on the back of strong new business wins. ", "North America reinsurance was up mid-single digits also on the back of new business wins. Our international reinsurance was down slightly. We've noted a continuation in the trends with softening reinsurance rates across all the all classes of business and geographies and we're feeling the impact of these rates to a degree. But as the analytical broker we're helping to guide our clients through a maze of complex decisions in an evolving market. With our help our clients are achieving substantial savings in the cost of their reinsurance protection and some are taking advantage of market opportunity to buy more cover. ", "For a further discussion of reinsurance rates globally I referenced our updated first report that we published on April 1st. You can find it on our website. ", "Moving on to our global insurance business, it was down high single-digits reflecting a disappointing quarter for both the UK reinsurance business and parts of our global specialty business. Among the specialties businesses marine and aerospace continue to be hampered by challenging market conditions and some negative timing of revenues that we expect will come in later in the year. Within our construction, property and casualty business we saw less project related new business in the current quarter compared to last year. ", "This is simply due to the nature of this business, its result and [inaudible]. In our UK retail business weaker performance was driven by a variety of factors. These included revenue timing effect and lower levels of new business for example in our corporate business and reflecting the improving UK economy in our installed businesses.", "At the beginning of the year we started the process of combining our specialty and retail operations in UK under one. We're confident that overtime this combination will enable us to deliver in market leading competition for our customers and drive good growth. ", "So overall we achieved solid 4.2% organic growth continuing the trend you had seen from us for the previous five quarters. Despite some areas of softness but we're actively tackling. With that I'll turn it over to Mike to discuss the rest of the financial results before coming back to you to talk to you about our operational improvement program and then moving to Q&A. ", "Michael K. Neborak ", "Thank you, Dominic and good day, everyone. I'll be referring frequently to the slide presentation posted to our website. I'd like to begin on slide three which summarizes the financial reporting changes we made at the beginning of 2014. The most significant change was combining our UK retail business which previously formed part of our international segment with our UK specialties businesses to form a new unit called Global Insurance within the Willis Global segment. I also want to highlight the movement of revaluation FX along with gains and losses on disposals out of operating expenses to a new line item below operating income called other income and expense. ", "For 2013 and 2012 we moved $22 million and $16 million respectively from net gains into the new line item. And for 2011 we moved net gains into the new line item and for 2011 we moved $5 million to net loss. ", "Now let me turn to the financial results for the quarter on slide four, which shows adjusted operating income of $326 million, basically flat when compared to the year ago number, and adjusted EPS of $1.36 down $0.10 from first quarter of last year. Please note however that three items negatively impacted EPS compared to last year. First, FX grew EPS this quarter by $0.03 while a higher share count, the higher tax rate each lowered EPS by $0.05.", "Slide five shows 4.2% organic C&F growth broken out by segment. Dominic will provide the color on each of those segments, but let me highlight a carryover impact from the fourth quarter of last year. Recall, that last quarter our organic commission fee growth was constrained by a revenue recognition adjustment in China. Essentially revenue that was reported in the fourth quarter of last year under previous revenue recognition policy has been pushed to future period. That situation is now starting to reverse with a positive impact approximately $6 million to our current quarter. Removing the positive impact, International organic growth was still very good at 4.7% and the group's organic growth would have been about 60 basis points lower at 3.6%.", "Let\u2019s turn to expenses starting on slide six. Dominic mentioned earlier that the underlying growth in total operating expenses which excludes impact of the expense reduction charge incurred in the first quarter of last year and the negative impact of foreign exchange in the current quarter with 5.5%. ", "This is broadly consistent with the underlying expense growth we have seen over the last six consecutive quarters. I want to talk about the drivers of that growth in the current quarter then Dominic will discuss the operational improvement program and how we expect that program will affect cost base going forward.", "First, salaries and benefit which accounts for about 75% of our total operating expenses. Slide seven shows that underlying S&P expenses increased by 5%. This was slightly better than the 5.6% growth we saw for the full year 2013. The main drivers of that growth are similar to what you heard us talk about in recent calls.", "First, headcount, which is up about 3% from the year ago. And second, the impact of annual salary increases. The headcount growth has been strategically directed to areas where we see growth opportunities such as emerging and markets of reinsurance, specific business at Global Wealth Solutions of Asia and revenue initiatives such as our connecting movers program.", "Let\u2019s now look at other operating expenses. On slide eight you will see the quarter-on-quarter comparison. On an underlying basis those expenses were up $13 million or 8.7%. This reflects business development costs relating to connecting Willis with other growth opportunities. In addition we have increased spend on systems related projects.", "Depreciation expenses for the quarter was $23 million, up 21 million last year driven by cost associated with the number of IP projects that came online late last year. All of this activity of course affects our operating margin. ", "As you can see on slide nine, the adjusted operating margin declined 140 basis points, to 29.7%. Unfavorable FX accounted for 50 basis points leaving the underlying decline at 90 basis points. Looking at the segment margin North America and international achieved margin expansion this quarter of 290 and 60 basis point respectively. Global\u2019s margin declined 310 basis point driven by relatively low revenue growth, continued investment in the segment and approximately 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange.", "Now on tax, the adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 22% compared to 19% in the year ago quarter. It's worth stating again that the quarterly tax rate [fell] very meaningfully from the full year rate. In 2013, overall adjusted tax rate is 20% but the quarterly rate range is low at 19% in Q1 and is high as 24% in Q3.", "On the associates' line, the largest component of which is Gras Savoye, first quarter 2014 showed a profit of $19 million compared to a profit of $15 million last year. As we stated in our last call we expect the associates line to be profitable in 2014 in a range of $10 million to $15 million, the seasonality of income to be consistent with prior year with a strong first quarter that -- the majority of loss income in the quarter. We expect that to be followed by flat to net operating losses in the associates line over the remainder of the year. ", "Let me wrap up with some comments on the balance sheet and cash flow. As shown on slide 10, we ended the first quarter with $734 million of cash, down $62 million from year end but up over $200 million from March 2013. Total debt outstanding at quarter end was $2.3 billion, down slightly from the end of last year. ", "Cash generated from operations this quarter was $5 million down from $39 million last year due to changes in working capital most notably the payment of certain bonuses in March of this year that were paid in April last year. I'd also like to point out that we began repurchasing our stock during the last week of February and we repurchased 904,000 shares in the quarter at a full cost of $38 million. ", "Employee stock option exercises added $43 million to cash in the quarter. And finally unlike prior year we did not draw down from our revolver in the first quarter as cash on hand was sufficient to cover the seasonally high operating cash outflows associated with the payment of annual expenses in March. ", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Dominic.", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Thank you, Mike. As we announced recently John Greene will be succeeding Mike as Group CFO. Hence this will be Mike's last earning call. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the very significant contributions Mike has made over the last four years to the tight financial management of the group, the ongoing improvement of our balance sheet and the continued focus of the financial team on cash flows. Mike has also been a great source of advice and support for me as I've taken up the CEO role. So Mike thank you on behalf of all of us at Willis. ", "Let me now turn to the multi-year operational improvement program we announced with our earnings release last night which I touched on earlier. This program marks a significant step in our continuous pursuit of operational excellence. It is designed to further strengthen our financial capabilities and to deliver substantial savings starting now with annualized savings in our cost base from 2018. ", "Let me start with the financial details and then I'll provide some contextual background of the program. On slide 12 you can see that we expect that the program starting in 2014 will deliver cumulative savings of approximately $420 million through the end of 2017. From 2018 onwards the program results in an annualized reduction in our cost base of around $300 million. To access these efficiencies we plan to take a cumulative charge of $410 million starting in the second quarter of 2014 through to the end of 2017. ", "To the savings associated with the program are expected to offset charge to access them during the life of the program out through the end of 2017. We will then drive significant annual benefit from 2018 and thereafter. We've given indicative phasing on the $420 million of cumulative phasing in 2014 to 2017. We expect modest savings over the remainder of 2014 of about $5 million. Approximately $45 million of savings in 2015, approximately $135 million in 2016 and approximately $235 million in 2017. We expect that about 70% of the savings will come from work force relocation or reduction and 30% from real estate, operations, IT and other changes. These estimated savings are before any potential reinvestment. We expect a majority of savings to be reflected in earnings. ", "Today's announcement follows months of detailed analysis outstanding across all of our operations. As you can see on slide 13 work force location, real estate and technology will be the primary leaders in delivering our targeted efficiency gains. In some areas we're accelerating existing professionals successful initiative, in others we're bringing fresh thinking, endeavor maintaining and improving client service will continue to be at the heart of everything we do. ", "On the subject of location where we see possibly the greatest opportunities we have a track record of successfully operating across time zones from lower cost locations including Mumbai, Ipswich in the UK and Nashville. Further possible sites in Europe and Latin America are under active review. ", "We will now accelerate these successful initiatives to rebalance the footprint of our support function. Our current ratio of employees in higher office locations to employees in lower cost region is about 80:20. We will rebalance that ratio to approximately 60:40 by 2018 by moving at least 3,500 support roles under the current employee population of more than 18,000 into lower cost locations. Now this is a profound change that will take time to perform but it will give us a more effective allocation of people to the right places with the right field to deliver with maximum effectiveness and efficiency for clients. We also anticipate some reduction in support role as we roll our best practices and redevelop our operating percentage. ", "Ensuring we are effective in our use of space is another key focus for us. This is fundamentally about bringing more modern ways of using real estate to Willis, adopting the best practices of peer professional services we can make our real estate more user friendly and reduce its cost. The results of this work will be that we\u2019ll reduce the ratio of seats per employees and average square footage per employee in line with benchmark norms. ", "Finally we will make more effective use of technology by reducing complexity removing duplications and obsolesce across business and geographies and tailoring system more closely to the client needs. We have managed to grow a powerful suite of IT applications but in the past they were developed independently via various businesses. The opportunity here is to reuse and rationalize the space and systems, going forward develop our IT in a fully coordinated way. We are known for the power of our analytics. I want that to be just as much a feature of our operational DNA as it is in the solutions we deliver for client. ", "This program will be overseen by a special working group involving key leaders and shared by our Group Director of Cooperation and Technology David Shalders. We are starting this program with significant experience and track record in the space. Most of the operating committee of the group has significant influence driving program of this nature and of delivering cost savings at Willis. ", "We have a track record of successfully moving roles from higher cost to lower cost locations and of managing those locations ourselves to benchmarks that are in many cases superior to those achieved by the major outsourcing companies. We will communicate openly with our employees throughout the process working hard to toward all those affected as much as possible. We'll report regularly on the progress we are making on the program. We will provide information and realize savings and actual charges in the relevant period and cumulative to date. In addition we will provide data on the underlined drivers of operational change, including the ratio of staff in higher cost to lower locations and as how we are changing the number of seats for employee and average square footage for employee. The savings in-charge estimates of the program reflect what we believe is achievable based on current analysis and judgment. We will track these estimates closely and look to drive greater efficiencies where we see opportunities to reach. ", "Let me now discuss the outcomes for the program which are laid out on slide 14. We see three core benefits, first stepping up on our operational efficiency for the benefit of clients. Second, reducing our operational prospects helping us to continue to invest in growth. And third, contributing to the positive operating leverage which will drive in turn channels. So to summarize it has been a good start for the year, the diversity of our portfolio and our ongoing targeted investments continue to underpin solid organic growth 4.2% this quarter and averaging at 5.3% at the last day. ", "Our stated strategy is sound and we remained confident about and committed to growing revenue faster than expenses over the medium term. The decisive program we announced yesterday fully support by commitment, we will execute with absolute focus against the profits we set and look forward reporting progress in few years. With that operator may we please begin the Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). The first question is from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank ", "Yeah. Good morning everyone. So questions about the strategic plan, the first question is why don't you take an upfront charge that we can overtime analyze whether you're successful in your saving by picking incremental charge as you save it makes it difficult for us to understand the degree to which you're making progress?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Josh I think we actually would try and match the actions with takings to the charges we actually take along the way and if we want to -- very closely. I think it's actually not what we believe but I think it's much better to have transparency on we've taken particular actions in this quarter, they have cost us x and then you can start to track how they -- the savings come. But we feel very strongly that the approach we're taking is actually more transparent and clearer for everyone. ", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank ", "And is this part of the 70 basis points per annum improvement plan or is this an addition?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "So, obviously as we laid out our plan for 70 basis points or more the gap between revenues and costs over the medium-term, we had a range of cost saving actions that we would take over that time. Some of those maybe partly involved in this program but I think we definitely believe that as we've added to our analysis this is an opportunity for additional cost savings. ", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank ", "So while the incremental spend to achieve these plans is going on offset by the savings benefits. Are we going to see over the 2014-2017 period the hopefully the 70 basis points of moderate expansion you've laid out or does that really kick in beginning in 2018?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "We laid out a plan, first it's a good question. We laid out a plan to achieve a 70 basis points or more improvement in revenues and expenses over the medium-term and I'd definitely regard 2014 to 2017 a medium-term that we will be targeting to produce that sort of performance during that long time period. ", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank ", "So just on your -- so we should be seeing incremental margin expansions hopefully about 70 basis points per annum. Simultaneously as you're taking charges and offsetting them for this operational efficiency?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Josh I am going to repeat what I said, which is that we set a target in July last year of improving our operating margin on average over the medium-term of about 70 basis points between revenues and costs. We remain committed to achieving that and we believe that the operational improvement program both underpinned our ability to do that and gives us the opportunity to exceed that target. ", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank ", "Yeah. But the point I would make that if it's happening to savings and then we expect another $300 million in 2018 that would be about 210 basis points over the next three years plus a much, much bigger lump sum in 2018 I guess is that the right way to think about it?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Well as you know we don't give medium term guidance exactly on how revenues and costs are going to sort of flow. But what I think we can and we've also said there is some element of savings we're achieving on the program that we may put towards reinvestment to further drive growth but have made clear that we think majority of the savings will fall to the bottom-line. So I think the way to think about this, as I said this earlier too is that we expect over the medium term to be meeting the commitment we made in the middle of 2013 and as this program that helps underpin that and drive further improvement over the medium and longer-term. ", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, well good luck with the program. And I look forward to further updates. ", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery Scott ", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "Gentlemen let me echo your positive comments about Mike, I have enjoyed working with you over the last 20 years and you're a real pro and I'll really wish you well and hope we can work with you again in the future, Mike. ", "Michael K. Neborak ", "Thank you, Bob.", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Thank you. ", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Dominic maybe looking at Joshua's question little bit differently. How does this financial, this operational plan affect the cash flow dynamics. Now I've been under the impression that cash flow was going to grow faster than operating earning with capital spending and pension sort of flattish to declining. Does this change that dynamics?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "No, I think Bob you've got the analysis right. As we've said back in July we do believe that we have the opportunity to grow cash flow faster than operating profits because some of our CapEx and pension contributions we believe will be flat while we continue to grow the company and that we continue to believe. I think the impact of the program on cash flow is really through what it does to operating profits is that we expect as we said between now and the end of 2017 that the charges we take and the improvements to profit will basically be a loss. So may be some slight timing difference between those two things and we will give you a further update on that later in the year. But nor do we see them being a loss but quarter to quarter there might be slight differentials.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "And how much was the change in incentive comp timing from Q2 to Q1? How much of that?", "Michael K. Neborak", "In terms of the cash flow for the first quarter so that was basically the entirety of the change between the $5 million and the $39 million that I cited. ", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "So cash flow is running neutral even though the earnings were a little bit behind?", "Michael K. Neborak", "Yeah.", "Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott ", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Chris Gallant from Nomura. ", "Chris Gallant - Nomura", "Morning. I wanted to ask about some of the changes that have been announced over the last couple of months in terms of staffing changes and incidentally want to echo Bob\u2019s comments that Mike you have done great work in the U.S. and good luck going ahead. But Dominic I\u2019d like to know more about the new CFO, what qualities were you looking for in the person you hired? And then sort of within the manager ranks you saw a number of changes announced during the quarter as well and I was wondering if you could highlight some of those?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "So let me talk about John Greene. John comes to us from an experience in GE and was recently at HSBC. The qualities I was looking for well obviously many of those qualities is that we have in our existing CFO. John also comes with significant global experience having operated around the world and also I was looking for -- can achieve [inaudible] drive and monitor operational improvement and from his background John brings that to us too.

Hearn", "", "Thanks Dominic yes. David's been with us over a year now, recruited in initially to run the UK retail operations as you recall from previous comment we talked together on retail business and our global specialty business in new unit to someone [inaudible] global insurer. And we have got David running that operations and combined for P&L for us which makes [inaudible] of Willis Limited entity to regulate sensitivity and so felt it appropriate to make some changes, a very little coming to replace needs regulatory approval as the CEO of Willis Limited working with our board in terms having -- I think there is some significant changes. ", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Yeah. But do you think of any others you want to -- out?", "Chris Gallant - Nomura", "No, I think I saw some there were some hires in the healthcare practices as well and just more additions to high profile hires you\u2019ve made. ", "Dominic J. Casserley", "", "Yeah and then I mean I think what we can say generically, that we are committed to I think Willis to grow and drive our business. We do believe about Willis it's a very exciting platform for talents across both property and casualty and our human capital and benefits activities. And we are having interesting discussions with a number of people who see the growth opportunity with us. That is certainly true, the number of incoming calls we are getting from professionals in those areas who are noticing what we are doing and are interested in joining us is significant and we are very excited about it.

Wright", "Thank you Dominic. And as you know we have substantial human capital benefits practice both the North America and around the world and that is a growing business, it's growing at a good rate and it's an area of focus for us going forward. We're bringing that -- in action with metrics into the geographies and we're making a number of important hires across that process including in Europe and our multinational capital benefits business which may affect us. ", "Chris Gallant - Nomura", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs ", "Thanks. Dominic could you, I mean it seems that you kind of purposely didn't lay out the timing of the expenses you kind of -- the concurrence of cost as opposed to the cost saves. Can you talk about the thought process around that and wouldn't you expect those expenses to come through, do you expect that timing to be up ahead of the saves or more concurrent? Thanks. ", "Dominic J. Casserley", "That's a good question. And we do plan probably on our October call to give you an update on that -- on our view on the timing of the charges we would take. I think broadly as I said we see the timing to be close to the savings but we wanted to give you more detail on that October call. And I think it will be -- know you're right there maybe some slightly early you take charge and you see the savings a little later.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs", "Understood. ", "Dominic J. Casserley", "We will give you more and more information on that call. ", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. And then in terms of the expenses is that related to current costs or projected costs. Like what is the base line for those saves, so is it I think you have some growth initiatives internationally so I imagined your projections would call for some growth in expenses in those areas as well. So is that 420 is that relative to the starting point of expenses today the 3ish billion today or is it in comparison to projected expenses in forward periods? Thanks. ", "Dominic J. Casserley", "Maybe the easier number to focus on is annualized base 300 in 2018, right. That is a number again all of you we projected essentially would be in 2018. So it is a reduction against that so to say. ", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So it's a -- we should be thinking about these expenses relative to projected expenses not necessarily current expenses?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "That is correct.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Paul Newsome from Sandler O Neil. ", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O Neil", "", "Sort of the related question. When you think about these payoffs timing obviously there is big restructuring charges -- four year payout return. When you look at these other investments are you thinking in the same manner that full year kind of time frame it's roughly speaking the kind of payback for the investments that you're making particularly in the -- that you're talking about they could offset some of these current savings off the bigger structure?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "No, no. I think the first of all let me just go through the cost savings number quickly again for you. We see the -- rapid, so that's why we're saying that we will take a charge and we will start to see savings in those -- awashed through of course 2014 to 2017. In terms of other investments we make which are almost overwhelmingly in client facing activities, new businesses et cetera. The returns are obviously also faster than that. In some businesses we take we hire people and they join us and their impact can be positive in year -- it can be positive in year. ", "In most cases when we hire people we would expect them to be definitely positive in year two, definitely positive in year two. So that the return on building new businesses and hiring capabilities we tend to find it reasonably rapid. As I should say in some cases very rapid indeed but we definitely look to see as we build businesses to see returns in the year after we're invested. ", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O Neil", "And are any of these cost savings depended upon the achievement of the certain level of organic growth in benefit with scale?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "No, no. These -- we've a reasonably scaled business today. We -- I should go back and reiterate we have spent month developing this business in great details and it is based upon specific action we see in the location of our staff, in the evolving the evolution of our real estate base and in consolidating and rationalizing some right IT. Those are actions which are based upon the days cost based and then that\u2019s the way we see it growing and we are not relying upon further growth or further economies of scale to achieve the base. ", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O Neil", "Well thank you. And best of luck to Mike as well.", "Michael K. Neborak", "Thanks Paul", "Operator", "Are we ready for the next question?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Yeah.", "Operator", "The next question is from Meyer Shields from USA. ", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. This is probably more numeric then you may want to answer. But is there anyway finding how much the $300 million of full year run rate savings are already contemplated in the 70 point revenue [interest]?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "It's a good question and it's obviously a reiteration of I think Josh's question right up front. And the answer as I think our friend reiterates again. We are committed over the medium term that includes medium term 2015 to the 70 points or more gap between revenues and expenses. This program both underpins our confidence in that program and our ability to hit those targets and our ability to deliver 70 points or lower. Now that\u2019s how we see this program. ", "The exact division between how much of this is helping us get to 70 and how much will push us beyond 70, it's hard to say and definitely by the time you get to 2018 because the world have evolved but we absolutely say that this should both underpin the 70 points commitment and help us to exceed it as we move forward. ", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. I understand. Similar question now, in terms of the majority of the savings going to the bottom line rather than we invested, can we if you could define what the majority means?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Yeah we will give you guidance along that along the way of the program obviously as you would expect and as you would want us to do. That will be based upon the attractiveness of investments along the way. But we do believe that the majority of the savings will flow to the bottom line. But if obviously you would want to do it would be wide in 2016-2017 resource specific investment opportunities with spectacular returns. If we should be investing in those we will do so but we absolutely believe that the majority of these savings will fall to earnings. ", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "That\u2019s great if you could refer you to maybe [inaudible] that will be great.", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "We completely hear you and as I said we are committed to both providing you on a regular basis how the business how the program is evolving and provide you with underpinning of the key drivers of those savings so that you can see that they are really happening on the ground so we will report to you on this in how the 80:20 higher cost to lower cost ratio where our people fit evolves every time an we will report to when how our real estate platform is also.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Fantastic, thanks very much. ", "Operator", "The next question is from [John Campbell] from Stevens Incorporated. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Thanks guys. First question here just it follows in line with the Josh question earlier and Dominic I know you guys don't give medium term guidance and outlook of that. And just looking beyond that 70 bps medium term goal, factoring in the cost reduction plan and I guess you know you would assumed kind of steady growth in here. If you guys just give us a sense or may be just a rough range of what you are kind of targeting for longer term operating margins?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "I am sorry you know we don\u2019t give guidance of that nature. Obviously you can do the math as well as we can. If we deliver a medium term at this point the gap between revenues get extended you would see our margins improve and if we can do better than that in terms of the operational improvement program helping to drive increased cost savings we will do better again. So that\u2019s all I can help you with basically because as you say we don\u2019t give specific guidance of that nature.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay, that\u2019s fair, just looking for a range there. But as you look at the cost reduction plan I don\u2019t know how much detail you can give on us but is any of that plan\u2026?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "No. [inaudible] as you know went through its own program during 2013 and achieved very good savings, a very successful program and saw you all the benefits in the associates line in this first quarter. Assuming that we go ahead with the acquisition of [inaudible] which is you know a decision we've to take next year and we've not made that final decision yet. But assuming that we were to go ahead with that they would be part of us during 2016 and we would obviously start to look during that period the opportunities to involve [inaudible] further in some of the activities we're taking and that may create additional opportunity. But at this point we're not including them in those numbers. ", "", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay. Great, thanks. ", "Operator", "The next question is from [Al Capacino] from Colombia Management. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Hi. Thank you very much. It sounds like a large scale cost savings program of this sort perhaps was not contemplated at the time of the July Investor meeting. And if that's correct I hear what you're saying that this program gives you more confidence in the 70 bps spread and gives you the chance to perhaps exceed that. My question is did you find that some elements either the revenue or the expense management had turned to be more difficult than you had thought a year ago or is that not the correct way to think about this?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "I think that is not the correct way to think about this. When we stood up in July last year and talked about revenue and cost opportunities, we already had some ideas about where we would find some cost savings and by the way we have been taking those activities. The ratio of that we've been continuing to move the people our lower cost locations over the last certain period of time. I was aware and I've become aware and more convinced over the cost opportunities both leading up to July and after July. ", "We were seeking a team that would enable us to drive a very detailed -- program. We're able to hire David Shalders to join us at the tail end of 2013 to help us accelerate our analysis of our cost saving opportunities. And we've been in deep analysis of those opportunities over the last few months and developed a very, very detailed plan of which providing you the headlines on this announcement. ", "So I think what's the best way of thinking about this is that we had some ideas of where we would get cost savings, we saw some opportunities in July. What we've now done is deepened and strengthened our bench to enable us to drive that in great, great detail and in the process of doing so have become even more enthusiastic and raised what we believe are the opportunities. That is the program we're announcing today but it both reflects both thinking leading up to July and then deeper and deeper analysis of the opportunity which leads to this announcement. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "That's very helpful, terrific. And Mike it's been a pleasure meeting with you and working with you over the last few years. ", "Michael K. Neborak", "Thank you, Al. I look forward to seeing you again. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. ", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust ", "Thank you, good morning. The headcount growth of 3% in the quarter was clearly healthy in light of the market opportunity I guess and is there something you see -- is there a land grab out there that you need to keep expanding the staff in order to take advantage of some opportunity or if it fits in some part of your strategic offering and so therefore you can't just sort of start thinking pennies today or you couldn't six months ago that there is some sort of expense drive that is making you I guess I want to increase the expense structure at least in the near medium-term here which you will then taper off in the longer-term but why not to start pinching pennies today?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "So first of all to clarify that the 3% is the year-on-year increase. So it's comparing the first quarter of '14 versus the first quarter of '13. It is also a net number and we've been seeing and basically trying to target our headcount at particular areas where we see growth and holding back on headcount scenarios where we see less growth and less opportunities. So for instance in Asia we've seen headcount grow 11% year-on-year, we ensured it's up 6% year-on-year in other areas we have being reducing our head counts where we see lower growth. ", "So the net number absolutely reflects that, that we see significant opportunity to grow the business and we are going to put our results behind those and we will come back in areas where we see best growth. This operational improvement program enables us to do all that at an accelerated pace and deliver our financial metrics in the way that we like.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust ", "On a separate topic. The human capital business if you are able to land a reasonable number of those exchange prospects, would you expect the human capital growth to accelerate a little bit because of this exchange opportunity?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "So obviously the human capital exchange opportunity we are talking about is in North America and as we emphasize to you we are thinking about our human capital and benefits activities globally as well as North America. Within North America I guess we do particularly as we are finding that the prospect and actually the new plan includes a fair number of people who are either new to Willis, full stop or new to Willis in human capital and benefits in North America. ", "So absolutely as we drive that exchange forward we would expect it to add new clients to our base and therefore drive revenue. So yes we are excited about it, and let me reemphasize what I said back that it takes time to close these transactions because they are a major decision for a company they are changing the healthcare plans of their employees, you don\u2019t do that overnight. So we\u2019ve really started in this in the middle of last year we\u2019ve close 16 to date and we a had a price line of 750 professionals we are having, you can see why we are excited.", "Mark Hughes - SunTrust ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Yeah good morning I have two questions for you. The first one is do the cash outflows with respect to the expense plan here have any impact on share buyback?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "No. We remain committed to sort of the capital allocation plan we laid out in July where we said we\u2019d be looking at organic growth opportunities, inorganic growth opportunities, dividend increases and share repurchases. We delivered on all four of those bases. We delivered organic growth, we\u2019ve done some M&A, we\u2019ve raised our dividends and we started a share repurchase program. And we continue with what we said on our last call that we have a share repurchase plan on the moment targeted at immunizing the impact on share count options and we continue to be committed about that. ", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay great. And then Dominic the second question, so the insurance brokerage industry right now and then I guess it always is it's pretty competitive when it comes to talent in getting good talent. And then each time you kind of go through an expense initiative like you are going through right now can cause some internal pain. So I guess my question for you is that, is there a risk here of any kind of key talent or good kind of client facing people leaving as result of what\u2019s going on here? Or is there something that you are doing to try to prevent that from happening?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Well, it's very good question. And also keep you aware of this we do not believe it is risk that people manage. We are very focused on communications around this plan the consultation with our staff around the plan and the fact that the plan is fundamentally focused on serving our clients better. So once more example of what we are going to do and which is included in the provisions charge laid out to you the $410 million. It is very important to be make any changes to the service of our clients that we\u2019ve parallel run the old process with the new process to make sure that everyone is comfortable, our clients are comfortable with new approaches were even better than the approaches we have today. ", "We have built in substantial amount of parallel running into our plan and there it's a $410 million charge we have applied. So we believe that we will be available for work with our few -- inside [inaudible] but the thing that really drivers their behaviors and excite them to get them out in quarters which is client service and making sure that clients are happy is absolutely going to be taken care of. ", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Great thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kai Pan from Willis.", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley", "It's Kai Pen, good morning, Morgan Stanley. Thank you so much for taking the call and just first a quick math question. Just try to understand the $300 million cost saving. If 70% of that coming from the relocation of those that\u2019s $210 million and you said probably impact about 3,500 supporting those that's average about $60,000 per employee per year. It sounds they sort of took pay cuts given the average salary of $120,000 for your average employee, so I was just wondering is the math right?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Well the math -- math is basically obviously the savings from the delta between the cost of having a role in that higher cost location and the fully loaded cost of that role versus the difference in a lower cost location. There is obviously where you are taking a role to where you are moving it. And if you take a role from some of our highest cost locations and you move it to Mumbai that was the big delta. You move it from a location in North America, Nashville through the delta but it's a smaller delta. ", "The average you have -- you have probably worked out well could be average of all different moves. The basic economics having roles hopefully better designed roles in lower cost locations with lower opening cost than our present. ", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley", "In that light do you expect sort of majority of this impact this 3,500 sort of roles like about 20% of your total employee base to be turned over the next three, four years?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Yes, we do believe two questions. We do believe that the actual impact on our staff to-date will be less significant than it might appear for two reasons. One because there is [maximum] turnover in that base anyway and so therefore managing this process should be easier because of that turnover anyway. And secondly because we're actually obviously going to defer the time of moving these roles it's not all happening at once, it's happening over a course of three years. So therefore we think the actual impact on the current staff in the high cost locations is less than the number might suggest. ", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So lastly on the timing of your margin expansion looks like in most of these savings were kind of back end loaded of this three to four year process. Is that fair to assume that the margin expansion would also being more sort of back end loaded?", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Well as I said there is a number questions about our medium-term commitment. But clearly if we're going to do better than our medium-term commitment of 70 basis points and see more improvement, this program will kick in more aggressively than that implies. ", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Well thank you so much. And good luck to you Mike. ", "Michael K. Neborak", "Thank you, Kai. ", "Operator", "The next question is from [Ronnie Broadman] from Capital Returns. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "I barely know Mike but I am going to say goodbye and good luck anyway since everyone else said. ", "Michael K. Neborak", "Thank you. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Moving off the topic that is your focus on Willis Re which has consistently done fabulous, I had a question obviously we're all aware that the reinsurance business particularly the underwriting side of it has undergone dramatic change, looks like it's here to stay and it's sort of broadening. And obviously there is a knock on effect to the intermediary to your reinsurance brokerage unit. And for the most part it's not really been talked about or a great area of concern from the management and the executive ranks. ", "But I am wondering Dominic what's your view maybe any other unit head there could comment on sort of what's your intermediate or a longer-term view of the reinsurance brokerage business it would seem to me that the sort of securitization is not a great trend for the intermediary but I'd really welcome your input?", "Dominic J. Casserley", "I am having to think hand over to Steven for a second. I am very interested the question about securitization is a good thing coming from the investment banking organization. We've been in the investment field because we do believe that actually there is some interesting analogy to be aware. We are talking to the evolution of capital in the industry, - moving the question about intermediation disintermediation. As an intermediary involved in that we do see plenty of opportunities but it does require us to be -- and be the analyst or provider and help us through our plans. ", "But let me have Steve talk a bit more about what we sees the outlook for us for the reinsurance business. ", "Steven P. Hearn ", "Sure, thanks Dominic. Yeah we did have another great quarter in Willis Re another great quarter for that business performed attractively over the years. And then unquestionably as you say an interesting environment in terms of great team in the reinsurance space and obviously if you include what going on in the long run?", "As I said before on calls before, don\u2019t necessarily drove the conclusion of that you see that impact directly in our reinsurance business' performance. We continue to grow through new business acquisition business from competitors we do have some fee based earnings in term of the larger reinsurance on file and clients. Dominic said in his remark do often take the opportunity to track the rates that are falling more. If I got out of the quarter perhaps after the question with a more longer term view we think -- I think the new capacity that\u2019s coming into the reinsurance will be sustained in my opinion. ", "And I think those who have a prognosis but in the event of a main catastrophic event that with physical capacity might not actually agree with that I think sustained impact and that just becomes a matter of pricing. ", "For us we embrace that and see this is an opportunity as people start to embrace this new capacity and they often need advice and that\u2019s exactly what reinsurance in for me to read all from the gain using the full weaponry of Willis\u2019s global capability including obvious one of Willis aftermarket, that we see as an opportunity in fact great connection between those businesses that vary all the time and shift. Now opportunity if I have to about where our reinsurance business is and the improvements\u2026 ", "Dominic J. Casserley ", "Okay. And I am aware that we have run somewhat over our time. So I think we'll probably kind of bring this call to a close. Let me reiterate what I had said online. We are excited about the revenue momentum that we have -- we had over a number of quarters and had again in this quarter. We are excited about our growth opportunity which we discussed on the goal in a number of areas and about our ability to bet behind those big opportunities and hop back in other areas where we see less growth. And to underpin all this we announced a very important operational improvement program which is months of detailed work to layout where we see opportunities to restructure our cost base. ", "We\u2019ll be led by an experienced team who know how to deliver these programs and we committed reporting back to you on progress in a few quarters. We that thank you very much and we look forward talking to you further. ", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Aida Sukys", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Towers Watson earnings call. I'm here today with John Haley, Towers Watson's Chief Executive Officer and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please refer to our website for this morning's press release. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay via telephone for the next week by dialing 617-801-6888, confirmation number 22806507.

After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call up for your questions.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", " ", "John Haley", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will review our results for the third quarter of 2014 and our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. First, as a reminder, the brokerage business has been reported as discontinued operations in our current financial statements. The sale was finalized on November 6th.", "Last quarter, we announced the expansion of our Exchange Solutions segment, which will combine all of our OneExchange resources as well as the health and welfare administration work under one segment. There's no impact from this action to the FY'14 third quarter reporting we will be discussing today. We anticipate reporting on the newly restructured Exchange Solutions segment as of July 1st to align with the start of FY'15.", "Reported revenues for the quarter were $905 million, an increase of 1% over the prior third quarter reported revenues and up 1% on an organic basis and constant currency basis. Our organic growth rate adjust for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures.", "Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $183 million or 20.2% of revenues. The prior year third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $173 million or 19.3% of revenues. The quarter three FY'14 EBITDA margins continue to expand while absorbing investments in Technology and Administration Solutions, Health and Group Benefits and OneExchange.", "Approximately $6 million of restructuring costs were also incurred this quarter. Discretionary compensation was also adjusted downward for the quarter to align with the operating results. On a broader basis, we continue to focus on streamlining costs across the organization and realigning cost to optimize future growth.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.39, up 19% and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.59, up 10%. Americas revenue growth came in as estimated this quarter, but revenues were softer than expected in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions.", "We continue to believe the underlying business is strong; however we may continue to see slight volatility with project work in the short-term. Roger will provide more specifics of the segments. We continue to be bullish about the progress we are making the private exchange market, but we have market-leading solutions we have recently introduced to the market that I would like to highlight today.", "We recently launched Longitude a patent pending solution to help employers exit retiree medical liabilities without adverse tax or legal consequences. This is a win for both employers and the retirees. We also continue to make progress in establishing our footprint in the global healthcare brokerage business and have already built the framework to go to market in approximately 30 countries. We plan to continue building the infrastructure in many other countries over the next year to address the demand and provide a health care and other benefit solutions for employers around the globe.", "Both of these solutions highlight our strong culture of collaboration and innovation. The development of these solutions required expertise from many different consulting and technology practices, resources from our corporate functions and outside advisors. We don't anticipate these initiatives to impact fiscal year '14 revenues, but we are very pleased with the initial feedback we received from our clients and prospects and anticipate starting to generate returns on these investments in FY'15.", "We are also excited by the continued progress being made with OneExchange offering. We have seen a ramp up off cycle retiree enrollments. We recently signed a partnership agreement with Segal, a premier professional services firm with strong context in the public sector, to help promote the adoption of the retiree exchange in this sector. We continue to see significant interest in the active exchange opportunity and are extremely pleased with the Liazon acquisition.", "Liazon's channel partnerships continue to expand and the opportunities we are seeing in the sales pipeline are greater than expected. The trial of our access exchange services which help move seasonal and part-time employees into the public markets proved to be quite successful as well. We are very proud OneExchange. We have a market-leading solution, which accommodates employers of any size and all of their employee and retiree populations, thus giving us a unique position in the marketplace.", "This is an exciting time for our business and our associates. Several years ago, we set out to advance our innovation efforts as part of our overall growth strategy and we can now see this coming to fruition. We are in the forefront of the buckle on some work in FY'13, and now we are in the forefront of de-risking medical retiree liabilities with Longitude and providing a unique solution for procuring global healthcare and other insured benefits.", "It's also been rewarding for all of us at Towers Watson to help lead the development of private exchange market, which we believe will positively impact the delivery of healthcare benefits in the future.", "Now, let's look at the performance of each of our segments.", "On an organic basis, Benefits was flat, Risk and Financial Services decreased by 3%, Talent and Rewards increased by 3% and Exchange Solutions grew 47%.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $527 million. Benefits segment revenues were flat on a constant currency basis, however we did see growth trending up in each month of the quarter and March results were positive for all lines of business.", "Retirement revenues decreased by 1% on a constant currency basis due to lower than expected consulting activity in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Health and Group Benefits revenues were down by 2% on a constant currency basis. January was a difficult month for Health and Group Benefits, but we did see a number of client wins at the end of the prior quarter and to this quarter.", "We had anticipated these wins would translate into revenue growth in January, but saw a slight pickup in work in February and then revenue growth materialized in March. The organizational expansion of the Exchange Solutions segment announced back in January is winding up and we are seeing the consulting pipeline returning to more normal levels.", "Technology and Administration Solutions revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to new client work in EMEA and the Americas. There has been a significant amount of administration proposal activity in the market recently and we won a number of clients in the last two quarters.", "As a reminder, revenues associated with building administration systems are deferred until the systems are delivered. We experienced some very positive results in the various business lines in the Benefits segment this quarter and may see some continued lumpiness by line of business in the fourth quarter, but overall we feel good about the underlying business and pipeline as we look forward.", "Now, let me turn to Risk and Financial Services. For the quarter, the Risk and Financial Services segment had revenues of $174 million as compared to $177 million for the third quarter of fiscal '13. As forecasted, revenues were down 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by a decrease in Risk Consulting and Software revenue.", "Risk Consulting and Software revenue declined by 4% on a constant currency basis. We had expected a high single-digit decline, but one-time consulting projects were higher than anticipated. Clients are showing more interest in discretionary projects.", "Investment had a 2% constant currency revenue decline led by EMEA. As we mentioned during the last earnings call, this revenue decline comes on top of a very challenging comparable of 13% growth in quarter three of FY'13. The majority of that revenue growth also came from EMEA, from a significant one-time project that was completed in the third quarter of FY'13.", "Client demand and our pipeline remained healthy. We anticipate results will normalize over the course of FY'15 for the RFS segment.", "Turning to Talent and Rewards. For the quarter, the Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $128 million with revenue growth of 3% on a constant currency basis. Data Surveys and Technology revenues increased 11% on a constant currency basis as demand for our proprietary talent management technology, HR software implementation support and compensation benchmarking surveys continues to be strong.", "Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues decreased by 3% on a constant currency basis led by EMEA. It appears the U.K. market may be coming back, but the other countries in EMEA continue to be challenging.", "Executive Compensation revenues were up 4% on a constant currency basis, consulting demand in this business remains solid in the Americas and EMEA. While the revenues were softer than anticipated in Rewards, Talent and Communication in EMEA, we expect overall segment revenue trends to continue into the fourth quarter.", "Lastly, let's move to the Exchange Solutions segment. For the quarter, the Exchange Solutions segment had revenues of $48 million, an increase of 55% on a constant currency basis. As we have discussed in the past, one of the strategic goals for the retiree exchange was to smooth the seasonality of the annual enrollment process. This would enable us to retain our top-performing agents throughout the year, reduce overall cost by keeping a more stable workforce and increase the fiscal year enrollment capacity while not overloading the usual annual enrollment period in November and December.", "I am happy to report that we are making excellent progress towards that goal. While one year doesn't make a trend, we are on track for enrolling more than 50,000 retirees from new clients in off cycle enrollment, which are underway now through October 31, 2014. This is almost three times the off cycle enrollment we experienced last year.", "We have also announced the channel partnership agreement with Segal, a premier professional services firm with many public-sector clients. We are very pleased with this partnership as it will allow us to potentially make inroads into the public sector more effectively.", "Towers Watson will market jointly with Segal resources much the way the Towers Watson and Fidelity partnership works. The first large access exchange enrollment process went very smoothly. Unlike many of our competitors, we do not outsource this technology or enrollment resources.", "While there were some well-publicized bumps with the public exchanges, this gave us the opportunity to improve the scalability of our offering under less than desirable circumstances. We feel confident in reaching out to more than 400 clients, which utilize our retiree exchange and also have pre-65 retirees and know we can provide the outstanding service our clients have come to expect.", "We continue to experience a high level of interest in the active exchanges and the feedback has been positive. We will have an update on the 2015 active enrollments during our August earnings call.", "The sales season for large employers will conclude in late June or early July. The sales season for the Liazon clients is extended by several months as their target market clients are smaller and initializing the enrollment process is much faster than the process required for a large client.", "Liazon has retained all previous broker partners pre-acquisition and has added a number of new broker partners. While it's still early in the sales season, our broker partners have commitments to enroll twice as many lives as compared to this time last year. We are very pleased with the number of opportunities and outstanding proposals.", "Finally, after having worked with the Liazon team for several months since the acquisition, I am pleased to report that the team, the technology and the business model have all exceeded our expectations. We feel even better about the Liazon acquisition now than we did when we purchased it in November. Overall, I feel we have unique offering in OneExchange. It's a win for employers and employees and we remain confident Towers Watson will continue to be a market leader in this space.", "We've experienced pockets of revenue softness in EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions in the third quarter and we were pleased with the overall results in the Americas. I feel confident, the strategic steps we've taken to right size and refocus resources and investment in the areas of growth, have positioned us for continued long-term success.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. While it's been difficult to anticipate the global economic climate and the fluctuations in quarterly pipeline, I agree with John's comments regarding the stability of the business and share his enthusiasm for our various growth initiatives. We have taken on a lot in the past year and are building a solid foundation for future growth.", "Turning to the financial overview, I'll remind you that our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition accounting costs. Also, as a result of our decision to exit the reinsurance brokerage business, we continue to reflect activity related to brokerage as a discontinued operation.", "As noted by John earlier, the expansion of the Exchange Solutions segment did not impact the third quarter report. While much of the segment leadership and staffing transitions have been completed, we expect to start reporting on the expanded Exchange Solutions segment at the beginning of fiscal year '15.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had a 33% NOI margin. They were able to sustain the strong margin level despite several million dollars of investments targeted for the OneExchange active build out, preparing for the new administration implementations and building out of the global health and group benefits platform.", "Benefits also absorbed $4 million of severance costs. Risk and Financial Services had a 30% margin. RFS showed strong profitability with the Risk Consulting and Software business building its margin over last year as a result of their recent restructuring.", "Talent and Rewards had a 9% NOI margin and what is seasonally a softer profitability period for them and Exchange Solutions had a 30% NOI margin while absorbing the planned losses for Liazon this quarter and maintaining higher staffing levels as compared to last year to accommodate off cycle enrollment activity.", "Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter was $99 million. Adjusted net income from continuing operations was $113 million. The tax rate for continuing operations for the quarter was 28%, which is lower than our Q3 guided rate due to a number of one-time discrete items.", "Let's move onto the balance sheet, where I would first like to point out one notable change. As part of Towers Watson's fund of funds business, we introduced two new funds in the second quarter. The accounting requirements dictated at the time that we consolidate in our financial statements the fair value of investments made by our clients and funds managed by us. As we mentioned last quarter, we plan to review the fund of funds product solutions and accounting requirements.", "As of the third quarter, we are no longer required to consolidate the value of these investments. As a reminder, the consolidation had no impact to net income attributable to common stockholders, adjusted EBITDA, total stockholders' equity or free cash flow. However, you do still see in the financial statements some grossed up activity of these funds as they were part of the consolidated financials for a portion of the quarter.", "Looking further at the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. At March 31, we had $592 million in cash available for our use. As of March 31, year-to-date free cash flow was $172 million as compared to free cash flow of $220 million in fiscal '13. The main driver of the year-over-year decrease in free cash flow was the higher discretionary bonus payout in fiscal '14 for fiscal '13 in the absence of the brokerage business.", "As a reminder, free cash flow generally improves through the fiscal year. We continue to expect solid free cash generation for the full-year. We had no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility at the end of the quarter. This quarter, we repurchased $34 million of Towers Watson stock and expect to repurchase shares for a total of approximately $90 million this fiscal year.", "As of March 31st, there was a remaining balance of $89 million of our $150 million open-market purchase program. As a result of the second quarter results, we've updated our fiscal year guidance. Overall, we expect revenues to be approximately $3.45 billion. We are expecting our fiscal '14 adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be within the range of $5.65 to $5.70.", "We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin of the year to be within the range of 19.0% to 19.5%. This guidance includes severance and restructuring costs of around $17 million. Through the third quarter, we've incurred $15 million of severance cost. This guidance also includes approximately $27 million of investments in Technology and Administration Solutions, Health and Group Benefits and OneExchange.", "We incurred $14 million of this investment in the third quarter. We expect the fiscal year '14 income tax rate to be around 28%. This estimate does not include potential tax examinations or other items that could settle in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. For the fiscal year, our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of U.S. $1.62 to the British Pound at an average exchange rate of U.S. $1.36 to the Euro. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 71 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share will continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share.", "Now we will review our fiscal year guidance for the segments. We expect a low single-digit decline in year-over-year constant currency revenue in the Benefits segment. As mentioned previously, the Retirement and Health and Group Benefits lines of business had a difficult January, and while our results continue to trend upward in February and March, and the pipeline appears to be getting stronger, we feel it's prudent to remain cautious in estimating new project work for the June quarter.", "However, we continue to see an increase in work on some projects and believe we will see some uplift in revenues as a result of these projects into fiscal year '15. The Technology and Administration Solutions or TAS line of business has won 6 new health and welfare and pension administration clients. New client implementations for TAS take a few quarters to complete. This implementation work is underway, but GAAP accounting rules dictate that the implementation revenue must be deferred until the systems go live. The NOI margin for Benefits is expected to be in the low 30% range.", "Next, in the Risk and Financial Services segment, we continue to expect constant currency revenue to decline by mid-single digits. The restructuring is complete and the segment has beaten their revenue forecast for the past two quarters, but we see some softness for the fourth quarter pipeline for the life practice in the Americas. We expect the NOI margin percentage to be in the low 20% range.", "In the Talent and Reward segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the low single-digit range. Third quarter results were softer than anticipated and we do not expect to recover the revenue and NOI margin shortfall in the fourth quarter. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low 20% range.", "Finally, in the Exchange Solutions segment, we expect revenue growth of around 80%. We expect the NOI margin to be in the high teens. The change in the NOI guidance includes the projected Liazon operating losses for the second half of the fiscal year. The outlook for the retiree margins has improved slightly.", "As a reminder, Exchange Solutions profitability is seasonally low in the first half of the fiscal year as we incur all the costs of our annual enrollment period in the first half, but only recognized revenue on a monthly basis, starting with the effective date of the policy. In the majority of cases, the policies are effective January 1st.", "However, as we see the off cycle enrollments increase; we should see some moderation in the seasonal NOI margin variation. We still anticipate strong margins, but will most likely not trend the same level as in the second half of fiscal year '13.", "I would like to conclude in saying that while we had some revenue challenges this quarter in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, we have also been able to keep margins strong through disciplined management at all levels of the company.", "We've also made great strides in developing a foundation for long-term growth. The investments we continue to make in OneExchange and other innovative solutions for our clients, certainly speak to our continued thought leadership in the market and our focus on growth.", "Some of these activities, investments may dampen our results from time-to-time, but are necessary to keep our business dynamic. I feel very confident that the underlying business is sound and I'm really pleased with our progress towards our long-term goals.", "Now, I will turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Roger, and now we will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please proceed.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel", "Hi, guys. Thank you very much for taking my questions this morning.", "John Haley", "Good morning, Shlomo.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel", "Good morning. John, just from what you are seeing internationally and I know you have done a lot of travel as well. What do you think is behind some of the project work hold back in EMEA and Asia on the re-scoping as it comes back? I am seeing other companies', unrelated industries, but project type of work actually starting to come back better in Europe. I was wondering is there something in particular about what you guys are doing or something about the specific geographies you can talk to.", "John Haley", "No. I don't think there's anything specific about that. Although, I do think particularly in Talent and Rewards, Shlomo, the general pattern is, when there's an economic downturn of course, we tend to see projects first delayed somewhat and then sometimes a lot of cancellations of the project never get resumed. We see a big pick up in our particular type of work in Talent and Rewards with the economy starts to grow robustly and I think what we've seen so far in EMEA is more mediocre growth. The mediocre growth is, we can see some mediocre type of growth ourselves in the things, but I don't think we will see the really robust growth until the economy becomes a somewhat stronger.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel", "Then just kind of general economic related trends is what you are\u2026", "John Haley", "I think it's just generally. Again, it's the sort of pattern that our industry follows.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel", "Okay. Then just in Exchange Solutions, I mean, they had exceeded the margin targets that you guys put out over there despite some of the things that you talked about having higher headcount and can you talk a little bit about that, because revenue was in line. Is there something that you're doing over there that's particularly tight or restructuring?", "John Haley", "Roger, do you want to?", "Roger Millay", "Yes. I mean, I think maybe a little bit of it is where the investment in the actives exchanges fell, so as we mentioned a good portion of that fell on the benefits segment. I can't think of anything else. I think in Liazon that the spending was post-acquisition was pulled back a bit and that contributed there as well, but it really was about the pattern and kind of location as we were looking at integration and establishing the foundation where the spending fell.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel", "Okay. Then just overall demand on the exchange side, I mean, clearly you guys have been bullish for a while on that and it looks like there's good trends. Are you seeing the trends continuing along the path that you discussed? Last quarter, getting better, getting you know not necessarily is good, just from an underlying demand perspective in terms of indications of interest and potential people getting to deals in the next, say, six months or so?", "John Haley", "Yes. I mean, you know, Shlomo, this is one of the most difficult things we have ever had forecast in the sense there's tremendous interest that employers have about this and we actually feel somewhat more confident about predicting what the pickup in exchanges might be five years from now than we may do one year from now, because we are in the exact path that follow to go whether people will weigh the year to adopt it.", "Since it's broken into these evenly things like the everybody is going to attempt to go January 1st all the time that's where the bulk of them are going to go. It tends to move just abruptly from one year to the next, so I think we still feel very good, we still very bullish, but we just can't give you a projection at the moment as to what even January 1, 2015 is going to look like.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel", "Okay, then just a housekeeping item. In the cash flow statements the cash receipt from consolidated variable interest entities does that have to do with the fund of funds that you were talking about. Is there a\u2026", "John Haley", "Exactly. That's the fund of funds.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. John, you are kind enough to give us commentary about the Liazon sales pipeline. Can you give us any general commentary or specific commentary on active and retiree? Then second, the follow-up on the six new clients in TAS. Do any of those clients have anything to do with your client wins in exchange? Thanks.", "John Haley", "Yes. First, I was dealing with the second first, Paul. No. Those are different clients that we have won. Those are not exchange clients. The selling season is really still underway for even the retirees and the actives for the exchange market. Some of the Liazon ones we've already had the commitments immediately, and while we have had some so far on the other parts of the actives, it's not enough that we feel like there's any kind of a complete picture that we have. We really won't have good information on that until - for the big clients it's the end of June and July, or end of June, beginning of July and the retirees are probably are going to run about the same timeframe.", "Then even from Liazon, where we can compared them to where we were last year at this time, we still have the selling season that's going to extend well into fiscal 2015 for us.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Maybe just ask one more follow-up. As you add to this 50,000 between the fiscal fourth-quarter and fiscal first-quarter, how do those kind of split between the two quarters?", "Roger Millay", "We don't have that.", "John Haley", "We don't have that.", "Roger Millay", "Spread, I mean, it is spread.", "John Haley", "It is spread, but the bulk of it is I think into the next fiscal year, but there's some that will definitely fall in the fourth quarter. We just don't have that unfortunately, Paul.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank", "No problem.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs", "Hi. Good morning. First question, in your press remarks you said that the investment exchanges have been a bigger distraction than expected. In what way is it so a bigger extraction? Are you just having more people working on exchange or is it something else? Given the negative surprise, how should we think about handicap in that going forward?", "Roger Millay", "This is Roger. Hi, Andre. Just to add there, I mean, it's just been difficult to predict given the fairly significant organizational transitions that we've been making the last couple of quarters how that would play out. That was certainly a factor in the December quarter and we knew it would be a factor in the March quarter. Just didn't know how to size it, so again I think the key point that came out in the script is that you we are through a lot of that and are now anticipating much more stable kind of environment going forward.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs", "You said you have made a fair amount of progress on the restructuring. The cost trends have been pretty favorable over the last few quarters. Could you just give some - clearly, you have some of your cost embedded in your guidance for the fourth quarter, but as we think about next year should we see any further steps down? Should we assume that we are pretty flat from here? How should we think about the actual spending levels going forward?", "Roger Millay", "Yes. You know I would just say from my perspective, we do have a lot of work and focus going on, on the cost side and really have for the past 12, 15 months or so. I call it the notable restructuring activities which really we have been targeting talking in these calls, talking about the severance, expected severance levels. That's virtually behind us as I mentioned. There's another $2 million of cost expected in the fourth quarter, but the two larger ones in retirement and RCS are completed, so we will of course get benefits from that going into the September and December and March quarters next year when we are comparing back to periods before those restructurings.", "Otherwise, we do have, we're calling it continuous improvement efforts going on that just continues to target cost tightly and I don't have any numbers, but I would expect that will see some benefit from that next year as well.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair. Please proceed.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "Yes. Thanks. First, Roger, I guess following up on the comment about you will get a benefit next year. I know you probably even budgeted next year, but is it fair for us to think about those costs kind of, if not going away, I guess, revenue offsetting them such that they're not a drag?", "Then, John, maybe long-term, can you give us some sort of perception on kind of the international Health and Group Benefits, brokerage rollout what's kind of a three to five-year target for what type of contribution we might hope to get from that as you scale that up?", "Roger Millay", "I am not sure, Tim. I am sorry, I am not sure I understood your question although perhaps it was around actually the severance costs as a revenue offsetting those costs and so I wasn't saying that we were expecting more severance into next year. I was saying the cost savings that have come in the March and June quarters will give us a benefit in the early quarters next year, because the costs are out and we will be comparing back to year when they were in. Does that help?", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "That's fair. I wasn't sure if you are saying the investment spending you are describing would go away next year.", "Roger Millay", "Okay. Sorry, so now I understand your question. Look, in all the areas, so the areas where and I guess, they were noted broadly in the press release and in the dialogue, but the investment spending related to the level of cost that we are carrying in the retiree business, because we are having success in the off cycle enrollments since smoothing out the enrollment process. That is something that is more of a seasonal cost analysis, so if you look at it then you wouldn't expect if we continue to have success there as you wouldn't expect to have as much of a buildup perhaps relatively in the third and fourth quarter, so that that may be more of a seasonal pattern as opposed to overall cost, but certainly the revenue levels offset those investments in retiree.", "John is going to talk about the global health and group benefits, but that's an investment to drive revenue the future same as the OneExchange active build, so in general again as you say we have not given guidance, but you the investment spending we expect to continue and it's going to drive revenues.", "John Haley", "Yes. First of all, let me just say this, we anticipated a good reaction to the announcement of our global healthcare brokerage business, in fact the strength of the reaction I think surprised us and so we have gotten very good feedback about that. We have not done any estimates of a couple of years out of where we will be. I think, we will be in a position to talk. Clearly, when we give the guidance for next year, we will be talking about what it will be doing for next year, but that will be at Analyst Day in September, we will be in a position then to give you some thoughts about how this might develop over the next few years.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "Okay. Then on the lump sum marketing, I guess, generally the retirement practice. I guess, can you give us a little more color. I guess, it sounds like the pipeline is improving their, but is that usually calendar year end when we will see that? I guess, a little more color in terms of how the pipeline is improving there and when we will see it in the numbers?", "John Haley", "I think that it was certainly the first big spike in the bulk lump sums occurred at a calendar year end and in part that occurred because of the interest arbitrage that we had there. As we look at things this coming year, we are expecting to see them spike up, although not back the levels that we saw at the end of, I guess, it was what? Calendar '12, when we did that.", "We do think, we are going to see an uptick in selling off pension liabilities through annuity purchase or other type of the plan termination capabilities, so we do think annuity purchases are something we are going to see more of in addition to the bulk lump sums.", "The quarter four bulk lump sum revenue that we have, we think is going to be flat to slightly ahead of what was it was in quarter four of FY'13. Then I think, we are probably expecting to see a little bit of the pickup through the end of the year, so we will be doing better on a comparable basis through the end of the calendar year.", "The only other thing I would say, Tim, is just that there's another driver there that I am not sure we factor in, and maybe this may drive things even a little further, which is the PBGC premium increase. The premiums are going to increase by 50% by 2016 and that's going to be another impetus for bulk lump sums.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "Okay. Then the last question I guess just, you were asked about the selling season I guess in terms of the magnitude of the pipeline I know it's still early in the selling season, but what's your perception of the market share competition relative to the RFPs out there? Do you feel any different about what clients are looking for, how your how your products stack up in your ability to, I guess, earn your fair share of the RFPs that are coming on?", "John Haley", "Yes. We feel pretty good about our ability to do that. Now, I think what you might see is there are if organizations convert existing health and welfare administration clients to exchanges may appear that [summer] get a bit of a head start in terms of that, but the vast bulk of them are out there for open competition and we feel pretty good about our chances there.", "Tim McHugh - William Blair", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from SunTrust. Please proceed.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "Thank you. When you help a customer de-risk may be through bulk lump sum or some other mechanism, does your business opportunity for generating revenue working with those pension liabilities decline or are you able to generate some ongoing revenues from that customer still as well as the insurance company or whoever may buy the assets in the case of an outright sale?", "John Haley", "Yes. What happens, Tobey, is when we do the bulk lump sums or we do the annuity purchase with an insurance company or whatever, the liabilities that are associated with that, once we have the transaction all completed, we don't tend to have any further revenues that we get from them.", "Now, there's an enormous spike up in revenues to get the transaction accomplished, but what we find is that the total revenues for the pension plan that the pension plan is still continuing, in particularly in the case of let's say when you are paying off, bulk lump sums and you are cashing out some retirees, you are cashing out terminated vested, you are not really shortening the expected lifetime of the pension plan, so even for a closer frozen plans running on as long as it would have anyway, because you settled the near-term liabilities not longer-term ones and things like doing the annual valuations for accounting purposes or for other regulatory purposes, all of those kinds of things continue.", "In the case of a plan termination of course that's a totally different thing. Then we lose all the revenues associated with that, but we haven't seen much in the way of plan terminations.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "Thank you. Switching gears to the healthcare exchange, I understand that assessing near-term demand when a customer is actually a pull the trigger could be difficult, but given that you need to ramp up licensed insurance agents, I would imagine you have a better handle on your internal capabilities to handle enrollments or kind of throughput, what kind of throughput are you building your capability for this year's enrollment versus last year's?", "John Haley", "Now the retirees or where we need to ramp up with all of the agents and there is I think two things that have been occurring over the years. One is, we have just gotten better every year at ramping up the agents and the amount by which we've expanded things to deal with the enrollment period in October through December, that's gotten bigger every year and I think we have just learned from that and got much better at it.", "Last year, we did over 150,000 retirees and this year we could handle at least that plus more. In addition to the normal way of just being able to handle more and getting better at it each year, we've also had the effect this year of the off cycle enrollments and the off cycle enrollments are absolutely critical to us really having the capability to handle enormous surges, because what the of cycle enrollments do is allow us to keep our most experienced agents, and when we look at productivity, the productivity of the most experienced agents is a couple times that of the newer agents and so that's what really gives us the flexibility and capability.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "Thank you. Regarding off cycle enrollments, is there any change in the pricing structure for those kinds of customers or is it really customers taking advantage of less risky operational periods for enrollment?", "John Haley", "It's the latter. There is no change in the pricing, but they probably get a little more attention than they might otherwise. Certainly, you have the full resources available there.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "Thank you. Last two questions for me. Any expectations for changes to commission rates in the Healthcare Exchange and the various flavors that you offer and do you have an expectation for changes to premiums in 2015? Thank you.", "Roger Millay", "I think, we don't expect really any change in the actives, commissions or anything like that. The OneExchange access, the one where we link up to the public exchanges those are fee-for-services with the possibility of commissions.", "The CMS commissions are expected at 70% of private market commission, so that's the one change we could see there, but that's a relatively small part of the overall exchange business.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "Thank you.", "Roger Millay", "Otherwise in the flow\u2026", "Roger Millay", "John Haley", "Otherwise, I think, broadly the answer is no.", "Roger Millay", "Yes. We don't expect any changes.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Mark Marcon from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Good morning. Your really senior consultants in a number of different practice areas have been going out and talking to a ton of clients on the healthcare exchange. You mentioned earlier, you might feel more confident about giving projections about five years as opposed to one out, just because of the dynamics in terms of the decision processes for the various benefits managers at these companies and what they're trying to consider. As you think about that five-year opportunity, can you refresh us in terms of how you are thinking about that opportunity in terms of the addressable markets? You have given us some stats in the past. I was wondering if you could update that.", "Roger Millay", "Yes. Sure. By the way and first of all I should say it's the decision-making process is somewhat attenuated with the with the benefits folks, but only thing is that when you are thinking about going to exchanges, that's really something that involves the [sea] sweet too and that's what makes the decision a little bit longer and a little bit more uncertain from our point of view as to when it will exactly be made.", "I don't think, when we are dealing with this, it's not an issue about the overall enthusiasm for doing it, but I do think we are a little less certain as to exactly which year it's going to fall into. That really more the issue, but just thinking about five years from now, I mean, I think we have had McKinsey and Accenture both did studies of the market and they came out at about $35 million, $40 million, $45 million, something like that in the five to seven year period. That would be the number of employees on the active exchanges.", "As we think about that, there's about 120 million in private employment in the U.S. and that's where we think the bulk of that will come from in those first five years, so if we take let's say 40 million, 40 million out of 120 million. That's an adoption rate of about a third.", "For employers with more than 100 lives, that's two-thirds of the market, so that's then two-ninths of the market in total there that comes to about 27 million people and if we got a quarter of that, that would be about 6.75 million and we would probably add in some from the less than 100 lives, so maybe 1 million more so, maybe 7.75 million, so I would say 7.5 to 8 million is some kind of a rough estimate.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "7.5 million to 8 million kind of four years out?", "Roger Millay", "Five years out.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Five years out. Okay. Great. Then.", "John Haley", "By the way, let me just be clear, Mark, that assumes that the overall numbers are right for that McKinsey and Accenture have.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Yes.", "John Haley", "Okay.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Then is it your sense that the way things are tracking and the enthusiasm that you are hearing that's that seems approximately to be on track?", "John Haley", "I think those numbers are as reasonable as anything I have seen. I am not sure I would want to sign my name to any specific projection, but those projections are probably as good as anything as I have seen.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Then with regards to the retiree side, you've articulated before out of the 6 million private post 65, 80% plus that still feels a reasonable range, right?", "John Haley", "I'm not sure on the source of an 80%-plus. I do think it's a market that will eventually get reasonably well penetrated, but I am not sure what timeframe it would be to get to 80%. When you think about that, that would have to be a pretty big uptick it to get there over four or five years.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Can you talk a little bit about Segal and what the opportunity is on public side?", "John Haley", "Yes, so they are premier consulting firm in this space. They are very well respected. We have very high regard for them, they are probably the premier player in the public sector space and we are going to be working with them the same way we have to with Fidelity, where we have this partnership and we will go out to market to exchange services. They do the kind of retirement consulting that we do for plans in the U.S. They do it for the public sector.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Got it. Any sense in terms of whether or not that market has the potential to loosen up. I have heard about one's statements probably going to change in addition to the ones you have mentioned in the past?", "John Haley", "I guess, what I would say about the public sector is, I think they are probably generally not going to be the ones who were necessarily jumping right way at doing this. They will probably be a little bit slower to take it up than the private sector, but I think there are terrific opportunity for the future, so I think the exchanges make a lot of sense for rough public sector plans.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Great. Then lastly, can you just talk a little bit about Longitude and how we should think about that impacting both, near-term and longer term revenue?", "John Haley", "I think that's going to be one that we will a lot like I got the question earlier about the global healthcare brokerage and we had said we didn't expect any - and so as a result the margins were a little bit lower and it's back to what we talked about before the pressure in EMEA and Asia.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Fair enough. I know you discussed cost before going into the fiscal year '15, I know you are not giving guidance yet, but how does next year fit in with a longer term growth expectations? Is there anything that has changed from the last few quarters that is altering your outlook on fiscal year '15? Thanks.", "John Haley", "John Haley", "I think the short answer to that is no. Now, as you mentioned, we will be giving guidance for next year in a couple of months, but there has nothing occurred that's we say gees this is something we are going to factor in as we do the guidance, nothing like that.", "Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you guys.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please proceed.", "Phil Stiller - Citi", "Hi, this is Phil Stiller on for Ashwin. I guess, I wanted to start with the discretionary comp. You guys have obviously protected the margins using that lever this year, which is - consistent with what you have done in the past. Just wondering as we think about next year if you return to a more normalized revenue and profit performance, should we expect that payout to snap back up and hit the margins next year?", "John Haley", "Yes. I think when we when we look at the discretionary comp, we tend to have this in the broad range. It's in the high 30% is what we do, and when we are having better years, we try to get that into the very high 30s, closer to 40% and when we have more difficult years, we tend to keep it more down around the 36%, 37% range, so it's not a big swing that we do, but I think when we have better years, we would hope to get closer to the 38% to 39% range.", "Phil Stiller - Citi", "Okay. That's helpful. Then I guess, in the past you guys had mentioned Easter impacting the revenue a bit moved the timing of Easter from the billing day perspective. Just wondering if that had any impact in the third quarter and if that's impact the fourth quarter results or guidance?", "John Haley", "There are a couple of things like that that we decided not to go into. I mean, Easter actually shifted the quarters this year. We actually had our target in the Americas, but frankly we think we could have lost some revenue due to the weather, which really caused quite a number of days that we had are very largest offices closed, but we decided not to try to get into parsing each of those events.", "Phil Stiller - Citi", "Okay. Makes sense. Then the last question, you have obviously had a lot of tax benefits so far this year. Seems like the guidance for the fourth quarter's is back to a more normalized rate, but I know you guys have been working on reducing the tax-free longer term, so is there any update in terms of the longer-term expectations for the tax rate?", "Roger Millay", "I mean, I would say that we have had some success obviously. We continue to work on lowering what the tax rate will be over the next couple or three years and have some visibility to doing that. On the other hand at the moment, we are growing more robustly in the things that we haven't placed for growth in the next couple years are more in the U.S., in a high tax country, so probably this range of 34%-ish is a decent modeling number for right now. Although, again, we hope things fall in place where we can continue to push that down.", "Phil Stiller - Citi", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that is it for the Q&A portion. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Haley for any closing remarks.", "John Haley", "Okay. Thanks very much for joining us this morning and we look forward to reviewing our fourth quarter results with you in August.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that would conclude today's conference.

With me today are John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer; Steve Hearn, our Deputy CEO and Head of Willis Global; Tim Wright, Head of Willis International; and Todd Jones, Head of Willis North America.", "By now you\u2019ve had a chance to read the news release that we put out last night, announcing our third quarter earnings. On this call John and I will give our prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll move to Q&A.", "To begin, I\u2019d like to provide some comments on this quarter\u2019s results, primarily on our organic commissions and fees growth and our underlying expense growth. Through the first half of 2014 we had grown our commissions and fees organically by 4.3%. This quarter growth for the group slowed to 2.5%, which is disappointing as it is below our first half result.", "It is important, however, to get below this headline number to see that the decline is isolated in a few areas and that many of our regions and practices continue to growth well. For example, a theme you will hear across segments is weaker construction practice revenues this quarter. This is the result for timing of project and the fact that last year\u2019s quarter had some significant project revenues that have impacted the current comparison.", "Looking at revenues, on a segment-by-segment basis, Willis International led the way contributing 6.3%. Willis North America added 3.4% and Willis Global, where most of the negative factors were play, came in very slightly down at 0.4%.", "Now let me provide a little more detail of each of the segments internally. First, Willis International. Our international operations grew 6.3% in the quarter, bringing our organic growth rate year-to-date to 6.5%. Once again this is a really strong result from the segment. Latin America and Eastern Europe grew double-digit while Western Europe saw mid single-digit growth in the quarter. Asia was about flat as growth in China and Global Wealth Solutions was offset by a decline in Hong Kong.", "Now, if you think about economic growth rates around the globe, it is clear that Willis International\u2019s organic growth has outpaced the nominal economic growth of many of the geographies in which it operates, that includes both Western Europe and many of the emerging markets. We believe that this is evidence of our strong market position in those international markets and our strategic initiatives to actively invest in the fastest growing market and take share in developed markets.", "On to Willis North America, which continues to generate solid new business while maintaining strong retention levels. As I said, we delivered 3.4% organic growth in North America. We saw mid single-digit organic growth across several of our geographic regions with the Mid-West and Atlantic leading the way.", "Rates in general in North America continue to moderate with of course variances across difference in lines of business. We recently published our market place realities report for those interested in deep dive into our view of 2015 rates in North America. It is available on our website.", "Looking at our results by practice, importantly North America\u2019s largest practice Human Capital grew mid single digits. Now while I\u2019m discussing human capital, let me provide a brief update on our healthcare exchange strategy which includes our own exchange offering The Willis Advantage.", "I believe when we last updated you, we had 16 current and committed exchange plans in total. We now have 31 and that includes Willis in North America and the pipeline remains strong. More than 700 prospect in various stages of discussions. So we remain optimistic about the growth opportunity of this important business.", "Our second largest practice in North America, construction, as I mentioned earlier, with down mid single digits in the quarter as a number of project in the prior year quarter did not recover. That is simply the nature of this project oriented business. Quarter-to-quarter results can be uneven. Importantly, year-to-date this practice is up mid single digits, so it continues to be a growing practice.", "Now on to Willis Global, which is comprises the Willis Re, Willis Insurance UK, Facultative, Risk, and Willis Capital Markets and Advisory. Global to organic commissions and fees decreased by 0.4% in the quarter, this result reflected a blend of difference result across its major component businesses. Willis Re grew low single digits in a seasonally small quarter by continuing to innovatively server our plans and win new business. This was achieved against the backdrop or perhaps the most competitive market condition the reinsurance industry has been in more than a decade.", "Within the reinsurance business, North America grew strongly supported by new business win and International grew modestly. However, the prevailing market conditions took their toll on the specialties reinsurance division which was down modestly in the quarter.", "Moving onto Willis Insurance UK, which combines our UK retail unit and global specialty businesses. Willis Insurance UK declined mid-single digits in the quarter, which the majority of the weakness isolated in the specialty construction business which was also get a very difficult comparison due to large project revenues recorded in last year\u2019s quarter that did not recover. Meanwhile, natural resources saw strong growth and transportation grew low-single digit as aerospace saw some rate improvement. The UK retail business was up modestly year-over-year.", "This business continues to be in turn around mode, but has been steadily improving. So, to conclude our revenues, as you can see the majority of our business continue to grow well in the quarter, but our overall growth rate of 2.5% was to pull down by some specific issues in the Specialty division of Willis Re and in selective specialty businesses.", "With that, let me turn to expenses. I want to make a few brief observations about expenses. And then John will provide the appropriate level of details in his remarks. We told you last quarter, when we reported underlying expense grew of 6.1%, but we expected the rate of expense growth to decline at the second half of year. As the rate of increase in headcount slowed and our expense management initiatives to hold. In that context, our underlying expense growth in the current quarter was 4.1% an improvement relative to the first half of year.", "Two points of importance I would like to make about our expense growth rate. First, to-date, we have received very little different benefit in our expenses from our operational improvement program. Therefore, we achieved this expense growth moderation through our expense management initiatives that we briefly discussed last quarter. Second, as we are achieving this moderation expense growth, we continue to invest in talent in the value added areas and in our higher growth markets to drive future growth.", "So we are demonstrating progress in our expense growth rate, but to be clear, we obviously will not be pleased with any level of overall expense growth that exceeds our overall revenue growth. John will discuss the financial results of operations in greater detail. He will also provide an update on our operational improvement program, which is also a good start and we are pleased with the progress we are making. When he is finished I will come back to wrap up and discuss our inorganic growth before we turn to Q&A.", "With that, I\u2019ll hand it to John.", "John Greene", "Thank you, Dominic. I will be working up the third quarter\u2019s slide deck posted on our website, starting at Slide 3. This is a walkthrough showing the major earnings component in terms of both recorded and underlying EPS. From the third quarter 2013, third quarter 2014, from 3Q 2013 recorded on the left hand side. We adjust for $0.34 related to the debt extinguishment charge to give us an underlying 3Q 2013 EPS of $0.19.", "Moving across to slide, you can see increased commissions in fees for 3Q 2014 at $0.09 positive impact, an increased expenses at a $0.13 negative impact. The net of those items, a $0.04 reduction, represents the company\u2019s underlying business performance. Continuing across, you can see a net $0.01 negative impact from several items: higher quarter-over-quarter interest expense and a higher tax rate, partially offset by the results in our associate line and an increase from the non-controlling interest line.", "The net impact of these gets us to third quarter underlying EPS of $0.14 per share. Let me remind you that we define underlying as reported excluding non-operating items and the impacts of foreign exchange movements. So, to get from underlying EPS to reported we have $0.10 of adverse movement in foreign currency and $0.08 of cost from the operational improvement program.", "Drilling down into foreign exchange, we saw about $24 million of unfavorable movement. That breaks up as $3 million in commissions and fees and $7 million in operating expenses, which gives us a total of $10 million of foreign exchange translation impacts of $0.04 per share. Of that the most significant year-over-year currency movement for us was the relative strengthening of the pound against the dollar.", "We also had $14 million or $0.06 per share of unfavorable foreign currency impacts to our other income line, which is below operating income. This was primarily a change in foreign currency gains and losses on revaluation of the non-functional currency assets and liabilities. The operational improvement charge in the quarter amounted to $17 million. You can find a breakdown of the charge by segment and expense category in the press release. I would note that we\u2019ve achieved savings of about $2 million in the program in the third quarter, primarily from headcount reductions.", "Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4, on underlying EBITDA and net cash flow from operations. You recall that we view underlying EBITDA as decent proxy for cash flow. You can see from this slide that underlying EBITDA was $636 million, down about $10 million year-to-date, which is a reduction of less than 2%.", "Our net cash flows from operation over the first nine months of the year were down $85 million over the same period last year. The decrease was driven primarily by the non-recurrence of the close-out of derivative contracts in the third quarter last year, plus increased cash payment this year from our long-term incentive plans.", "Slide 5 shows our reported and organic commission and fee growth by segments. I would add three things to what Dominic said. First, there was no impact on our International results from the China revenue recognition issue from the fourth quarter of last year. Second, overall reported growth in our International segment was lower than organic growth due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movement. This was partially offset by acquired revenues, primarily Charles Monat. And third, North America\u2019s reported commission and fee growth was below organic growth because of the sale of some small slower growth businesses. We expect to close on the sale of a few more small offices in North America in the fourth quarter.", "Moving on to the total expense block on Slide 6. From the left, we adjusted prior year reported balance for $7 million of adverse foreign currency movements experienced in the current quarter, and $1 million of fees related to the debt extinguishment cost that we incurred within other operating expense during the third quarter last year. As a side note, we also paid $65 million tender premium related to the refi, but that flowed through interest expense on the net basis of last year\u2019s result.", "So that gets us to an underlying amount of $731 million of total expenses in last year\u2019s quarter. Moving across underlying expenses grew by $30 million or 4.1%. Salaries and benefits accounted for $22 million of the growth; other operating expense is $7, and the last million from depreciation and amortization. That gets you to $761 million of total underlying operating expenses in the current quarter. When you\u2019re adding the $17 million charge related to the operational improvement program, you get to the reported total expense of $778 million for 3Q 2014.", "Slide 7 provides more details on salaries and benefits. So the primary driver of salary and benefit expense grows over the past several quarters has been our investment in new talent. We told you last quarter that the growth in our salary and benefit line item would decline over the remainder of the year, as a result of the slow down in net headcount additions in 2014. In the second quarter of 2014, S&B increased 6.3% year-over-year. This quarter the rate of growth declined 4%. FTEs were up 2% since September 2013, so we increased headcount accounted for about half of the S&B growth. The remainder was largely due to salary increases, which were essentially in line with inflation.", "Headcount growth through the first nine month of 2014 was 1.7%, more than half of the growth is in our low cost operations in Mumbai. To be clear, the increase is not part of our operational improvement program, but rather part of them moved from low cost operations that we have been implementing before we announced the program. As we have said, the program in large part involves the significant acceleration of movements already well underway for many years, building on the skills and experience we have developed over those years.", "Turning to Slide 8, let me give you input on some of the non-operating items. Other income and expenses, which is below operating income includes the revaluation foreign currency loss. This is a $14 million year-over-year change, the primary currency drivers of this change were movements in the Venezuelan bolivar, the euro and the pound sterling against the U.S dollar.", "Taxes in the quarter were impacted by a $4 million adjustment reflecting an increased proportion of U.S earnings relative to the U.K, as you know the U.S corporate tax rate is almost double that of the UK. Our associate line showed improvement in the quarter driven by Gras Savoye.", "Let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet and uses of cash at slide 9. As you can see, we ended the third quarter with $656 million of cash, up over $30 million a year ago. The decreased cash balance relative to year-end was driven primarily by the share buyback program and increased cash dividend. This was partially offset by the non-reoccurrence of the third quarter 2013 tender premium paid on our debt refinancing.", "Regarding our uses of cash, I would highlight that we repurchased almost 2 million shares of stock for about $82 million during the quarter. Earlier this month, we completed our announced buyback program having repurchased little over 5 million shares in total at a cost of about $213 million. CapEx is up a little due to investments in systems and infrastructures, dividends are 9% higher and we have been more active in M&A, including the Charles Monat acquisition that closed in the second quarter.", "Let\u2019s turn to slide 10, to update on the operational improvement program we promised back in April. You\u2019ve read in our press release that we have updated our estimated savings based on the actions we are taking in 2014 or will take in 2015. We\u2019ve also provided saving of our projected spend.", "Starting with the updated saving, we are now estimating that we will achieve saving at least $8 million on actions we\u2019ve taken in 2014 that\u2019s $3 million ahead of our original estimate. The majority of the saving flowing for this year are from headcount reduction, primarily in our UK operation.", "For 2015, we are now estimating at least $60 million of in-year savings that\u2019s $50 million ahead of the original estimate. Our 2014 and 2015 actions will result in an estimated $120 million of annualized savings by the end of the program that is 40% of our $300 million estimated total annual saving. We still expect program cost savings of $135 million in 2016 and $235 million in 2017 as unchanged from our original estimates.", "Turning to the cost side, we expect to spend about $40 million in 2014 some of that of course the (inaudible) work and we expect to spend about a $130 million in 2015 that gives us about $170 million of the total $410 we anticipate on spending over the life of the program, the remaining $240 million will be spent in 2016 and 2017. Let me note that the spend (inaudible) as we\u2019ve defined the term here, this total operational improvement program related things for items it will flow directly through our income statements or through items that are capitalized and run through depreciation over the time, so it\u2019s a combination of expense and CapEx.", "We\u2019ve made a good start to the program, to help you track our progress, we\u2019ll provide you with three metrics indexed to margin this year, they are the ratio of FTEs in higher cost geographies to lower cost near-shore and off-shore centers which stood at ratio of 80% / 20%, plus the square footage of real estate per FTEs and desks per FTEs both indexed to 100, we believe these metrics will be helpful to you in measuring our progress on middle office and back office transitions and real estate efficient.", "With that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Dominic.", "Dominic Casserley", "Thank you, John. I\u2019d like to conclude with an update on our M&A activity. Last quarter we told you about the investment we\u2019ve made in our Human Capital and Benefits capabilities in the Nordics. Specifically, our acquisition of a controlling stake Max Matthiessen in Sweden, that transaction closed earlier this month and we\u2019re delighted to work in the Max Matthiessen team to our worldwide Human Capital and Benefits practice.", "Additionally, we\u2019re pleased to have announced the acquisition of SurePoint Reinsurance Advisors that will meaningfully expand our capabilities in the Accident & Health to insurance market in North America. And we also acquired a range of Irish Pension and Financial Advisory businesses from IFG which nicely compliment our global Human Capital and Benefits Practice. Finally we\u2019ve announced last week that Willis is an advanced exclusive talk with Miller Insurance Services LLP to take a majority interest in that leading independent specialist program, under the proposed transaction we would combine also businesses to trade under the Miller brand when we are able to we will update you on the progress of these discussions.", "Let me leave you with these thoughts about three plans of our strategies. First, I\u2019m convinced that our strategy to grow revenues organically through our global present by connecting Willis together to deliver better solution for our clients and through innovation. We\u2019ll continue to drive new business and increase our share of wallet from existing client despite some isolated negative items this quarter, we exhibited good organic growth in most of the business.", "Second, our measured acquisition strategy that is focused on high quality, specialized firms with leading market position, is proceeding well. We believe this strategy will further increase our growth rate and support our organic positioning.", "Third, you are starting to see the results of our disciplined approach to control expense growth and the early encouraging actions from our Operational Improvement Program. Together, these three items of organic growth focused, M&A and expense management give all us at Willis great confidents that we are heading in the right direction to achieve earnings growth, margin expansion and improved cash flow.", "With that operator may we please begin with the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes sir, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant of Nomura. Sir, your line is open.", "Cliff Gallant \u2013 Nomura Holdings Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you for your comments about the organic growth flowing in the quarter. And I wanted to just to clarify the \u2013 what is the outlook for Willis Insurance in the UK in the fourth quarter, should we continue to expect a little underperformance there offsetting the areas, is that right?", "Dominic Casserley", "Well let me handle it, I have obviously Steve Hearn who overseas with this Insurance UK, which part of global. Obviously with the plays as you know we don\u2019t provide quarter-to-quarter lendings revenue or cost specific guidance. But with that let me have Steve just give a sense of how we\u2019re doing?", "Steve Hearn", "Thanks Dominic. Thanks for the question. And I remind you of course, but our UK Insurance business is a sum of its parts. So we have some, as we pointed out in the script, some business that have performed well in Q3 and in fact performed well throughout the year for us. And some business that continue to drive significant growth for the organization, we have some challenges to it, UK retail has been a challenge for us for a period of time. Some years and not something that I\u2019ve been working on very hard over the quarter this year in terms of a turnaround program for our UK retails business.", "And let\u2019s say, we continue to drive strong growth in many parts of the organization. Within as well as our global specialty operations which continue to be market leading businesses and we\u2019re very proud of our position as market leader, with some strong margin contribution and profit from those in those businesses. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t get to the specifics as Dominic said of giving some guidance around what will happen in Q4.", "Cliff Gallant \u2013 Nomura Holdings Inc.", "Okay. As a follow-up on the U.S. construction, you discussed how the year-to-date number was up mid-single digit. And I just want to clarify that\u2019s what you see at the trend not the decline you saw in the third quarter.", "John Greene", "Well I\u2019m going to hand over to Todd to talk, Todd Jones to talk about U.S. construction, but clearly I think we try to indicate to you that we\u2019re obviously looking when we think about our revenues generically, looking at how they\u2019ve been performing during the course of the year as much as what happened in this particular quarter, but Todd why don\u2019t you talk about construction in the U.S?", "Todd Jones", "Yes I think, Dominic said it well, that if you look at how the businesses performed sort of quarter-over-quarter and then year-to-date, obviously our Q2 performance which was sort of mid-teens was a bit of an outlier in terms growth. And the expectation is the business continues to perform well, we continue to see a tremendous amount of activity on both the projects sates and the surety side and our expectations is, we\u2019re going to continue to perform in that states as we had year-to-date.", "Cliff Gallant \u2013 Nomura Holdings Inc.", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of (inaudible). Sir your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you. I realized the third quarter is seasonally a light quarter for revenue, but we\u2019re just trying to get a hand on when we might see some stabilization that just with pretax margin. I know third quarter may not be the best indicator of that, but as earnings estimate keep coming down, I think that will be a headwind on the start, so any insight you can help us with that will be helpful in this. Thanks?", "John Greene", "Well, again I can\u2019t give you, I\u2019m not going to give you specific guidance, but obviously the thing which you have to analyze is the sense of revenue momentum on ongoing basis versus where we see cost momentum. And I think you\u2019re trying to see the cost momentum, cost growth come down, so free the Operational Improvement Program, which hasn\u2019t really kicked in yet and we will see an acceleration of the of the impact of the Operational Improvement Program.", "So obviously our plan is to continue to have strong organic growth, to supplement that with M&A growth and to see the combination of normal expense management, which you started to see the impact of, combined with the Operational Improvement Program, to see the crossover into and the increase in margin expansion. And those were points I made at the end of my remarks. And we can see all the ingredients for that happen.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That\u2019s helpful. Do you think that crossover point, do you think that 2015 or 2016?", "John Greene", "Yes, okay. I hope it\u2019s as soon as we can possibly make it. The \u2013 you could after analyze what you\u2019d see the numbers going through, in terms of our revenue momentum and the deceleration of our organic expense growth. And how that\u2019s going to play out and John took you through for instance the trend lines in our salary and benefits over the last few quarters. And you can see that it\u2019s actually been flat, and the impact of the Operational Improvement Program.", "So we would obviously expect those trends continued that we will be able to see performance improving in good time.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then on a separate topic would be potential use of free cash for the Miller deal. What impact, if any, does that have on the potential acquisition of the remainder of Gras Savoye in 2015?", "John Greene", "Very good question. We remain very confident of our ability to fund both in Miller transaction and Gras Savoye through our normal cash flow on hand, and that capacity.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Sir your line is open.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Thank you. See the one slide on the OEP on the Operational Expense Program, you talked about savings been better than the April announcement or at least a trajectory of them. Is there any difference to the costs that you outlined or that you expected when you originally outlined the plan versus now? In other words, are you investing more now than you anticipated back in April? Thanks.", "John Greene", "We didn\u2019t give you the details back then, if you remember, how you expected to face our expense growth. I mean I think you can.", "", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Yes, I know.", "John Greene", "Expect, you can naturally expect that in our ability to accelerate saving. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to see some slight acceleration of expenses. Because that is too far water in the expenses, parallel running costs. Some redundancy costs in the specific system investments you might make to simplify a process. And obviously building out of capability to absorb more people in lower cost locations, you got to have somewhere for them to sit, for instance.", "So, obviously as we have accelerated our expectation of where our savings will come, we obviously would incur for obvious reasons, cost a bit earlier.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Got it, okay. And then I am just curious it\u2019s just going a little bit deeper operationally. What sort of actions are you taking to make sure that program doesn\u2019t negatively impact morale in the areas that you are looking to retain folks?", "John Greene", "Very good question and so all the leaders of this program, all the people are having involved in it are focussed on a number of metrics. Obviously, a critical issue about self-morale is actually how is this affecting client service? And so as we advance every single project we are also measuring client service metrics to make sure that, as we make changes, not only our clients but inform to understand what we are doing. But of course at the end of the day, we actually want client service metrics to go up. So we are first of all, very firmly focussing on client service as much as operational improvement as we or cost improvement as we do this.", "Secondly, should understand this s a program which is highly involving everybody, who is doing the change. These programs are not from some outside element doing the change, these are Willis driven programs, with people heavily involved in the operational improvements. As of that is the \u2013 the process we are going through.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it and then just on that \u2013 I mean, have you also incorporated into your sort of expectation, when you talk abut declining year-over-year increase and expenses, any potential for \u2013 higher retention costs or to the extent that becomes a tool that you utilize to manage retention or is that just not something do you anticipate of being an issue. Thanks?", "Dominic Casserley", "Well, we have two \u2013 obviously in the cost of the program include, first of all parallel running, right so, we have to run. Let\u2019s say we have a new process taking place in Mumbai, which was taking place in a city, in a developed market. We are going to run those two processes in parallel for a period of time to make sure that (inaudible) client services in place et cetera.", "And then, secondly, we obviously watch very carefully the \u2013 we are making sure that we can retain key people during that process. As you would expect we have normal approach to retention payments et cetera as necessary to make sure that key people while we\u2019re are making that transition are intended to stay.", "John Greene", "Dom, I think if I could add, in the (inaudible) there was a specific launch for retention works.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, the next question comes from the line Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is open.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning everyone. You know \u2013 first question is for John. Trying to understand slide three the EPS growth, when we are in the third quarter of 2015, going forward from this quarter into that earnings quarter. What is the underlying EPS number you start with? Is it $0.06, is it $0.14? I\u2019m trying to understand there\u2019s no foreign currency moving between 3Q, 2013 and 3Q, 2014. How does that comparable when 3Q, 2014 becomes history, what will the EPS number be recorded as, as it relate to 3Q, 2015 earnings?", "Dominic Casserley", "", "So the way we do this is we take the actual results in the prior year as effectively rebased for the currency that we\u2019re seeing. That\u2019s different between the current year and those offside their rebase, will be a FX adjustment reflected on the earnings block on Page 3.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "So, 2015 looking back on 3Q 2014, the EPS number will be $0.06 per share, the underlying EPS number will be $0.06 per share?", "Dominic Casserley", "", "No, no. It will depend on what actually happens to the rates in the period.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "The historical number, not the new number? There will be no currency rates at that point like at \u2013 currency, it was $0.06 per share and that will be the basis for which you measure performance in 3Q 2015?", "Dominic Casserley", "", "Yes. So what it\u2019ll do is that foreign currency movement effectively rebases to the prior year and then you\u2019re on a constant currency throughout the lock from one period to the next. If you like, we\u2019re happy to take this off-line and what you through the exact mechanics, but it\u2019s your standard constant currency analysis.", "", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. I guess I\u2019m just trying to rate my model with EPS over your quarters recorded for post air but the other question, last quarter question whether or not margins hit bottom and the answer was probably not with the end of 2014. We think your answer to Jay\u2019s question, I guess margins going bottom is doing as they can, but maybe you\u2019re taking a timeline away.", "Dominic Casserley", "", "No. I\u2019m never going to give a very, very specific timing on any particular quarter\u2019s revenue or cost performance in advance for the reason to be that we have time. I think you just have to look, as I said, in answer to the question earlier is that the trend line in our revenues in this year and what you see based upon our expense actions prior to the Operational Improvement Program, and we given you a lot of information on that in terms of how it\u2019s decelerating and what\u2019s happening to S&B cost quarter-to-quarter, and how that therefore is trending, and how we see the Operational Improvement Program flowing through.", "And we are very confident that we are doing all the right things to have those lines crossed and we\u2019ve been very kale, we will not be happy until we\u2019re regularly producing revenue growth which is more than cost growth. We think we are taking all the right actions to have that crossover happen as soon as possible.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "That makes perfect sense. Is the business is in good of a shape today as you thought it would be one year ago?", "Dominic Casserley", "No, I think in many ways it\u2019s in even better shape. Let me go through the elements of that. The fundamental drivers of organic growth of our strategy which is in the round connecting Willis together so that we can deliver around the world our specialty capabilities through our multiple channels to our clients. In a coordinated way it\u2019s well advanced. We\u2019ve made great strides in that, we are seeing good momentum in new business wins, pipelines are strong, we are very happy with the way that developing.", "Expense growth management, we deliberately made investments for that strategy I just described to you in the second half of 2013. We knew that was going to be pig in the python problem in terms of cost comparisons during 2014 and we said that you. We said that, we thought we were to expense growth declined during the quarter 2014 as we implemented expense management activity post that investment and you are seeing that take place and we are confident about that.", "We also, meanwhile, continue to be also investing the talent to drive that organic revenue growth, so we\u2019re confident about that. The operational improvement program which we only announced in April is ahead of where we thought it would be and is getting traction and we arc confident to deliver ahead of the schedule we laid out in April.", "And finally, we very, very explicitly laid out a M&A strategy focused on specialty situations which had strong franchises, high quality terms that we would not be going after just volume just bulking up, but instead we\u2019d be going after very specific transactions where we could engage in exclusive conversations to bring those very talented organization as part of the Willis family. We are very pleased on the progress we made on that and are highly excited about how it\u2019s going to play through in 2015. So actually, if you ask how do I feel about the health of Willis now compared to a year ago, I feel very good.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thank you for the answers and good luck in 2015.", "Dominic Casserley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith of Evercore. Your line is open.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Hi good morning. Part of the organic growth appears that a lot of the slowdown this quarter was sort of because of one time issues, because of the construction practice, is my understanding of that correct?", "Dominic Casserley", "Yes, well we\u2019ve highlighted that, if you look at the detail behind the headline of 2.5% organic growth. You can see that North America continued to grow little, the trend line has been on International growth again of over 6%; and so we had some very various specific issues, number of them coincidentally in construction. So, your interpretation is correct.", "", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "I\u2019m just looking over to the fourth quarter, do we have any sort of bad comps fourth quarter this year versus fourth quarter last year?", "Dominic Casserley", "Well as we said to you last year, we did have again a very strong construction quarter in the fourth quarter of 2013. So that will just be a tough com. But again, we remained optimistic about the trend line in the majority of our businesses.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Sure. And then upon the expense savings, I believe that it\u2019s about 8 million of expense savings on the operational driven program, has that already flowed through earnings this year or do you expect that in the fourth quarter?", "Dominic Casserley", "No, I think we made out that we had a very-very small number in the third quarter. So, the majority of that number will obviously flow into the fourth quarter.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay, and the $60 million for next year, how much do you expect to flow down to the bottom-line and how much do you expect to reinvest in the business?", "Dominic Casserley", "Well, we said overall, but I think the majority of the savings we have will flow to the bottom-line. I think the way to think about this is the different component parts that drive our expenses. And let me hand over to John, to help you think about that.", "John Greene", "Thank you, Dominic. So if you think about our cost base, it\u2019s a subject to inflation, somewhere between 2% to 3% based on the geographic mix. So that naturally wants to increase the expense base. We have the operational improvement program, the savings that we\u2019re talking about here, coming through as an offset to some of that inflation. And then there will be select investments that continue to be able to drive positive operating margin growth and we\u2019re going to do that, but we\u2019re going to do that but we\u2019re going to be very specific in making sure that we get definitive paybacks on that, so you can do the math based on what I just described there.", "So really good progress in the operational improvement program, inflation 2% to 3% is what we\u2019re seeing based on the geographic mix, and selective investments we said that the majority of the operational improvement program would saw through.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Sure. And one last question and I apologize for the many questions, but on the other expense line I believe you said $14 million of that was for the foreign exchange, but the reported number was $9 million. What\u2019s the difference between the two?", "John Greene", "So the $14 million is revaluation FX and there was a translation FX of about $10 million, so there is a difference between the two. The revaluation FX basically takes a look at non-monitory aspects and liabilities and it takes the year-over-year change in the FX rate doesn\u2019t reval and that creates a P&L debit or credit charge or income. So this quarter what we saw when we compared to third quarter 2013, we saw weakening of the Europe, Venezuela, and Boulevard and the pound sterling versus third quarter 2013 where we saw strengthening in the Euro and the pound as you will recall. So that difference created a year-over-year P&L charge of $14 million that we talked about in my script.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Thank you.", "John Greene", "Is it helpful?", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Yes, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you and good morning. First a quick question on the restructuring cost and thank you for the breakdown, but you mentioned already about the total costs 70% probably attributable to people and 30% to system. Is that same proportional throughout the years for your restructuring cost?", "Dominic Casserley", "Broadly, yes.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then secondly on the margin question, if you were thinking about because of economic slowing down whatever marketable issues that your organic growth staying at like, let\u2019s say 2% to 3%-ish range. Well, the cost \u2013 the operational improvement program enough for the savings to drive some margin expansion there or it\u2019s difficult even with the ongoing improvements in operations?", "Dominic Casserley", "So I think we tried to be very clear and clarify this issue of what the impact of the operational improvement program as it plays through. If we were to see organic growth rates, normal organic growth rates of the business \u2013 the numbers you see, so that the equivalent of over 4% we see in year-to-date. If we were to see that number at the lower end of our single-digit range sort of much lower than that 4% number, the operational improvement program, we believe, underpinned our ability to achieve our margin expansion number. If we see more robust growth at the middle or higher end of our mid single-digit, obviously the operational improvement program enables us to expand margin over time more than that 70 basis points. That\u2019s the explanation we\u2019ve given and that\u2019s how we see it.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, that\u2019s great. Then lastly, I\u2019m just curious about your thought about capital management priorities. So especially between \u2013 now you\u2019ve been very focused on some of the focused acquisition just versus like share buybacks. I just wonder what you saw behind, doing acquisitions or return to shareholders?", "Dominic Casserley", "No, I think our position remains where it has been. We continue to focus on our capital management as followed. Obviously, we have to fund CapEx et cetera as we drive the business. Next, we want to be able to grow our dividend as our earnings grow. Third, we want to immunize the balance sheet on the number of share count for our option exercises \u2013 employee option exercises. We did that in 2014 with the program we announced. And then, we had M&A. And that\u2019s how we are thinking about our program and obviously managing accordingly.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So, actually the buybacks are just to neutralize the share creation actually ahead of acquisition. So it seems you\u2019ll finish your program $200 million, so is there going to be another one just outside ongoing the issuance?", "Dominic Casserley", "We will examine what\u2019s happening to the option exercises this year and look what\u2019s happening in the outlook and make an announcement accordingly.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you so much for the answers.", "Dominic Casserley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital. Sir, your line is open.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital", "Good afternoon. Well, I got some numbers question, I apologize. But Dominic, if you go back to your sort of original plan \u2013 five-year plan to grow revenues 70 bps faster than the expenses, the math works out to about 250 basis point margin improvement from a 21.6 base of 2012. You lost the 160 bps of ground last year and you\u2019re 100 bps behind for this year, so that puts you 260 bps behind which gives you 500 bps to get in the next three plus years. The optimist in me says that, well they have been updated that plan Dominic must still have confidence that it\u2019s achievable.", "The realist in me says that with the economic impairment, little less good than we thought it might be a couple of years ago and currency, a little bit in your phase and rates slowing, to try to get 500 bps of margin improvement in three plus years seems like it\u2019s is a formidable task. Who is right the optimist or the realist?", "John Greene", "We\u2019ll see, it\u2019s overwhelming, won\u2019t we?", "Dominic Casserley", "I\u2019m obviously not going to answer that question, I kind of going go back to what I said earlier right. Which is that we have a very strong Operational Improvement Program we put place, which can deliver very significant cost benefits. You\u2019re right to say, that our befits to drive our margin expansion and most important you\u2019ve all the number as you know. You and I talked about a number of times that I\u2019m really focused on, which is cash flow generation, right. That\u2019s the real number, which we will be focused on. Our ability to that is obviously dependent, as well on well revenues grow, which to some degree is impacted by the economic outcome.", "I would, reiterate what I said earlier today, which is, I\u2019m pleased do not drive a direct correlation between economic performance on global economy and our ability to grow organic revenues. There is some correlation, of course. Of course there is.", "But we have shown, I think, quite successfully over for long period of time. That in a number our markets, we are able to outgrowth nominal GDP, because either we\u2019re taking shift or because actually the underlying growth of brokerage of property and casualty insurance or healthcare in commercial state is growing much faster than the underlying economy. So yes of course were affected by economic outlook, but it\u2019s not a one-to-one type ratio.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital", "Well did you take service that you haven\u2019t adjusted your 2013 plan. So to me that those can be a confidence that you think you\u2019re on track. So just another question and, how does your incentive comp plan tied to your results, your cash payments were higher this year than before because of I assume history not anything related to this year, next year results. But if margins aren\u2019t expanding, is there a question and maybe that number sort of declining perspectively?", "Dominic Casserley", "Yes, you\u2019re right, perfectly you\u2019re right that \u2013 to what we referred to this year, we referred to an old plan. I mean you should be very confident and it\u2019s all available with that. The two key drivers of incentive compensation which is our annual bonus plan and our long-term incentive plan are directly tied to the performance of revenue growth and EBITDA growth in the annual plan, and on the long-term plan, multi-year revenue growth and EBIT growth overtime. And so, yes, you are right. Our incentive programs are absolutely aligned with the things that drive cash flow generation.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital", "Is there a potential positive in Q4 as you true-up or do you, has that been trued up to the year when you\u2019re accounting?", "Dominic Casserley", "We true up as best we can as we go, okay.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital", "So don\u2019t look for that as a potential headwind and tailwind in the fourth quarter is your answer?", "Dominic Casserley", "No, I wouldn\u2019t do that. We try and to our best to true up as we go.", "Robert Glasspiegel \u2013 Janney Capital", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Thomas Mitchell of Miller Tabak. Sir, your line is open.", "Thomas Mitchell \u2013 Miller Tabak", "", "I\u2019m a little bit curious. I understand that the Venezuelan Bolivar may not be very hedgeable but it would seem that your other currency exposures are hedgeable, is it just terribly expensive to go into the market and hedge for currencies or have you just generally decided to live with the ups and downs?", "Steve Hearn", "Yes, so a good question. So we\u2019ve actually spent some time looking at it, so there is the translation that which is running through the P&L so revenue and expense, not the other income or expense line. That piece has to do with the structural mismatch in the U.K. in terms of 60% of the revenue comes-in in dollars, the cost base is sterling. So we\u2019ve looked at that and it\u2019s impossible to get a cost effective hedge that would also hedge the movements in the currencies. It is just really, really hard thing to do. We\u2019ve talked to a number of bankers who had some ideas about it, but nothing that we viewed is something that we could implement.", "In terms of the revaluation FX, our program there is basically \u2013 what we try to do is ensure that functional currency cost and functional currency revenue are matched and thereby having a natural, natural hedge. And if there is a change in the underlying FX rate period-over-period, we gain that largely the non-cash so we haven\u2019t gone through to try to hedge that. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we broken out the underlying way we\u2019ve done that.", "Thomas Mitchell \u2013 Miller Tabak", "Right, and okay that helps very much. Thank you. The other question I have is a little bit more conceptual. I mean it\u2019s about something that we all sort of think we understand, but the construction business has stops and starts sensitive to different things. It\u2019s probably different in the UK than it is in the U.S. but in general, there must be some sort of leading indicators that you have to give you an idea of whether projects are going to be started or they\u2019re going to be delayed and how big they are and how much coverage they need to win? What is sort of the timing of this sort of thing? You have to wait until somebody breaks ground to assume that you now have a coverage initiated?", "Timothy D. Wright", "", "So, I\u2019m going to ask Steve talk about that. I think it is worth of course remembering that within construction, there are sort of lower ticket items going through on an ongoing basis and of course then these big projects right which can affect the quarter-to-quarter numbers. Do you want to talk more about the latter, Steve?", "Steve Hearn", "Yes, I mean you are absolutely right Tom. It is very much close and to your question or in your question which is, there are difference between UK and North America impact, the coverage is different and in fact the market is to provide the capacity are often different as well.", "I should say as well construction for us is strength, it\u2019s been an issue for us as we called in terms of some specifics around Q3 but we are a significant leader both in the UK and in North America in terms of construction business and for both of those activities in fact around the world from our UK business. Obviously, it\u2019s the large and profitable activity for us.", "But as Dominic described, it\u2019s made up of lots of different things that the continual pipeline of smaller projects which we have significant shareholder and continue to come through very effectively for us. It is typically the larger projects that drive the lumpiness that you see in our performance both positively and negatively. The lead time can be significant on, I mentioned in some cases, fast projects on billions of dollars of deal every initial asset value in some cases and those are very complex in terms the way they finance, very complex in terms of the way they tended often multiple suppliers involved and often multiple brokers engaged in terms of providing the coverage and the voice around us.", "And again, buried in your question, if you\u2019ll excuse the pump, it is literally when the shovel spade goes into the ground that we know we have contract in place that show a risk on many of these projects. You\u2019re right.", "Thomas Mitchell \u2013 Miller Tabak", "", "Well, thank you very much. It\u2019s very clear.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Sir, your is open.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Great. Thank you, good morning. If I can keep beating on the construction issue, are there seasonal quarters where construction is a bigger or smaller portion of your project?", "Dominic Casserley", "", "I believe also that is no. Again, as I said, because these are very significant contracts and we are particularly strong in that area, it really is about when a contract is awarded and construction begins and that dealt and tie around unlike other parts of the insurance where they\u2019ll tie around sort of traditional renewal date, sort of seasonal renewal dates. When you see other parts of our business, it\u2019s when the contract is awarded. The more run at the middle business maybe you\u2019d see most funded business as usually if you like. You maybe see an element of that, but no, it\u2019s not skewed certainly in the UK and international world and I believe that\u2019s the case in North America as well.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I think I have a question for Dominic, I\u2019m not sure. You had an impressive slowdown inorganic expense growth from 1.4 to 1.0. When we consider the variable expenses associated with some of the business though if organic revenue growth would have been a 4.5% range. Could you give us a sense of what organic expense growth would have been?", "Dominic Casserley", "I\u2019ll first cut it there. That is not the driver here. We might have had slightly more incentive compensation, so profits would have been better. But it\u2019s not \u2013 I think the thing that\u2019s very important, we do not believe that the slow down in our revenue growth is because we\u2019ve been slowing expense growth, right. We highlighted we use specific teams that got on specific businesses, and meanwhile International has been growing over 6%, North America is growing over 3% et cetera. We might have \u2013 as I said had some got a better performance. To the earlier question we had about accruing bonuses we might had slightly higher bonus accrual, John do you want to add?", "John Greene", "Yes, the only thing I would add is when we look at the second quarter, the year-over-year quarter-over-quarter headcount change was about a increase of 4% in the second quarter 2014 versus second quarter 2013.", "So that we put on some inflation on there and it\u2019s \u2013 it gets you up to that 6 plus percent number we talked about. In the September results, what we\u2019re seeing is that headcount increase versus September last year of only 2%, so that really explains the delta in the cost.", "Dominic Casserley", "", "Yes, yes.", "", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. So the increase and I appreciate what you were saying about the incentive compensation, I was just asking more about sort of fundamental producer compensation that wouldn\u2019t have been (inaudible) different.", "Dominic Casserley", "Same, same.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "", "Okay.", "", "Dominic Casserley", "No. And in fact the North American producer compensation because we had, we\u2019ve got actually good quarter in North America running above the normal levels.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Sir, your line is open.", "", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Yes, thanks. Just a couple of quick question, first, I was wondering if you could drill down a little bit more in free cash flow. I was wondering, if you could talk about what was the actual dollar figure of the non-recurring and derivative to close out last year versus this year. So, if we can just get a better kind of run rate of what free cash flow kind of looks like right now? Or is it the right thing what I can think about? And is there anything else going on there? And then lastly, pension any updated thoughts on what pension contributions look like next year?", "Dominic Casserley", "Okay. Yes, I\u2019ll be happy to take that. So, there were three hedging activities that ended out coming through and creating a year-over-year difference. So, there was a treasury lock last year 2013 that through about $20 million ended at P&L. There was an interest rate swap in 2013 that was about $15 million dollars of cash. And then, in the current year, related to the Max Matthiessen acquisition, there was another swap that ended up creating about a $15 million delta negative to cash.", "So, you sum those up and you got about $50 million quarter-over-quarter issue. We also had in the quarter some working capital changes. It seems a significant portion of that, the working capital fees had to do with the reclassification of some businesses to assets held for sale which is other assets, which the amortization \u2013 the goodwill and intangibles where long-term assets will move up to short-term.", "So that creates a working capital, that could increase the drives of cash flow number at least in terms of what you are looking at. It\u2019s really not a cash item, matter of fact the exit of the business will create some positive cash flow for the fourth quarter.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Pension.", "Dominic Casserley", "Pension. Yes, so thank you, Dominic. In terms of pension year-to-date we are under prior year. So, we\u2019ve contributed about $25 million this year and versus $48 million in the third quarter last year. What we expect for the year is year-over-year pension contributions will probably be down about $20 million.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Year-over-year, okay. And any thoughts on 2015 at this point.", "Dominic Casserley", "No. Not at that this point.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And then, just one last one here, I\u2019m just curious, I know you can\u2019t give any details with respect to Millers as far as the financial implications and stuff like that. But what about your strategic rationale behind the trend action, I wanted to give a little bit, why?", "Dominic Casserley", "Now, I\u2019m going to turn to Steve, because obviously the facts particularly our London business is our position in our market.", "Steve Hearn", "", "Sure. I am going to keep it straight not to get into any detail in terms of different action itself. It\u2019s a difficult question to answer without doing that. Millers I think people would recognize and be preeminent independent wholesaler in the London market, a Company that\u2019s operating for over a 100 years under the Miller brand with a very slow wholesale content and as we declared on the amounts that we have an exclusive conversation around this acquisition with also some businesses that we move into Willis, and that the treaty reinsurance business by its own.", "We have strong credential in wholesale business Willis and overall history in wholesale. In fact if you track back only a couple of decades ago, Willis was fundamentally a wholesale group of itself until that time when it\u2019s set up its retail capability international and in North America. Until this day, we have significant wholesale capability within our existing London operations.", "We felt strategically that it might sense particularly given the connecting Willis strategy, it\u2019s deepening our connections across the organization around the world. we recognized the different around wholesale and this provides the fantastic vehicles, if I would conclude this, it will allow us to operate in fact in those markets. a connected Willis organization times the strength of our specialty businesses and the London market wholesale operations.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. No question at this time. (Operator Instructions)", "Peter Poillon", "", "All right. Given that there are no more questions on the line, we just close that you have, because it would be on time. I\u2019ll just put some few closing remarks. First of all, let me reiterate, there have currently been several unusual events this quarter and of course, it\u2019s that side, it is the compass reinsurance market for example, for over a decade.", "We feel we are making progress in our efforts on expense management at this quarter\u2019s outcome insurance growth illustrates we\u2019re really encouraged by the results we\u2019re seeing in the operational improvement program and what we can see that will achieve in 2015.", "So we have a long way to go on this, but so far so good, and we won\u2019t be distracted from our goals that we\u2019ve laid out. looking further out, of course, economic growth in many major markets as everyone comments that people evolved from this quarter remains uneven. So we of course, are really cautious, but our revenue performance year-to-date underscores the value of related business model and the power of our portfolio and our components in the future.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll review our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. Reported revenues for the quarter were $878 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year first quarter reported revenues and up 7% on an organic basis. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 7%. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. Our EBITDA for the quarter was $171 million or 19.5% of revenues. The prior first quarter EBITDA was $146 million or 18.0% of revenues. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.16 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.32.", "We are very pleased with the overall results this quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, despite continued global economic uncertainty, all regions reported constant currency revenue growth. The Benefits and Exchange Solutions segments delivered strong results. Bulk lump sum, health care consulting and pension administration drove revenue growth in the Benefits segment. A strong off-cycle enrollment period for OneExchange and increased client work in Health and Welfare Administration drove revenue growth in the Exchange Solutions segment.", "Now let's look at the performance of each of our segments. As a reminder, the results for the Benefits and Exchange Solutions segment have been updated to reflect the expansion of the Exchange segment. Please refer to our 8 K-letter SEC filing on September 16, 2014, for a quarterly view of the impacted results.", "On an organic basis, Benefits revenues increased 7%, Risk and Financial services increased 1%, Talent and Rewards was flat and Exchange Solutions increased 37%. For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $466 million. Retirement revenues increased by 6% on a constant currency basis, primarily as a result of bulk lump sum work. Health and Group Benefits revenues grew 7% on a constant currency basis due to new client and project work. Technology and Administration Solutions revenues increased by 20% on a constant currency basis due to bulk lump sum projects and new client work. We anticipate that the Benefits segment will show solid growth for the full year with a strong first half of the fiscal year and lower growth in the second half of the fiscal year, as bulk lump sum project activities slows.", "Now let me turn to Risk and Financial services. For the quarter, the Risk and Financial Services segment had revenues of $148 million as compared to $142 million for the first quarter of fiscal '14. Revenues were up 1% on a constant-currency basis, driven by an increase in Risk Consulting and Software revenue. Risk Consulting and Software revenue increased 5% on a constant currency basis. The growth was led by EMEA due to an increase in utilization as a result of the restructuring, better project management and continued market stabilization. Software revenues continue to be strong. The sales pipeline looks solid in the Americas, and Asia Pacific continues to be more cyclical due to the reliance on project work in that region.", "Investment had a 4% constant currency revenue decline as compared to an 11% growth in the first quarter of fiscal '14. Project work in Canada was softer than anticipated. We also saw some softness in the pipeline in EMEA, which we believe to be a timing issue. We continue to feel confident in the investment business. The Risk Consulting and Software business continues to perform as expected and overall conditions seem to have solidified as compared to a year ago. Investments should continue to provide solid long-term growth.", "Now let's move on to Talent and Rewards. For the quarter, the Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $153 million with revenues flat on a constant currency basis. Data, Surveys and Technology revenues decreased by 4% on a constant currency basis as expected. There were 2 drivers: strong comparables and the planned timing of survey delivery between the first and second quarters.", "Last fiscal year, constant currency revenue growth was 17%. Surveys were delivered in the first quarter last year as composed to the second quarter this fiscal year. Rewards Talent and Communication revenues decreased by 1% on a constant currency basis. The EMEA region posted 2% growth, but this was offset primarily by OneExchange-related projects, where the revenues are deferred until the annual benefit enrollment is completed and policies are effective. Executive compensation revenues were up 10% on a constant currency basis, with all regions posting growth. The Americas region continues to see project work driven by M&A and IPOs. EMEA's growth also continues to be driven by M&A activity and new industry wins due to specific marketing initiatives. We are generally seeing some positive momentum in all lines of business in this segment.", "Lastly, I'd like to move to the Exchange Solutions segment. For the quarter, the Exchange Solutions segment had revenues of $86 million, an increase of 41% on a constant currency basis. Our Retiree and Access exchange revenues increased 49%. Health and Welfare Administration grew 16%. Active Exchanges grew $3.8 million.", "We enrolled approximately 40,000 new OneExchange Retiree members and approximately 14,500 OneExchange Active employees in the first quarter of this fiscal year, or what are generally referred to as off-cycle enrollments. We're now underway with our annual enrollment process and are pleased with the progress to date. Annual enrollments are effective as of January 1.", "We're also very pleased to report that Towers Watson's OneExchange was selected to be the retiree medical exchange provider for the Ohio Public Employee Retirement System, OPERS, Medicare Connector, effective January 2016. We're very excited by this announcement and look forward to the opportunity to serve the OPERS retirees.", "As we move into the 2015 enrollment period, we've assessed the results of our OneExchange Active 2014 savings and the inflation rates for 2015. Employers are saving approximately $1,400 per active employee with $500 passing through to the employee. Original assumptions assumed a savings of approximately $900 per active employee.", "Due to the plans and programs built into OneExchange, such as intensive chronic disease management, we've seen best practices bend the cost curve. OneExchange employers are projected to experience a 1.8% increase of total spending on health care in 2015 as compared to 2014. Total spend includes funding for coverage from employers as well as employee contributions and out-of-pocket costs.", "For comparison, midsize to large employers not using a private exchange expect a 4% increase in 2015 health care costs for active employees after some planned design changes. If no plan changes are made, employers project a 5.2% growth rate. Our growth rate of only 1.8% is very close to the latest CPI, and it's an important metric in order to help our clients avoid the excise tax on high-value plans, known as the Cadillac Tax, which goes into effect in 2018. We're very proud of these results as they're a testament to our associate\u2019s deep expertise in health care, strong relationships with the carriers and most of all, the client focus.", "As discussed on previous earnings calls, the Health and Welfare Administration group won a number of new client projects during FY '14. Most of the revenue associated with these projects is deferred until the system implementations are complete and the systems go live. Due to the great work of our Health and Welfare team, a couple of implementations were completed ahead of schedule this quarter, thus allowing us to recognize revenues sooner than originally estimated.", "We continue to be in the markets selling OneExchange Retiree and Active clients for fiscal '15 and all OneExchange Solutions for FY '16. The Health and Welfare Administration business has a strong pipeline, and we feel positive about all the business -- all the lines of business in this segment.", "On a personal note, I just wanted to give my thanks to Bryce Williams, the CEO and Co-Founder of Extend Health, and wish him all the best in his newest business challenge. In his 2.5 years with Towers Watson, Bryce helped establish OneExchange Retiree and Access. We've built a strong brand with a reputation for excellence in the overall exchange market. We fully expect that our momentum will carry on and our leadership position will get only stronger.", "So we had a first -- great first quarter, and I'd like to thank all of our employees for their dedication to the market and our clients. By always keeping our clients' needs first and focusing on their success, we've built a strong brand and have been honored with client relationships that span decades and build a framework for long-term sustainable and profitable growth.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger F. Millay", "Great. Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone. I'd also like to add my thanks and congratulations to our associates for delivering strong quarterly results.", "Now let's turn to the financial overview. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition accounting costs. For the quarter, the Benefits segment had a 33% NOI margin, up from 30% in last year's quarter, as bulk lump sum projects drove margin growth for both the retirement and the Technology and Administration lines of business.", "Risk and Financial services had a 24% NOI margin, an increase from 16% last year. At this time last year, the restructuring of the Risk Consulting and Software line of business was just getting underway. This is now the third consecutive quarter where margins have exceeded prior year comparisons and have stabilized to historical levels.", "Talent and Rewards had a 24% NOI margin as compared to a 29% margin in last year's first quarter. As John mentioned earlier, the change in timing of our compensation survey delivery impacted the first quarter revenues. This impact fell to margin. We also observed restructuring costs in the first quarter.", "Exchange Solutions had a 16% NOI margin. The OneExchange Retiree margin increased year-over-year due to growth leverage, process improvements and engaging more full-time call center associates as off-cycle enrollments have become more common. Full-time associates are about 3x as effective as seasonal workers. The overall Exchange Solutions margin also reflected the absorption of continuing investments. As a reminder, Liazon wasn't acquired until November of 2013.", "Our strong growth in the Health and Welfare Administration business also pressured margin. While the team completed 2 implementation projects earlier than anticipated, and we were able to recognize revenues sooner than expected, as a result of additional new client wins, there are other ongoing implementation projects which will be completed later this fiscal year. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter was $82 million, adjusted net income was $93 million.", "The tax rate for continuing operations for the quarter was 35% as compared to our guided rate of 33% to 34%. The quarterly tax rate was impacted by a onetime discrete item, but we continue to maintain our full year tax rate expectations. As a reminder, the tax rate in the first quarter of last year was 15% as a result of onetime favorable tax settlements.", "Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. At September 30, we had $517 million in cash and $127 million of short-term investments available for our use. Approximately 95% of the available cash and short-term investments are outside the U.S.", "For the first quarter of fiscal '15, our free cash outflow was $221 million as compared to an outflow of $178 million for the first quarter of fiscal '14. As a reminder, the first quarter of the fiscal year is seasonally a heavy period of cash use for the company due to the payment of discretionary bonuses.", "Several factors impacted our first quarter free cash flow: a onetime tax payment related to the sale of the brokerage business, timing of the E&O insurance payment and strong collections in fiscal year '14. These items were partially offset by lower discretionary compensation and benefit -- pension benefits. Free cash flow generally improves through each consecutive quarter during the fiscal year. We continue to anticipate free cash flow to be in the neighborhood of net income.", "We had $135 million of borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter as a result of the bonus payments. While we don't have a public debt offering, we target investment grade status on a rating agency basis. This translates into a target range of 2x to 3x debt to EBITDAR, when including retirement and leasing obligations. We are currently at the lower end of that range. We weigh the balance sheet flexibility and cash returns to shareholders on a quarterly basis. Based on our most recent review last quarter, we once again enhanced the return of cash to shareholders for fiscal '15 and the board approved a $300 million share repurchase authority. This authority replaces our previous share repurchase authorities. During this quarter, we repurchased approximately 350,000 shares for about $37 million. The board also approved a 7% dividend increase.", "Let me turn now to the fiscal year '15 guidance. Overall, we continue to expect revenues to be around $3.6 billion. Given the strong first quarter results, we've enhanced our view of adjusted EPS and EBITDA margins. We're now expecting our fiscal '15 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in -- within the range of $5.85 to $5.97. We expect our EBITDA margin for the year to be around 20%. We continue expect the fiscal '15 income tax rate to be in the range of 33% to 34%. This estimated range doesn't include the impact of potential tax examinations or other items that could settle in this fiscal year.", "For the fiscal year, our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of USD 1.62 to the British pound and an average exchange rate of USD 1.28 to the euro. In our previous fiscal year '15 guidance, we used an estimate of $1.30 to the euro. The estimate for the British pound remains unchanged.", "We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be between 70 million and 70.5 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share will continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share. Given the strong first quarter results and the demand we're seeing for bulk lump sum projects in the second quarter of the fiscal year, we've increased our expectation for constant currency revenue growth to the mid-single digits for the Benefits segment. The NOI margin for Benefits is expected to be in the low-30% range.", "Next, in the Risk and Financial Services segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth in the low single digits. The risk consulting and software market continues to stabilize. However, given the current economic conditions in EMEA, where both the RCS and the investment business are heavily weighted, we're maintaining our fiscal year '15 guidance. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low to mid-20% range.", "In the Talent and Rewards segment, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth to be flat to low single-digit growth. Market conditions have not changed significantly. There are geographies where we've seen some stabilization, but not enough to move our overall view. We expect the NOI margin to be in the low-20% range.", "Finally, in the Exchange Solutions segment, we continue to expect revenue growth in the high-20% range. We continue to feel positive about the overall fiscal year '15 OneExchange enrollments. We expect the NOI margin to be in the high-teens range. As a reminder, Exchange Solutions profitability is seasonally low in the first half of the fiscal year. The profitability of the first quarter is not indicative of a change in trend.", "I'd like to conclude by reiterating how pleased I am with the quarterly results. I'm also impressed with the agility of our associates that keep abreast of market trends and the speed at which we can adapt to these trends to develop solutions that help in our clients' success.", "Now I'll turn it back to John.", "John J. Haley", "Okay. Thanks very much, Roger, and now we'll open it for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Andre Benjamin.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First question was on the Benefits segment. You said a lot of growth was driven by lump sum payment work which you expect to be strong in the first half of the year and then decelerate in the second half. I was just wondering, is there any way that you can maybe put a little context around your view of how much of client base in general still has potential to do some work here either today or at some point in the future?", "John J. Haley", "I guess -- so we can look at trying to give some additional color around that, Andre. I would say though that bulk lump sums are something that there's only been modest inroads into that business. So there's enormous potential, I think, left to do that. But why don't we go back and see if we can give you some more color -- go back and see what we can provide you with.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then in light of the midterm elections last night, not necessarily looking for personal views on the outcome. But I just wondering if there any notable trends or commentaries from your clients that you heard in the lead up to the election that may indicate, if any of them were thinking about changing their business activity either in the near or medium term if the Senate, indeed, swung to GOP control like it did last night?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. I don't think -- we haven't heard anything like that, that would affect our business one way or the other. I mean, the only thing that really comes up at all is speculation about whether there would be changes made to the Cadillac Tax, if the Republicans were in control. And I think anything around that is really just speculation, I think at this moment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. First of all, just 2 Exchange questions, please. You had some pretty significant Q-on-Q growth in Exchange Solutions revenue. Was that mainly the off-cycle enrollments you talked about? Or was there anything else driving that revenue, obviously, excluding Benefit outsourcing? And then second, Mercer had a great enrollment here in the fall, I think, roughly 800,000 lives. I know maybe that number is not directly comparable to the number you reported, maybe you could talk to that also. But with that sort of 800,000, I think what they would say eligible employees that they reported this year. Does that sort of change your view on next year? And what do you think you need to do in the fall of '15 to be competitive with what Mercer just reported.", "John J. Haley", "Yes. Okay. Thanks very much, Paul. So I think on the first question, that really was the off-cycle enrollments that drove that. On the second question, I would say that -- just to think about this, if there's a case, let's say, we have a client that maybe has 10,000 employees and we sign them up for the exchanges, what we'll do is we'll look and say, okay, out of those 10,000 employees, what do we think is the likely number that will enroll with us. And so, if we say we think we're going to get 7,000 out of the 10,000, and people might, for various reasons, might not sign up, they might be on a spouse's plan or there's a myriad of other reasons. So if we might say that 7,000 out of the 10,000 we think are the likely ones who will sign up first, then we'll report 7,000 there. I think the numbers you're referring to they came about because instead of taking the 10,000 employees, you multiply that by 2.2 to get all possible covered employees or covered individuals including dependents or something like that and report a number of 22,000. So you're right, they're not apples to apples there. We think that giving you the number that we're getting the revenue based on is more meaningful for assessing how we're doing. But I mean, I leave it up to each company to figure out what the most useful reporting is. But I think to the larger case, I think we've said all along that we thought this would be a market that, the health care exchanges, where there would be a few large competitors that would pretty much dominate the market. We talked in May in terms of maybe 3 or 4 competitors. We always thought that we would be one of them and that Aon would be one of them and there would be at least one, probably, from Amerigroup, and Mercer looks to be doing well and could be one of them. But I don't think that changes our view overall. We are looking to get somewhere in the 25% to 30% of the market. And we still think we'll continue to do that. Interestingly enough, we do see Aon a lot in competitive situations and relatively, rarely run into Mercer.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Does their success in this enrollment period change your view on the adoption rate? Or does that give -- make you more positive on adoption next year?", "John J. Haley", "I don't think it really changes things one way or the other. I mean, I think we still look at the market the same way that it's a very big market. It's got lots of opportunities. There's probably going to be a few winners and we're just focused on being one of them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "One of the things that I'm looking for, and I think a lot of investors are looking for, are the potential for a really big marquee client on the Active side that puts full-time employees on there. Can you talk about, are there in the pipeline deals are a piece, that are out there that would constitute something like that, like an IBM -- that it's just really a matter of kind of timing? Or how do you see the potential for something like that to show up?", "John J. Haley", "Shlomo, I don't -- we're talking to clients that -- potential clients that run the gamut. But there are certainly a number that I would consider marquee names there. But the fact that we're talking to them how close they are to adoption, whether they are once that might sign up for 1/1/2016, I mean, I think the only thing I could say is it wouldn't surprise me if they did, but it wouldn't necessarily surprise me if they waited another year too. So I don't really know what to say about really big marquee clients like that.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "But they are in the discussion levels with you guys in there or...", "John J. Haley", "Yes. I mean, people are intrigued and interested by this concept. I think we've gotten a lot of traction talking to folks also about the 1.8% medical cost inflation rate that we had. I think that's something that people are very interested in, in how we were able to achieve that.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then for the last, probably bunch of quarters, we kept hearing about European weakness. And while you touched on it a little bit, you really -- like in your press release, you really didn't talk about that at all. Are you seeing stabilization or you're just seeing outperformance? Or can you -- from execution, could you just give us some color over there.", "John J. Haley", "Yes. I mean, I think -- and this is one where you almost have to go through this by the line of business. When I was mentioning the Risk and Financial services, I was talking about the improvement in RCS and the market stabilizing for RCS in Europe. And that's one of the things where we've seen a lot of improvement there. Now we had the tough comparables I talked about and those we're -- that was related to Europe mostly and the investment side of things. But still, that -- the investment continues to chug along and perform well, we think, in the longer term there. Talent and Rewards, when you look at it, we had expected that, that would be a little bit -- I think we -- I think I probably expected that might have been a little bit weaker in Europe than it has been. So I think we've been gratified to see the results there. TAS in Europe has really just performed incredibly well again. So when we look at it overall, I don't think we're necessarily encouraged by the macroeconomic results in Europe, but our businesses are holding up a little better than we had expected.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Question for you about the enrollment season and selling season for January 1, 2016, starts. You had talked in the last conference call and the Analyst Day about how conversations in that selling season began much earlier. And obviously, the OPERS announcement underscores that. Where do you think -- how our things progressing right now? And does the OPERS announcement kind of maybe prompt some of those discussions to some earlier resolution as your potential customers see your queue kind of getting busy?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. We haven't actually seen that occurring from the OPERS things. But we have been -- since we've been out talking to clients and since we've been having this dialogues much earlier than we did in prior years, we've been encouraging people not to just take the fact that they started longer to mean we have a longer dialogue, but to take the earlier start as a chance to reach some conclusions about what they like to do so that we can get the lineup set, maybe earlier in the year. And one of the things we talk to clients about is, if there is a very big wave, we can promise those who decide in the first part of the year that they can -- we can accommodate them. We can't necessarily do that if it gets to be late in the year. So we've been encouraging people to think about things earlier. But I mean, we'll have to see how that plays out.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "As a follow-up, since you kind of intimated a theoretical throughput in your response, how many people could you enroll next year before you kind of had to go to a client and say, we might -- we're approaching full?", "John J. Haley", "I don't know what that answer is. I think the -- what I was really trying to get to was if we didn't have -- if we were nowhere near capacity, we would certainly probably contemplate taking somebody on later in the year than we might otherwise. But there's a lot of things that would impact that. I mean, part of it might be the complexity of their client. As we've mentioned in the -- for clients that we're implementing on Liazon, we actually would take them up to about Thanksgiving. But for clients that we were -- that were more complex that we're implementing, we might need an answer by July -- a commitment by July or so.", "Tobey Sommer - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then one last question about some of the data you gave on cost savings, $1,400 per active employee including, I think, you said $500 flows through the employee. Is that something that you think was a feature of this early phase of Active employee enrollments? Or do you think that customers are intending to share this about 1/3 of the cost savings with the employees?", "John J. Haley", "I don't know. We see employers adopting different approaches. There are some that are clearly interested in sharing a significant part of the savings with the employees. Some who are driven to looking at this, because of some severe cost pressures, want to keep all or most of it. And how that will play out over time, I'm not really sure. I do think, to the extent that employers are doing this, they're getting significant savings and they're doing it -- it makes any kind of change which you, moving to an exchange, is a bit of a change. It makes it a little bit easier. But I think our job is to make sure that we make the plans as efficient as we can and then the employer really tells us how they want to split it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Volshteyn.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to follow-up on the competitive environment. Just looking at recent transactions, Aetna purchasing the health care exchange platform. How should we think about the -- all the technology plays in the segment? And is it really -- are they really competing for the same business as you are?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. So I think there are different -- some of these are different. I think one of the most recent acquisitions we just saw was one that had an exchange component to it but also had a lot of just health care administration that was being done. I think there are some folks out there that we think do a nice job of either plan administration or running some exchanges. When we purchased Liazon last year, we were looking at, I guess, last year right around this time was when we purchased Liazon. When we did that we went through a very extensive review of all the different providers out there. And we were quite convinced that Liazon was hands down better than all the others. And we've seen nothing to make us change that opinion.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's helpful. And Roger, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments. You've tweaked up Benefits revenue guidance in constant currency. But it was brought down on the reported numbers. Is it all due to foreign exchange? Or is there anything else that's in there?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. It's really -- I noted the change in foreign exchange and that would be the impact there.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And do you have your assumptions for the second quarter guidance as far as euro and the pound?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. We haven't provided that. And I don't have it off hand. So what we provide is the full year FX guidance. So we don't have a specific guidance for the second quarter on FX.", "Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Understood. And the last question. There is a change in your line -- in differences in allocation methods that went up significantly. What's in that line?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. We -- so that's where we have -- like all companies, or most companies at least, we have an internal cost allocation methodology down into the businesses. You -- and I think you see, although I think the number did increase as you noted, a fair amount we're typically positive in that line in the first quarter. It's really a result -- what we allocate is budgeted costs and we actually we're typically -- in costs that we're going to allocate, we're typically under budget in the first half. I think, broadly, we've talked quite a bit over the last year or 2 about efficiency initiatives that we have kicked off which, again, are driving improvements in EBITDA margin. And I would say that these numbers you see here in the cost over allocations are indicative of the momentum that we have around cost control.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Tong.", " Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "It's George from Piper. Based on the tone of conversations you're having with employers on the Active side, can you comment on whether you're seeing the traction that supports your existing view on expected adoption rates? And then discuss how your expectations for Exchange enrollments for fiscal '15 have evolved, if at all?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. So first of all, welcome, George. Good to have you covering us. I think, I'll maybe make a comment and see if Roger wants to add anything about our guidance and our view. But I think the conversations we've had with employers so far, I don't think have done anything to alter the views we've had about the market and how it's going to unfold. We're gratified that the really 1/1/2016 season started early because we think that's important in making big decisions like this for employers to have plenty of time to think about it. But there's nothing there that is altered it, I would say, one way or another. Roger, anything you'd like to add?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. The only thing I'd say maybe just to put a broader context on it, we've done a lot in 2 years. I think we started off in the Active side with the expectation that there was an opportunity to add millions of participants on to our Actives Exchange. And we feel good about the things we've done. We feel good about the conversations we're engaged in with clients in the market. And I think the message, which we had at Analyst Day, which was we still see a big opportunity here. And as we've talked about earlier, that hasn't changed. So we know we have a lot of work to do and we're in the middle of it.", " Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "That's helpful. And can you describe your progress in scaling your direct sales force in your Active Exchange business, where you are now and where you hope to be?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I'll take that first, and then we'll see if John has anything add. I mean, so the restructuring that we did, George, in the -- to position ourselves in the Exchange Solutions segment back in the winter was all about providing that market focus, was about having the appropriate aligned sales focus for the different products. And also having the appropriate connections into our global client development group and -- that leverages the deep penetration we have into large and medium-sized clients around the world. So that's been a major focus of the group since we established Exchange Solutions as a fully integrated segment, and we're pleased with where that is. And I think the fact that I said that we have a good pipeline of activity there is indicative that that's coming together. I mean, I think, it will continue to develop over the near and medium term. But we're pleased with where we are now.", "John J. Haley", "And I mean, I think, George, the only thing I'd add just about the outlook for that, we did just recently release a survey where nearly 1 in 4 employers said that private health insurance exchanges could provide a viable alternative for their full-time active employees in 2016. So we had 24% of them said that they could provide alternatives for their active employees as soon as 2016. Now that doesn't mean they are going to move or anything like that, but it does give you some indication of the way people are looking at that. And when you -- I mentioned earlier, the Cadillac Tax. I mean, the -- that is something that is out there. Of course, we don't know whether that will change or not. But the -- about half, 48% of U.S. employers are expected to hit the health care Cadillac Tax in 2018. And by 5 years later, in 2023, 82% of them are expected to hit that. So there are some things that make us believe that this is a market that there will be real reasons for people to be switching to.", " Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Great. Very helpful. And then last question. At your Analyst Day, you guidance to around 10% NOI margins in the Exchange business for this quarter. You came in at 16%. Can you describe what surprised you on the upside or even downside this quarter with margins? And if you see any persistent sources of potential margin upside?", "Roger F. Millay", "Look. I think, if you go back on exchanges, they have performed very well relative to expectations over time. And it's not surprising for them to outperform. There were -- the revenue is above what we expected. The cost were a little bit lower than expected. This is a very difficult quarter for us to forecast because the ramp-up -- there's volatility around or a range of outcomes around what the cost ramp-up will ultimately look like for the annual enrollment period. And we're typically cautious in how we project that. So it's just -- I think it really comes back to good performance and good execution as they've built up for the annual enrollment period. And good execution as they -- in these off-cycle enrollments that came through and the revenue generation there.", "John J. Haley", "I think, Roger, we have also been helped by the model of having more full time -- keeping our best agents on through the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So on Exchanges, you've now got Ohio and Rhode Island. Do you think we're at a tipping point for the public sector?", "John J. Haley", "I don't know. We've always -- we've worked with a number of public sector clients, Nevada and Rhode Island. We did Louisiana, although that was on an open plan basis, which is not the method that we like a lot. And we've done other things, like local entities in California and other states. So we have a fair amount of experience with them. But a big plan like Ohio going is the kind of thing that I think will make -- will guarantee that there will be interest in other states too. So I don't know if it's quite a tipping point, Sara, but we're really quite encouraged by this. And we spent a long time talking to Ohio about exactly how to do this and they've been great to work with. So we're very excited about the prospect of serving their retirees.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And then in terms of the updated fiscal '15 guidance, it wasn't as much as the first quarter beat. And I'm wondering if that was mostly because of the timing shift you mentioned in the Health and Welfare business in the Exchange segment or is it something else?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well -- and I think, Sara, it was not just the Health and Welfare Administration, it was that as well as Retiree that were driving -- that drove that excess of that beat.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "But as I -- but Retiree, presumably, continues now that you have those lives signed up. Maybe if you could give us more color around your thinking around fiscal '15 guidance in light of the nice beat that you had in the first quarter.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I think -- look. The momentum is very good. I think, as you say, that as participants come in, in the off-cycle, if they -- whether it's the Administration business or Retiree, that's indicative of positive momentum for the year. So we did -- we've reflected that, I guess, overall in our expectations for the year. And I'd say that if it continues, obviously that's a trend that could lead to further outperformance.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then you had talked last quarter, I believe, about spending $13 million more in investment and exchanges. Did that come through?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. It did. It came in right around where we expected. So we're on track for the year. And I think we may have talked about this a little bit either last quarter or in Analyst Day. But those investments we expect will be similar in the second quarter. And then after we get past the annual enrollment period and the revenues start coming in, the level of net investment will decline in the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh.", "Matthew Hill", "This is Matt Hill in for Tim. My first question was around lump sum work and the expected slowdown in the second half of the year. Is there a structural reason behind that similar to couple of years ago with the rush to get work done by the end of the year? Or is it just simply a matter of not having the visibility into these projects quite yet?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. This really more of the latter, Matt. I think we saw a lot of people looking at lump sums and we thought there were be a number that would go around this time of year, and we don't have quite the same visibility into that for the remainder of the year. As I think we've mentioned in the past couple of years, the specific quarters in which we see spikes of lump sum work are really hard to predict. What we know is that it will probably add -- it would average adding a couple of percent a year maybe to Benefits revenues, but it will be lumpy in different quarters. But it's harder for us to predict exactly when that occurs than maybe just what the overall average might be over several years. So we think this was clearly a very good quarter. We expect to see bulk lump sum work continuing for the rest of the year. But we don't think it will be quite the same level but again, not great visibility.", "Matthew Hill", "Okay. Sure. And then in the Health and Welfare Administration business, talking about a couple of the projects coming in earlier. I just wonder if you can comment on any effect on the pipeline going forward. Or is there a lot of demand there for you guys to continue to kind roll through these projects throughout the year?", "John J. Haley", "So yes. We don't think that there's any -- that's anything that -- that there's plenty of demand, plenty of work. We've had some very good selling seasons over the last year or so in the Health and Welfare Administration work. We've been taking on a great deal of extra of that and we continue to see some good opportunities for future sales going forward. So we're not concerned at all about that. I mean, the fact that we were able to do it efficiently and do it ahead of time is something we feel very good about and it makes us more confident as we take on more work.", "Matthew Hill", "Sure. And then just one final one. The rates you're seeing on exchanges, are they still in the ranges that you had provided previously? Any differences there?", "John J. Haley", "No. No differences.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Mark Marcon.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "It's Mark Marcon from Baird. With regards to the first year savings that you've been able to generate on the Active side, can you talk a little bit about what the prospects are for generating similar savings for new clients that may end up signing up. Was there anything special about the clients that have been signing up that might make their experience in any way, shape or form untypical or atypical from what future signers might end up experiencing?", "John J. Haley", "No. So that's an interesting question, Mark. I think when we look at it, there's -- the employers that come to an exchange come in different flavors, sort of. So for example, take Towers Watson, ourselves. When we came to the exchange, we had already put in for ourselves all of the high-performing planned design features that we could. We had shifted to high-deductible plans years ago and had everybody on them. We had the right kind of pharmacy and management, we have wellness things in there. So when we came to doing exchange, a lot of our savings were around the buying the most efficient plan in each of the different 40 markets as opposed to buying the most efficient plan overall. And so we knew that our savings would be near the lower end of what they would be. If you have ones that are coming to an exchange getting the more efficient purchasing but in addition, also getting the planned design features, getting the pharmacy, getting wellness coming in there, you can expect to see a much bigger thing. We generally talk in terms of about a 5% to 15% savings. And we were -- at Towers Watson, we came in at I think 6%, so we were right near the lower end of the savings where we'd expect it to be. I don't -- we haven't really observed anything that the particular clients that have signed up earlier are necessarily any different than the others, we've seen them in all different flavors.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. So it sounds like that broad range should be applicable to virtually every other company that may end up signing up for you on a go-forward basis?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. We think that broad range should be applicable to them. And when we're talking to clients about this, we are able to go through and give them a pretty good idea of what the savings is that they're likely to get. And moreover, we do it accurately.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "In broad strokes, can you identify the -- or provide color with regards to the specific areas that typically end up leading to these savings?", "John J. Haley", "Lead to the savings? I would say that they're probably the 4 that I mentioned. There's the networks with the 40 pricing markets, which is applicable to everybody. There's the planned design, there's a pharmacy and then there's consumerism. So as I said, when you looked at it -- with Towers Watson, we had only the first ones because we had built all these other features into our existing platform.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And so even with just applying the first one, you could still generate 6% savings?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. We tend to talk of 4% or 5% as the minimum, but yes. And even that depends if somebody is -- Towers Watson is a company that's in a lot of different markets around the country and so we can get that. If you have somebody who's all in one location in one city then, obviously, you're not getting any effect from that.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And you've just formed, relatively recently, a sales team to discuss the benefits of these exchanges in a really organized manner. Can you talk a little bit about some of the traction that they're getting and that you're seeing? And the comprehension of these very significant benefits. How -- what's the reception among some of the larger organizations that could potentially end up being the blue chips that tip things.", "John J. Haley", "Yes. I mean, I think there's probably really not much to add, Mark, from what we've said before about that. The savings -- the potential savings that are out there are extraordinarily attractive to potential clients. And it gets their interest, it gets meetings, it gets consideration. Change is always difficult and particularly, change to health care plans. So -- and of course, when you run through the list of what's driving savings, the greater savings comes to those companies that have more change involved with them. And so that -- the people have to think about that. But we are -- we're seeing a lot of interest and we continue to see interest. We have virtually nobody that we've dealt with last year that said they didn't want to continue to pursue it. It was more just a matter of wanting to study it further. And I think the other thing -- the only thing that's probably changed more recently is that we've now come out with what our cost increases have been for the people who are -- who would have been the Exchange clients. And that 1.8% compares pretty favorably to what they would see in other environments.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Do you think that's primarily due to the greater level of consumerism?", "John J. Haley", "I think that's a big part of it. We have -- I think our exchanges are very well designed. I mentioned as I was going through the script, the focus of our folks on that, the focus of our folks on putting client needs first and designing exchanges to serve them. I mean, I think that's what really drove those savings or that -- those cost increases being held down the way they were.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And if could ask one lump sum question. With regards to the nature of the lump sum projects that you got done during the first quarter and those that you're going to be doing here in the second quarter, can you talk about the magnitude or size of those, and what sort of impact that might end up having on the recurring work once the lump sum program has gone through. Obviously, there's been some in the press that have been really large and some that are more modest. So I was just wondering the ones that you've done, what are you seeing?", "John J. Haley", "I don't have good color on -- I mean, we have good color on the overall numbers, but the breakdowns of how many are in what. I would say this though, to maybe be responsive to the second part of your question, we don't see bulk lump sum work as something that tends to be affect our ongoing revenues too much. Because the bulk lump sums when you do them, you're taking out people who are the near term recipients of payments from the plans anyway. The plan continues to exist for the same time that it would have anyway. It continues to need all the same kind of services. So we don't see much impact at all from that, on ongoing work.", "John J. Haley", "Okay. Well, I guess that is it. So let me just say thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to reviewing our second quarter results with you in February.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I would now introduce your host for today's conference, Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Aida Sukys", "Thank you very much. Good morning, and welcome to the Towers Watson's earnings call. I'm here today with John Haley, Towers Watson's Chief Executive Officer; and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to our website for this morning's press release. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay via telephone for the next 2 days by dialing (404) 537-3406, conference ID 64578329. The replay will also be available for the next 3 months on our website.", "This call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of the forward-looking statements and the risks and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated by forward-looking results, investors should review the forward-looking statements section of the earnings press release issued this morning, a copy of which is available on our website at www.towerswatson.com as well as other disclosures under the heading of risk factors and forward-looking statements in our most recent Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this earnings call.", "During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. For a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures under Regulation G to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release and the accompanying financial tables we posted on our website this morning. After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions.", "Now I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John J. Haley", "Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we'll review our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "Before diving into the detailed results, I'd like to say that the record-breaking results posted for the second quarter are a testament to the thought leadership, hard work and innovation of our associates. These results don't just represent the actions that took place this past quarter, but reflect the culmination of many years of hard work in developing new products and services, building a culture of collaboration, and most of all, putting clients first, which has helped us better understand the marketplace and how we can help our clients succeed.", "For a second consecutive quarter, we've posted record-high organic revenue growth. Reported revenues for the quarter were $958 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year's second quarter reported revenues and up 11% on an organic and constant currency basis. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. Strong top line results and the continued focus on cost efficiencies have helped drive EBITDA margins to a record high. Our EBITDA for the quarter was $211 million or 22% of revenues. The prior year second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $172 million or 19.4% of revenues. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.57, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.73.", "The strong momentum we experienced in the first fiscal quarter built to produce even stronger results in the second fiscal quarter. The Benefits, Talent and Rewards and Exchange Solutions segments delivered strong results. Bulk lump sum, health care consulting and pension administration drove revenue growth in the Benefits segment. An increase in client work and timing of survey delivery drove the Talent and Rewards segment revenue growth. An increase in the client portfolio drove OneExchange revenue growth, which along with increased client work in Health and Welfare administration, drove revenue growth in the Exchange Solutions segment.", "I'm also very excited about the launch of Towers Watson's independent defined contribution master trust in the U.K. The recent changes in U.K. pension auto-enrollment and defined contribution plan flexibility have created a significant market opportunity. By utilizing the deep expertise of our Towers Watson associates in pension administration governance, communication and investments and by working in partnership with our clients, we believe we've developed a unique and compelling market offering. The U.K. master trust is aimed at sponsors looking for independent governance, cost effectiveness and a quality member experience. It allows for a larger scale pooling of assets than the traditional single-employers trust, resulting in economies of scale that benefit both employers and members.", "We continue to make excellent progress in building our Global Health and Group Benefits business. Based on our internal operations and our brokerage partner, BrokersLink, we can address our clients' insured benefits needs in more than 100 countries today. We're also about to launch the Liazon platform for global access, our prepackaged benefits platform in more than 30 countries. These new offerings are another example of Towers Watson's commitment to sustainable growth through our culture of innovation.", "Now let's look at the performance of each of our segments. As a reminder, the results for the Benefits and the Exchange Solutions segments have been updated to reflect the expansion of the Exchange segment. Please refer to our 8-K SEC filing on September 16, 2014, for a historical quarterly view of the impacted results.", "On an organic basis, Benefits revenues increased 10%; Risk and Financial Services decreased 1%; Talent and Rewards increased 11%; and Exchange Solutions increased 39%. The Benefits segment delivered outstanding results across the board, with strong market development, growth execution and margin delivery. For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $488 million. Retirement revenues increased by 9% on a constant currency basis due to increased bulk lump sum work and increased consulting work related the change in the actuarial mortality tables.", "Health and Group Benefits revenues grew 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by demand from existing and new clients for plan management consulting and special projects. Technology and Administration Solutions revenues increased by 15% on a constant currency basis due to bulk lump sum projects and new client work. We have recently won 6 new large pension administration clients, which are in various stages of the implementation phase. This business is in a really strong place for us in terms of market demand. We continue to expect that the Benefits segment will show solid growth for the full fiscal year. But as we've noted in our previous calls, we expect more typical growth in the second half of the fiscal year as bulk lump sum project activity slows.", "Now let me turn to Risk and Financial Services. For the quarter, the Risk and Financial Services segment had revenues of $154 million as compared to $161 million for the second quarter of fiscal '14. Revenues were down 1% on a constant currency basis due to softness in EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions. Risk Consulting and Software revenues increased 1% on a constant currency basis. Revenue growth in EMEA and the Americas was partially offset by softness in Asia Pacific.", "Investment had a 4% constant currency revenue decline. We continue to see a slowdown in project work in EMEA and Asia Pacific. However, we won several new assignments during the quarter, which will impact revenues in the second half of the year. The Risk Consulting and Software and Investment businesses are both heavily weighted in EMEA. And based on a number of factors, including economic conditions and market performance, we may see some volatility for the rest of the fiscal year. We expect the pipeline in Asia Pacific to stabilize.", "Now let's move onto Talent and Rewards, which also delivered very strong results for the quarter. The Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $184 million. Revenues increased 11% on a constant currency basis. Executive compensation revenues were up 7% on a constant currency basis, with all regions posting growth. The primary drivers for growth in the Americas and EMEA included IPO and M&A activity. Asia Pacific's growth was driven by these items and by regulatory changes in China.", "Data, Surveys and Technology revenues increased by 11% on a constant currency basis. As we discussed in the first quarter, the planned timing of survey delivery drove revenue growth, but we're also seeing growth in the HR software market overall. All practice areas in Data, Surveys and Technology experienced growth this past quarter. Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues increased 14% on a constant currency basis. All regions posted double-digit constant currency revenue growth. The growth was driven by a strong enrollment season in the Americas, M&A activity in the U.K. and a strong pipeline of new client work throughout much of the Asia Pacific region. We like the growth momentum in Talent and Rewards and expect similar results in the second half to what we've seen in the first half of the fiscal year.", "Lastly, I'd like to move to the Exchange Solutions segment. For the quarter, the Exchange Solutions segment had revenues of $94 million, an increase of 42% on a constant currency basis. Our Retiree and Access exchange revenues increased 56%. Health and Welfare Administration grew 17%. Active Exchanges contributed modestly to the overall growth as we continue to build that business. This quarter, we completed another very strong 2015 annual enrollment period and are extremely pleased with the operational results. We enrolled more than 160,000 retirees, with the highest satisfaction scores in our history. The broad adoption of OneExchange Retiree by brand-name companies are strong operating metrics and client satisfaction results, we believe continue to solidify our leadership in this market.", "We enrolled approximately 60,000 employees on our Active Exchange and more than 80 Health and Welfare Administration clients with over 2 million employees or approximately 4 million covered lives with 97% participation satisfaction. Employees noted that they like the choice afforded them by OneExchange. We're also gratified about the very positive feedback we've received from our OneExchange Active employers. We've booked off-cycles enrollments for OneExchange Retiree for the balance of FY '15 and a large Active off-cycle client enrollment effective as of April 1. We'll also continue to market and enroll employees via the Broker channel during the balance of FY '15.", "We continue to expect to have approximately 1.2 million members in our OneExchange platform by the end of fiscal year '15. At this midyear point, it seems that Retiree enrollments could exceed our expectations for the year and Active enrollments could lag our target. While we have a lot of client activity in our Actives pipeline, the market is continuing to slowly work its way through the complexity of the transitional decision-making process.", "Revenue growth in the Health and Welfare Administration line of business is a result of new client projects and a number of special onetime assignments, which clients wanted completed by calendar year end. As a result, some revenues may have been accelerated into the second quarter. There continues to be a strong sales pipeline. We feel confident in the long-term growth in each of the lines of business in this segment.", "So we had a great second quarter, and I'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work. So much of our client work is tied to calendar year-end deadlines, and I'd especially like to acknowledge those associates who had to work through the holiday season. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Tricia Gwin, Towers Watson's Risk and Financial Services Managing Director. After a long and distinguished career with our company, she's decided to retire at the end of this fiscal year. Tricia has provided tremendous leadership and has made numerous contributions to the company. Although Tricia is not leaving just yet, on behalf of the entire Towers Watson community, I'd like to recognize and thank her for her many contributions.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger F. Millay", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd also like to add my thanks and congratulations to our associates for another great quarter.", "Now let's turn to the financial overview. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition accounting costs. For the quarter, the Benefits segment delivered a 36% NOI margin, up from 30% last year. Bulk lump sum projects drove margin growth for both the Retirement and the Technology and Administration lines of business. This was a tremendously impressive quarter for the Benefits team. They really stretched themselves to deliver great results on the top line and in profitability.", "Risk and Financial Services had a 27% NOI margin, an increase from 21% last year, showing a strong benefit from restructuring in fiscal '14. This is now the fourth consecutive quarter where margins have exceeded prior year comparisons. Talent and Rewards had a 37% NOI margin as compared to 31% in last year's second quarter. Revenue growth fell directly to margin as expenses were tightly managed in the quarter. The second quarter margin benefited from the strong shift of data services seasonal revenue into the second quarter this year. Exchange Solutions had a 13% NOI margin compared to 5% in last year's second quarter.", "OneExchange Retiree and the Health and Welfare Administration businesses drove margin growth for the segment. OneExchange Retiree experienced a significant increase in margin compared to the prior year. Last year, they experienced a loss of 18% in the second quarter as compared to an NOI margin of 23% this past quarter while enrolling a comparable number of members. The change in profitability was driven by new staffing models, continuous improvement initiatives, increased off-cycle enrollments and an increased client base. The Exchange Solutions margin also reflected continuing investments in building OneExchange Active. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter was $110 million. Adjusted net income was $122 million. The tax rate for continuing operations for the quarter was 33%. We continue to maintain our full year tax rate expectation of 33% to 34%.", "Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. At December 31, we had $640 million in available cash. Virtually all of the available cash and short-term investments are outside the U.S. As of December 31, free cash outflow was $31 million as compared to free cash outflow of $59 million in fiscal '14. For the second quarter of fiscal year '15, our free cash flow was $191 million as compared to $119 million for the second quarter of fiscal '14.", "Free cash flow generally improves through each consecutive quarter of the fiscal year. We continue to anticipate free cash flow to be in the neighborhood of adjusted net income. We had $50 million of borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter. This is down from $135 million in the first quarter. We repurchased approximately 400,000 of our shares for about $44 million under our $300 million share repurchase authority. At our current pace, we would complete this program by the end of fiscal '16.", "Let me now turn to the fiscal '15 guidance. I think the headline is that despite some pretty strong currency fluctuation headwinds, we're holding our revenue guidance and increasing our adjusted EPS guidance. Our full year revenue expectation continues at approximately $3.6 billion, which reflects the absorption of an estimated $90 million in negative currency fluctuations. We absorbed approximately $14 million negative currency fluctuations in the first half of the fiscal year, and expect to absorb an additional $40 million in the third quarter and $37 million in the fourth quarter. Due to the very strong results in the first half of the fiscal year, we're increasing our fiscal '15 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be within the range of $5.90 to $6. We expect our EBITDA margin for the year to be between 20% and 20.5%. We continue to expect the fiscal '15 income tax rate to be in the range of 33% to 34%. This estimated range does not include the impact of potential tax examinations or other items that could settle during the fiscal year.", "For the fiscal year, our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of $1.56 to the British pound and $1.20 to the euro. In our previous fiscal '15 guidance, we estimated $1.62 to the pound and $1.28 to the euro. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be between $70 million and $70.3 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share will continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share. We continue to expect the Benefits segment to have mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth. As we've discussed in this call and previous calls, we expect the demand for bulk lump sum projects to decrease significantly from the levels attained in the first half of the fiscal year. The NOI margin for Benefits is expected to be in the low 30% range.", "Next, in the Risk and Financial Services segment, given the current economic conditions in EMEA, where both the RCS and Investment businesses are heavily weighted. We expect constant currency revenue to decline by low-single digits or remain flat for the fiscal year. However, due to strong expense management, we're increasing our NOI margin expectation to the mid-20% range. In Talent and Rewards, we're increasing our constant currency revenue growth expectation to the mid-single digits. Given the strong results in the first half of this fiscal year, the current pipeline we see in transaction work and the demand for the overall HR software market, we feel more bullish about the full year for Talent and Rewards. We continue to expect the NOI margin to be in the low 20% range.", "Finally, in Exchange Solutions, due to the strong results in the first half of the year and the updated projections for OneExchange Retiree, we've enhanced our revenue growth expectation to be in the low 30% range. We continue to feel positive about the overall fiscal '15 OneExchange enrollments. We expect the NOI margin to be in the high-teens range. As a reminder, Exchange Solutions profitability is seasonally low in the first half of the fiscal year.", "In conclusion, I'd like to reiterate how pleased I am with the quarterly results. The thought leadership, work ethic and agility in driving strong growth and the productivity in unison is really impressive. Thanks to our associates again for a job well done.", "Now I'll turn it back to John.", "John J. Haley", "Okay. Thanks, Roger, and now we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "John, I have a question about operating leverage. What is Towers Watson doing in the Retiree Exchange Solutions to drive operating leverage over the near term and intermediate term? And what milestones should we be looking for to achieve operating leverage?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, I'll let Roger handle that.", "Roger F. Millay", "Sure. Sure. Thanks, Andrew. I'll start. There's really 2 pieces as you look at exchanges, Retiree versus Active. And on the Retiree side, and we referred to a number of the things in the script. But with the maturing of that business and greater experience and just handling the enrollment periods and the volumes that we've been at, we're seeing efficiencies operationally. And again, I think it was in John's remarks about the best operating metrics that we've had. And with that, we're just finding ways continually to enhance the leverage against cost of the number of people we can enroll. And that on top of the scale in Retiree is driving margins. In addition, with the off-cycle enrollments, we're just smoothing out the cost base and are able to keep processes consistent during the year and resources consistent during the year. And that's adding to productivity as well in smoothing things out. It's, of course, it's a different story on the Active side. We're continuing to build for Actives. We're building out our platform. We'll building out resources. And the operating leverage there is to come, because we're building for a much bigger business. So I think that's the story and it will be -- will drive over the next couple of years, leverage on both sides. But it will be more pronounced in terms of the margins that we have. It'll be more pronounced in the Retiree business.", "Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And you mentioned off-cycle enrollment earlier in the call. Is there any more trends towards off-cycle enrollments?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, very much so in the Retiree part of the market. And as we -- I think in the remarks, we mentioned one big one as of April 1 that we have for the Actives that's sort of an off-cycle enrollment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Piper Jaffray.", " Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Two-part question for John. First, could you clarify how many Active lives were enrolled during the open enrollment period? And then secondly, you noted Active enrollments could lag expectations this year. Can you discuss what could be driving this and actions you have planned to mitigate on the downside?", "John J. Haley", "Okay.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, I'll just take the number there. That's 60,000 Actives were enrolled.", "John J. Haley", "Right. And I think -- look, different things can -- we had one client that was -- we were expecting to enroll as of 1/1/2015. And they actually ended up deferring the decision until -- I think they've actually decided to go ahead with the exchange, but they're going ahead as of 1/1/2016. So that was a -- they've already signed the contract for 1/1/16, but that's one that got deferred. Another example is there's a client that we were -- that has implemented with us they're -- they were a big client and they've divested some operations. And so now we're getting fewer people that we had expected. So we're seeing things like that, that are affecting it at the margin there. I don't think it's -- we're not going to -- we're not saying we're going to lag behind by some really big number, but it will probably be -- the Actives will probably be a little bit lower than we had and the Retirees will probably be a little bit higher. We'll probably come out about where we thought.", " Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Right. And just to clarify, the 60,000, that's employees, if you express that in terms of lives, what would the number be?", "John J. Haley", "Well, the rule of thumb is to double that.", "Roger F. Millay", "And so George, just to -- and to clarify, because I know these are important numbers for people. That is the new enrollees, right.", "John J. Haley", "Right. Not the total in force.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes.", " Keen Fai Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Right. And then sticking to the Exchange business, can you discuss how your pipeline is building for next year's enrollment period?", "John J. Haley", "Well, I think, we're -- we have a very active pipeline. We have the -- people that we spent time talking to last year, virtually all of them are back now talking to us again about this year, the ones that didn't already implement, and we're seeing more clients talking about this. So I think we have a -- at this stage, we're very pleased with the pipeline we have there. It's just a question of how many decide to adopt.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "I just want to start a little bit on the line of questioning that we were on before. John, does there look -- just want to be clear, the commentary around the Actives might lag. It doesn't look like it changed in demand in the industry. It looks like just a couple of one-off things are going on that you mentioned. But can you just comment is demand consistent, demand picking up, just in terms of interest from potential clients?", "John J. Haley", "Yes. So I think first of all, Shlomo, that characterization is right. This is not some big change. We just wanted to highlight that it might be a little bit below. But it's -- and really, if I took those 2 client examples I mentioned, that would really be pretty much what the difference is between what we're estimating now and what we have. So not a big difference there. Overall, the interest is there. I hesitate to say much else than that, though. Because last year, we saw a lot of interest and then people decided to wait a little bit. I think we get a little different sense this year that people have sort of kick the tires enough that we would expect to see more people adopting. When we look at this thing, one of the things we have said we were targeting is we wanted to be about 25% market share in the Active market as it developed over time. We're at the 25% market share, it's just the market hasn't grown as fast as it would. And we can try to do some things to impact that, but we're really waiting for that to develop.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So it's still as we thought beforehand, just a couple things on the margin that are changing what are initially very low numbers is what it looks like.", "John J. Haley", "That's correct.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And you mentioned a little bit of pull-forward revenue into 2Q around projects. I know it's -- that kind of stuff is tough to exactly quantify. But can you take a shot at how much you think was pulled forward into 2Q around some of the different projects and things like that?", "John J. Haley", "That's hard to -- that's really hard to say, Shlomo, and it is really just an alert to say. We might expect that the growth rate is probably -- the growth rate just in the health care part of TAS is probably 1% or 2%, maybe higher, than it would've been in the second quarter. And it might be 1% or 2% higher. But as for the health care part, it's the health care administration of TAS that we're talking about here. So I don't think -- what I mean by that is I don't think it's a big material impact on overall Exchange Solutions. We're not talking about 1% or 2% on the segment revenue. We're talking about 1% or 2% on the health care exchange. But it could switch each way.", "Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Got it. And then just based on the types of clients that you have on the pipeline for the Exchange and the tire kicking going on. What do you kind of handicap the likelihood of a big marquee client signing up potentially for next year or like with the IBM thing was kind of a watershed event for retirees? What do you think the likelihood is we see something like that in the industry for Actives? Do you see that going up?", "John J. Haley", "Shlomo, the best I can tell you is it's between 0% and 100%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "My first question was if you can maybe talk a little bit about the competitive environment, how that's evolving for the exchanges, both Retiree and Active. How much of the client base that you're signing up today are existing clients versus maybe people you haven't done business with before? And similarly, how many existing clients are choosing to maybe go with a competitive solution and why?", "John J. Haley", "So I think -- look, it's a -- we're seeing -- in the Active part of the market, particularly, and increasingly, in the Retirees too, we're seeing a lot of RFPs for people who are considering exchanges. Those things are by their nature, competitive. There's a group that's invited in to see them. I think the -- when you think about the concerns of employers, generally, the concerns really relate to are they going to get a quality experience when they're adopting the health care and the exchanges? And so a lot of the competition is around that is what we're seeing. It's the who can deliver the right kind of experience there. What was the second part of your question? I'm sorry.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It was about whether or not the majority of people that you're seeing decide to opt with your existing clients versus potentially people that you haven't done as much of business with in the past.", "John J. Haley", "Oh, boy. It's -- so here's the issue, Andre. It depends on how you define that. When you think about it, of the large plan market, we probably already serve 75% of them in some way as clients. But if you're talking about are they people for whom we've done the health care administration part before, that's a much smaller service. So most of them, we have some relationship with where we've talked about them before. But it's probably, I don't know, broadly 50-50 between people that we've been doing some kind of either health care consulting or administration before versus ones we haven't done any of that.", "Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And the last piece, I apologize if you answered this in the prepared remarks. But any thoughts on the pipeline for bulk lump sum payments as we look out, say, the rest of the year into next year based on your conversations with clients and what you know about their balance sheets?", "John J. Haley", "So what we've done is we had a very strong bulk lump sum enrollment for the first half of this fiscal year. We're projecting the second half to look more like what it looked like a year ago, which is a decidedly down -- I forget the numbers. Roger, do you have that?", "Roger F. Millay", "It was down -- so we did about $50 million in the first half of the fiscal year. And we're looking at probably about $10 million or so in the second half.", "John J. Haley", "Which is roughly consistent with about what it was last year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Can you talk about how sustainable some of the project work around the mortality rate assumptions is? It sounds like that drove extra project work and is that something that's going to take a while for clients to work through or is that a really very short-term impact as clients adjust to the new kind of assumptions?", "John J. Haley", "That's pretty much a fiscal year impact that we would see. So you have to think about this and resolve it, and pretty much everybody will do it this fiscal year. I don't think we have any statistics to know how many people have -- whether there's more work to be coming in the second half of the fiscal year. And I rather suspect it'll be -- it was more the first half of the fiscal year than the second. But this is not a long-term continuing impact.", "Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then can you just talk a little bit more about investment consulting? I get obviously it's a tough environment in Europe. And you mentioned you won some larger projects, but the growth of this has just been choppier, I guess, there. And that business has been such a strong growth channel for you for a while. So I guess, do you still feel -- I mean, it used to be a high single-digit growth essential business. Can we -- can that business get back to there over the next couple of years? Or has it just reached the scale where we need some of the newer products like the fund of funds products to really kick in before we see growth accelerate?", "John J. Haley", "So I think we can certainly get back to the mid-single-digit growth in the investment area in the short term. I think we will be looking -- when we target high single-digit growth rate, it probably does require some of the innovative things like the specialized asset solutions that we have focusing more on that. We have a couple of things that have impacted the growth this quarter. We're not getting as much -- we had a lot of performance fees that we got last year. And we didn't get as many this year. We had budgeted for a slowdown in the performance fees, but it was a bit more than we had budgeted for. In terms of growth this year, we had projected winning -- in the U.K., winning 1 very large new client and about 8 to 10 smaller ones. We're on track for winning the 8 to 10 smaller ones. We're right where we'd expected to be for that. But we haven't won the big one. And the reason we haven't is no big one has come to market. So it's not that we competed and didn't win them. So there's a few things like that, that have just hurt us a little bit extra this quarter. It also was a tough comparison to last year, which was a very good quarter. So there's a few things that are coming in like that. It doesn't affect our view of this as a mid-single digit or better growth rate long run. But we think it may take another quarter or 2 to get back up to where we want to be.", "Roger F. Millay", "We're confident we're going to see a better second half than the first half.", "John J. Haley", "Yes. We think the second half will be better than the first.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Styblo of Jefferies.", "David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "First one, I just want to make sure I can reconcile the beat in the second quarter here with the guidance raise. Obviously, there's about a $0.20 delta. Sounds like some of that is due to timing of revenue that got pulled forward and also, currency. Can you better quantify what those are? And is there a sense that you're still just keeping some conservatism into the guidance? Or how do we walk that bridge to the guidance raise?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I think it's broadly -- so as John said earlier, there is some impact from what we believe is pull-forward, but it's not really that material. So I think roughly 80% of the delta that you're observing is FX. I mean, it's -- as I said, again, relative to previous guidance, there's, what was it about, $75 million, $77 million of revenue that due to currency changes that we pulled out of our forecast. So that's the principal thing driving the first half, second half dynamics.", "David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Going back to the BLF business. Understand your comments about the second half of the year. I guess, how do we think about this over the longer term, because obviously, the, I guess it was the Pension Protection Act was the catalyst for all this beginning to happen in '12, and I guess you got a bolus of revenue right away. That slowed down. Now it seems like we're having a pickup. Is that more the market conditions with the equity markets being so strong? And what's going on with the interest rates continuing to drive demand? Or how do we just think about this business moving beyond this fiscal year?", "John J. Haley", "So I think here's the way -- let me give you the overall view that, I think, we have at this, and then I'll talk about some of the specific factors that drive it. But overall, when we think about our business, we think about the Benefits business, which is a low-single digits, 1% or 2% growth rate in general. And then, with these -- there will be like discrete little lumps of activity that will occur as a result of bulk lump sum, which will drive specific quarters up from time to time. So it'll be this slow-growth business punctuated with these very granular activities of bulk lump sum activity. The kind of factors that will drive the bulk lump sum activity are, first of all, just the general desire to derisk the company's half, wanting to get pension liabilities off the balance sheet. Of course, we have larger PBGC premiums, which are encouraging companies to reduce their participant counts, because there's per-head charges that they get there. And those per-head charges are especially onerous for the terminated vested participants who tend to have low lump sums and low liabilities. So the per-head charge is a big portion of that. There's some concern that minimum lump sums will soon be calculated using a new mortality assumption, which will increase the minimum required amounts. That's driven some of the activity we've seen the last couple of quarters. And then, when the lump sum interest rates are at levels where they're at or below the interest rates used to calculate the liability for the company's accounting and for their balance sheet, then in those cases, you can -- you get some arbitrage that people are interested in. So companies tend to pay their lump sums near the calendar year end when that relationship between the interest rate used to calculate the lump sum and the interest rate used for accounting purposes can be estimated with more confidence. So that's why you see the bulk lump sum work in the quarter 3 and quarter 4. And so it's -- anyway, that's how we see it overall though. It's not something that we think we can predict with a lot of confidence that it's going to be -- if we look out in FY '16, we're going to see an event here or there. Although, we just know it'll punctuated with periods of bulk lump sum activity.", "David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then if I could just sneak in one, of course, on the exchanges here. How important is the Cadillac Tax in your mind for catalyst? I guess, it's -- the way I think about it is private exchanges are an alternative way to address that, but is that a big part of the discussion and driver as you're talking to employers to switch over to private exchange? Because I would assume they could do other things with their benefits to avoid that, but again, just want to come to an exchange because it simplifies the process.", "John J. Haley", "So we have -- I think we see a reaction of employers to that all across the spectrum. And indeed, I think even in inside Towers Watson, we may have some different views as to how important the Cadillac Tax is today. Overall, what we see happening though is that the -- I think for the most part, we see employers when we talk to them about the Cadillac Tax right now, they just say that's so far off, they're not thinking about it. We have a small group that is very interested in it and has us do a lot of analysis about it. I think my view is that the Cadillac Tax, if it stays in place, it will be a very significant factor about 1 year or 2 before it's about to hit, but not right now. And so I think you always get some people who plan a little further out. But most employers look at it and say \"Who knows what the law will be then.\"", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer of SunTrust.", "Frank Atkins - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "This is Frank, in for Tobey. Can you remind us the seasonality of the Talent and Rewards business going into the next quarter? And do you expect any changes from traditional patterns there?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. Frank, so the seasonality of the business is much more weighted to the first half of the fiscal year and lower revenue levels in the second half. A lot of that is driven by the data services business with the surveys being delivered in the fall basically. We don't expect a difference there. And so traditional kind of seasonal patterns is what we built in.", "Frank Atkins - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And on the Risk and Financial Services segment, there's some nice margin expansion there. Can you talk about some of the levers driving that and how sustainable that is going forward?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I mean, I'll comment first, Frank. So now, let's see, it was, I guess, over a year ago now that the business restructured to resize to where the market opportunity was. And so it's really been good cost management relative to revenue levels that's driven the margin performance.", "Frank Atkins - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, lastly, you've talked about the impact of M&A on a couple of the segments. If we step back and we assume kind of higher levels of M&A generally as we've seen recently, how does that impact the business across a few different segments?", "John J. Haley", "Well, it can have -- so I know we mentioned it, for example, in exec comp, and clearly, there's a -- when you're consulting on executives' packages and there's M&A, that's often a -- leads to a lot of work there. When you look at the Benefits business, whether it's Retirement or Health Care, there can be enormous projects when people have retirement plans or healthcare plans that need to be harmonized or modified in one form or another. When there's M&A, of course, in the insurance company area, that can have not just the impacts we already talked about, but it can also -- that can be a very significant driver of RCS revenue. And then finally, on Talent and Rewards, we have -- I mentioned exec comp, but in terms of employee opinion, employee engagement surveys, those are often very important things to help measure what's happening with M&A work and help get the kind of culture that you want going forward. So there's a lot of work that M&A can really affect virtually every segment we have.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins of Bank of America.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "It looks like Retiree revenue was up sequentially in the second quarter. And I'm wondering if there was an increase in enrollment that would drive that or was it more in pricing?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes, Sara. Yes, it was really off-cycle activity that happened in the first quarter, but then the revenue kicked in the beginning of the second quarter.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And so should we expect to see sequential revenue growth from the second to the third quarter in Retiree or should that be about flat?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, so that's our big seasonal quarter, right? Because of the folks who enrolled for insurance in calendar '15, the revenue cycle for that actually starts on January 1 of '15. So that's a big step-up period that we get every year from the annual enrollment period.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's what I thought. Okay. So that means that what we would then see on the Health and Welfare side might mean a sequential slowdown because of, you were suggesting maybe some of the revenue is pulled forward into the second quarter, correct?", "John J. Haley", "No. We were talking about -- we were talking there about the health care administration piece.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Not in the Exchange segment?", "John J. Haley", "Not in the Exchange. It's in Exchange Solutions, but it's not -- I just want to clarify, it's not the Retiree Exchange.", "Roger F. Millay", "Right.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Right, sorry. Yes. Okay, great. And then separately, could you talk about discretionary compensation levels for the rest of the year and how you're thinking about that?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. We still expect to be in that mid-30s kind of range overall for the year, maybe more like in the range of 35% to 37% as opposed to 34% to 36%, but still in the mid-30s.", "Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And then just last, again, in Risk and Financial Services and the cost management efforts given the challenged top line. Given that you have been really focused on managing cost in that segment for quite some time, I'm wondering, do you have a lot more levers to pull if you need to in the next couple of quarters?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, I mean, so the broad answer to that from a business point of view is we do have levers to pull to manage costs relative to revenue. I think we feel this level that they're running at now, which is as I think we said now for the full year, mid-20% range. I think, as I recall, it was like 27% this quarter. At the revenue levels that they're at, that's the margin levels that we think are appropriate to where the business is running. But we always -- we're always attentive to that relationship clearly.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I'd like to delve a little bit more into the exchanges. You've given us in the slide deck where we stood with regards to enrollments at December 31. Can you give us where we stood mid-January or end of January?", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, I mean, look, we're -- so in terms of -- are you talking about, Mark, sorry, new enrollments or just the total number of...", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Total number.", "Roger F. Millay", "Total lives?", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes.", "Roger F. Millay", "So look, we're around -- as we said, when you add the 60,000 of employees that were added for Actives and 160,000 of retirees, we're around 1.1 million in terms of total lives, so...", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Right now?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. Well, that's not marking like the 2 weeks, but it wouldn't have changed much other at January 1. So there's not a big change between January 1 and today, let's say. But it's around 1.1 million relative to the 1.2 million target that we had talked about.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All right. And then -- but we still have that big Active that is going to be signing up in April. Is that included in that 1.1 million?", "Roger F. Millay", "No, it is not.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And so roughly speaking, how big would that one be?", "Roger F. Millay", "I mean, I don't -- we haven't given a number on that. So I mean, I think it's -- if you think about other clients we've talked about in Actives, I think you can get a pretty good sense relative to numbers we put out there. But it's -- we haven't...", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "This one sounds like it's larger than some of the other ones that you've...", "Roger F. Millay", "Well, it's larger than -- again, if you think about the activity in Actives, it's one of the larger ones that we've had. I suppose it's probably fair to say, it's the largest one. But again, it's relative to the overall numbers we've given for Actives and the momentum we've seen there.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So the point is, I mean, we're still getting to that 1.2 million at least.", "John J. Haley", "We feel pretty good about the 1.2 million. I mean, we're at 1.1 million already, right?", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. That's -- I just wanted to be clear, because -- and it sounds like when we look at the Actives, originally, we were thinking, okay, we could get to, potentially, by end of the fiscal year, this was coming out of one of the discussions that you'd had in a public forum, potentially getting up to 425,000. It doesn't sound like it's going to be materially off of that level. Is that correct?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I'm not sure -- I'm not connecting back to that forum you're talking about. But I think what we see is consistent with what we've said generally, so yes, I think that's right.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then, can you -- let's go to the value proposition. You mentioned that the satisfaction levels are exceeding expectations as well as the enrollments. Can you give us a little bit of color there? And then, I just recently attended an exchange conference where I talked to a lot of benefits managers. And at the end of the day, they're still looking for bending the health care cost curve. Can you talk a little bit more about additional learnings that you've had with regards to year 1 savings, and then the inflation rate afterwards?", "John J. Haley", "Yes, so I mean, let me talk about that last part first. I mean, we've been extraordinarily pleased with the bending of the health care cost curve that we've seen so far. In fact, it's been a little better than we had projected. If you look at the most recent CPI we have, it's 1.5%. The OneExchange for Actives that we had, so our 2015 over 2014 was 1.8% increase. Surveys of mid-sized large employers with planned changes to try to mitigate the health care cost increase, that came in at 4%. Mid-size large employers with no planned changes came in at 5.2%; and Aon Hewitt reported their -- for their active health exchange, a 5.3% increase. So we feel pretty good about the positioning of the 1.8% against all of them and feel like it's a pretty good value proposition. And of course, by going into an exchange to begin with, you can have a onetime lowering of the thing. But you were talking about also bending the health care cost curve.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Right. And then with regards to like your 3 big Actives that are new for this year. Does it look like they're going to be on track to experience the year 1 savings that you ended up achieving with your first 3 big Actives?", "John J. Haley", "We see no reason not to. I mean, it's a broad range, Mark, and it depends on what you're starting point is. But we generally tend to think that we can offer people savings in between 5% and 15%. Those who get only the 5% sort of savings are those who already had the highest-performing features in their plan design. So for example, when Towers Watson adopted an exchange for its own employees, we already had all the best designs we thought in our existing health care plan. So we only saved 6%. I say only, I mean, 6% on your health care cost is enormous. But if you have planned design changes that you can make to high deductible plans and others like that at the same time you're making the exchange, that's when you can get up closer to 15%.", "Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then can you just talk about the satisfaction levels that you cited in the press release, a little bit more color?", "John J. Haley", "Well, the satisfaction levels, as we said, we've always been well in it, well ahead of what is quoted as industry standard for satisfactions on all of these. We've been well ahead of them. This last year, even though we had this enormous number that we ended up enrolling, we actually approved our satisfactions to the highest level ever. So we're just -- we couldn't be more pleased with the hard work that our operations guys in Exchange Solutions did. It was absolutely fantastic.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Quick one for Roger, then one for John. Roger, you're kind enough to break out Retiree margins for the December quarter. Would you want to just give us a view on what you think fiscal '15 will look like in Retiree? And then second, John, I think last year, some of the kind of gating factors on converting the Active pipeline as I read various surveys, there's sort of lack of maturity the business model, lack of data, clients not believing in the sustainability of the savings or basically clients waiting for their peers to do it. Have the sort of conversations changed or are those are still the things holding clients back?", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. I'll just start on the Retiree margin. So we don't break that out as you know. But Paul, you also know the business well. So you know that with new business coming in on January 1 that, that is incremental to the platform as it exists today. So we like the momentum there. There will continue to be some bumps up and down, depending on how large the annual enrollment period is. But again, the second half is the higher-margin half of the year for Retiree.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Roger, can I ask you a different way. What was the margin in the first half? Would you be willing to give that?", "Roger F. Millay", "Don't have that in front of me, so yes.", "John J. Haley", "So Paul, I think, look, it is the -- I think the same kinds of things are some of the discussions about are others moving, what's the maturity of the business model, what kind of data do we have. Things are better this year than last year. Because, for example, I just went through talking about what our experience is in the bending the health care cost curve. We have some data on that now that we didn't have last year. We don't have a lot more because it's still only a small number adopting, but we have some data, the business model is mature by one more year. And there are at least some people that have adopted it. So things are marginally better. I think the -- when -- I know earlier in the call we were asked about some projections about how many people are going to adopt this or that. And I think the thing that stops us from making any projections is to say we feel we have more things to talk to employers about. We have some things to address some of their concerns. The question is, do we have enough data and do people start to do this? I do feel that this is the kind of thing that there's a bit of a logjam and once we get a little bit of a break in that, we're going to see a big increase. But I'm somewhat reluctant to predict exactly when that will be.", "Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a final one, John. What's the -- how long do you have to sell for -- or what's the kind of drop-dead date for Liazon versus OneExchange?", "John J. Haley", "So I think with OneExchange, we're looking out, let's say, selling for 1/1/2016. OneExchange, we'd really like to know by June or July, I think, as to what we're going to -- the ones we're going to be implementing. For Liazon, we would be going up into the November timeframe.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Good quarter. And in spite of everything, a good guidance, I think. I guess my question is with regards to balance sheet. As obviously, you got some strength building and it's very supportive of future M&A. Seems like you have, in terms of the pieces you need for the Exchange business, you have what you need there. You've talked in the past about geographical expansion. You talked a couple other areas. Has anything changed with regards to the pipeline with the kind of deals you might be looking at? And then the -- I guess, the follow-up question is absent M&A, could you talk about sort of use of cash because you're heading into the more productive cash generation part of the year for yourself.", "Roger F. Millay", "Sure. So I'll just address the first part, and I'll let Roger address the second part there. So I think in M&A, nothing has really changed in terms of things we've talked about. I think we continue to be affirmed that we think -- we want to be on the lookout for potential M&A. We're somewhat conservative. We look at a lot of deals and we do a small percentage of the deals we look at. We always have some under consideration from small to large, but we're very much focused on making sure that any deal we do is a successful one. So I think we're continuing to do that. And no real change in terms of how we think about deals or strategically what we'd be trying to do. And Roger, I'll let you address the uses of cash.", "Roger F. Millay", "Yes. And I guess, Ashwin, just say that there really hasn't been a big change in the way we think about that either. So if you match what John said about M&A, we do like to maintain a reasonable level of flexibility. But we're not going to hoard cash. So you can see the run rate that we've been at, $40 million to $45 million or so of repurchases a quarter. We increased that run rate over the past year, and we'll continue to monitor that relationship as we go forward.", "John J. Haley", "And I mean, I think one way to think about this is we basically used up all the U.S. cash that we have in one way or another either by acquisitions or by repurchasing shares. And so we -- but we will -- we expect to be generating a lot more U.S. cash in the near term, so, too.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. So I guess that sort of begs the question with regards to your parts on repatriation of cash if needed. Any thoughts there with regards to upping the level of buyback in the absence of M&A and things like that?", "John J. Haley", "I think, as Roger said, we have that $300 million authorization from the board to do that. That would -- I think if we did it, the current rates would be finished at the end of 2016. And we anticipate that we'll go at least at the level we are right now. But we don't have any plans to repatriate cash.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then sort of a smaller question and then I'll let you guys go. It's a smaller part of your business. But any incremental impact you're beginning to see from Solvency on the insurance side?", "John J. Haley", "No. We're not seeing any impact from that right now.", "So thanks very much, everyone, for joining us this morning. We look forward to reviewing our third quarter results with you in May.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program.

If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Peter Poillon, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Peter Poillon", "Thank you. And welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call, which is being hosted by Dominic Casserley, Chief Executive Officer of Willis Group Holdings. A webcast replay of the call, along with the slide presentation to which we will be referring, can be accessed through our website.

Copies may be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on the call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release and slides associated with this call.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dominic.", "Dominic Casserley", "Welcome and thank you for joining our quarterly conference call. I must apologies I am at the tail end of a cold, so we will sound a bit nasally on the call. With me today are John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer; Steve Hearn, our Deputy CEO; Tim Wright, Head of Willis International; and Todd Jones, Head of Willis North America.", "Now I want to start our discussion today, by reminding you of the three key components of our value creation strategy. First, we will drive organic profit and cash flow growth through our diversified portfolio of risk advisory, brokerage and benefits businesses, with growth coming from across the Group. We are focused on delivering mid single-digit organic revenue growth. In parallel, we will manage our organic costs to create a healthy gain and organic margin.", "Second, we will manage our targeted acquisitions to create value through stronger revenue performance and improved cash flow.", "Third, we continue to transform our operational performance with our operational improvement program designed to deliver sustainable cost savings of $300 million from 2018 with a gradual process of cost improvement each year up until then.", "We expect that the program will add to our underlying margin -- each year as it starts to do in the fourth quarter or 2014. Combined, these three components will drive cash flow and shareholder value.", "Now the reason I remind you of these three components is that in the fourth quarter of the year we saw all three of them in action. First, our 3.6% organic commissions and fees growth outpaced our organic expense growth by 90 basis points and as one would expect, achieving this spread led to good growth in other important metrics, such as operating income, operating margins, net income and ultimately earnings per share.", "The second leg of our value creation strategy is inorganic growth. In the fourth quarter we saw the impact of our acquisitions. Our underlying growth, which includes the impact of acquisitions were 7.2%. You can see from that, how the acquisitions as we drive synergies over the next few quarters will continue to drive revenues and profits.", "During the course of 2015, you should see greater impact from Max Matthiessen, which closed in the fourth quarter and once it is closed, Miller Insurance Services along with our smaller acquisitions.", "Finally, we have the early impact of our operational improvement program, which contributed $11 million of cost savings in the year, an annualized rate of about $34 million.", "As the program get its momentum in the next 12 months, its impact will become still more apparent. So in sum, the fourth quarter results exhibited all three components of our value creation strategy in action.", "Let me now turn to organic growth. As I just mentioned earlier, Group organic commissions and fees grew 3.6%. The segment results, however, were uneven with one segment International growing spectacularly. While Willis Global was close to flat in some challenging environment and Willis North America was slightly down.", "The strength of our diversified model is such that we can deliver performance at the Group level when our business units do not hold the performance evenly at the same time. We have seen that throughout the year. You should expect that in every quarter some businesses will be stronger than others, but we expect that this some will continue to deliver good organic growth.", "Let me now give you a little more detail on each of the segments in turn. And first, we\u2019ll listen to International. Our International operations led the way this quarter, growing 15.9%, bringing their organic growth rate for the full year to a very good number of 9%.", "You know from our press release that this quarter\u2019s result had some tailwinds to rise from adjustments booked in the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter. But even without that impact, International achieved strong organic growth of 11% in the quarter.", "Obviously, the quarter\u2019s results are very pleasing especially given the backdrop of generally low-to-moderate economic growth across many of the regions served by the International segment. We saw a double-digit growth across almost all of our international region in the quarter, with a growth driven by strong new business wins.", "Now on this call last quarter, I spoke of the International segments growth trend outpacing general economic growth rates around the globe. This quarter\u2019s results and indeed the year\u2019s results demonstrate quite clearly that our strong market positions combined with discipline on how and where we compete in each of our markets mean that we can deliver growth of our trend.", "Onto Willis North America, North America was down 2.1% in the quarter which brings the segment\u2019s organic growth from the full year to 2.8%. You may recall that the segment face a headwind in the quarterly comparison caused by the non-recurrence of the $5 million positive revenue recognition adjustments booked last year related to its first alliance business. Excluding that adjustment from last year, North America would have been down by less than 1%.", "Now you maybe wondering whether the slight decline in North America in the fourth quarter is the harbinger of future weakness, absolutely not. North America\u2019s retention levels remain consistent in the low 90s and new business across most of its practices is strong. We are entering 2015 with a strong pipeline of opportunities which supports our confidence in the business overall.", "So weakness in this past quarter was for the most part isolated in two industries, the Real Estate Hospitality Group and Construction. Construction which was down mid single digits was driven by weak surety results and simply less construction project works compared to the prior year period.", "We remain confident that Construction is a real strength for Willis North America and indeed all of Willis. Positively, we saw good growth in our financial institutions and service industry practices. And I\u2019m pleased to say that our two largest product based practices, Human Capital and FINEX grew mid-single digits and high single digit respectively. Both of them also grew solidly for the full year.", "Now on to Willis Global where organic commissions and fees were down 0.3% in quarter. For the full year, organic growth was 1.4%. Once again, the quarter\u2019s results were in fact a blend of result across the components of the segment. Willis Re continue to grow solidly despite significant headwinds from soft rates and some reduction in reinsurance purchasing among the largest insurers. Its organic growth was in the mid single digits.", "Within the reinsurance business, Willis Re International grew double digits and Willis Re North America grew high single digits, with both continuing to win new business and exhibit strong retention levels. Overall, we were pleased with our reinsurance results in 2014. Innovation, analytics and strong client service have underpinned the business and we remain confident that this will continue despite the difficult market conditions, which we expect to persist for the foreseeable future.", "Willis Insurance U.K. declined low-single digits. Our insolvency in real estate businesses were down and two of our largest specialty businesses, P&C and Construction and Transportation weighed on the result. We had commented previously that the fourth quarter would be a difficult comparison for the P&C and Construction business due to a large project recorded in the prior year quarter.", "Soft market rates in transportation, which includes Marine, Aviation and Aerospace continued to impact results. Offsetting this was fully growth in our natural resources, FAJS and large accounts businesses. That is a relatively brief overview of our revenues for the quarter. I'm happy to report that we\u2019re making good progress on expense growth and John will take you through that momentarily.", "Importantly, lower expense growth coupled with our revenue growth in the quarter has underpinned an improvement in our key underlying metrics this quarter in including EPS up nearly 18%, EBITDA up nearly 12% and margins improved by 100 basis points.", "Now, I\u2019m going to ask John to take you through the numbers in a bit more detail.", "John Greene", "Thank you, Dominic. Good day to those on the call. I'll be working on the fourth quarter slide deck which is available on the website. Starting at slide three, this is a walkthrough of our earnings, taking you through reported and underlying EPS from the fourth quarter 2013 to the fourth quarter 2014.", "The key point on this slide is the impact of positive operating leverage with revenue growth outpacing expense growth, creating a $0.10 positive movement in EPS. This as you know is the first time in 2014 that the business has delivered positive spread in the slides, mid-single-digit organic growth and progress with expense management initiatives.", "Also included is a $12 million settlement for book of business in our global segment. There was a comparable $4 million in the prior year. Our reported EPS includes restructuring costs related to the operational improvement program which amounts to $16 million in the quarter.", "Turning to slide four which takes you through commission and fee growth by segment. The difference between reported and underlying for each segment is the foreign exchange movements. The difference between underlying and organic is the net impact from acquisitions and disposals.", "You can see that FX had a negative impact on Internationals and Global C&F when comparing reported and underlying growth. This was driven principally by the 10% depreciation in the euro against the dollar and the 5% weakening of the sterling.", "When you look at International\u2019s underlying results, you see the strong organic growth coupled with the impact of the acquisition of Max Matthiessen, Charles Monat and the IFG business yielding quarter-over-quarter growth of nearly 33%. In North America, the 4.9% decline from the prior year reflects the impact of our portfolio management activity. In the fourth quarter, we sold some non-strategic slow growth offices.", "Associated with this, we recognized a $13 million gain in non-operating income. On an organic basis, we expect challenging comparisons given the high growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. However, as Dominic said, we're comfortable with the outlook for 2015.", "Moving on to the total expense walk on slide five. Nonetheless, we adjust for $24 million of favorable foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter of 2014. The most significant impact as you\u2019d expect was from the euro and sterling depreciation. But we also saw most other currencies falling against the dollar. Underlying expenses grew by $53 million, of which $33 million was from acquisitions.", "You will notice on the slide that for the first time, we've isolated the impact of acquisitions and disposals on our expense base by providing organic numbers. Our organic expense growth was 2.7%. So our cost management initiatives and savings from the operational improvement program are starting to come through in our results.", "Slide six provides the similar walk of salary and benefit expense. Underlying S&P grew $50 million or 9.1% to $600 million. This included a $20 million increase from M&A. Excluding M&A, organic S&B was up 5.5%. Looking at the drivers of that growth, organic headcount was up about 1%. Salary increased, contributed 2% to 3% in line with inflation and finally, we saw increased production incentives in International tied to the strong sales growth.", "Turning to slide 7, this shows the S&B trend on an underlying and organic basis by quarter. There are three important points here. First, on an organic basis, the first half or the second half S&B is essentially flat. The second point is simply that our 2014 acquisitions added about $25 million to S&B.", "The final point is related to our headcount manager. Organic FTEs were up around 1%. Onshore FTEs including the impact of acquisitions are flat and offshore FTEs in Mumbai increased by 200 during the year. When we look forward to 2015, we should expect to see a continued focus in FTE manager.", "So you are aware. There will be FTE movements from M&A activity. We will also see a temporary increase in FTEs, as a result of parallel running of rolls that are being relocated as part of the operational improvement program. The costs associated with the parallel running is included in the estimated program spend figures we provided previously.", "So, onto our operational improvement program on slide 8, the full year 2014 spend of $36 million came in slightly below our last year estimate of $40 million. This was a result of lower than anticipated severance costs. Savings of $11 million are ahead of our $8 million estimate.", "Those savings were largely driven by headcount reduction initiatives related to organizational restructuring. Very little of the savings came from moving rolls to lower cost geographies. As I indicated in my FTE comments, the relocation of rolls will be a significant element of our 2015 work streams.", "You can see that we\u2019ve updated our key operational metrics for the program as promised. The metrics are the ratio of FTEs and higher cost versus lower cost locations, the ratios of square footage of real estate per FTEs and the ratio of desks per FTEs. The improvements are modest but it is still early in the program. What is important is that they are all headed in the right direction. Finally, as we reflect on the overall progress, we are maintaining our estimates with a total spend of savings. But we are very pleased with the progress today.", "Now, before I move on to EBITDA, I wanted to point out that we have included in the appendix a slide showing other operating expenses and the non-operating items. These are fairly self explanatory but I will be happy to answer questions as part of Q&A.", "Turning to slide 9, underlying EBITDA was $193 million in the fourth quarter, up more than 11%. For the full year, underlying EBITDA of $829 million was up little over 1%. While this is not where we want it to be, you know the story, solid revenue growth largely offset by expense growth. We anticipate that going forward, mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, supplemented by M&A and strong cost management discipline will allow us to drive EBITDA growth at a better pace.", "Turning to our corporate uses of cash and cash on the balance sheet on slide 10, in 2014, we invested in our future through M&A and return capital to shareholders. This included $241 million of M&A, $213 million of share buyback, $113 million of CapEx and $210 million of dividends, a 9% increase from the prior year. This represents outlay for close to $800 million, an increase of nearly $450 million from the prior year.", "All of these reduced our cash balance by just $161 million, bringing it to $635 million at year end. For 2015, our Board approved a 3.3% increase in the dividend, together with share buybacks of up to $175 million. The intention of this buyback is the same as 2014 to offset the increase in share count from the exercise of employee stock options.", "Turning to slide 11, here is a report card on the progress we\u2019ve made in 2014 towards our medium-term goals. We delivered mid-single-digit organic C&F growth of 3.8%. Given the deliberate investments we made in late 2013, we did not achieve a 70 basis point of positive spreads in the year. But we did made good progress in the second half and achieved 90 basis points of positive spread in the fourth quarter.", "Full year underlying EBITDA grew by little over 1%. As I mentioned earlier, we are not satisfied with that level of growth but again, we have good momentum and look forward to improving this. And as I just covered on the previous slide, we executed on all of our capital management objectives.", "Now, one final thought before I hand back to Dominic. As you know, we announced a few weeks ago that we had signed an agreement to acquire 85% interest in Miller Insurance Services. We expect that we will close in the second quarter subject to regulatory approval. We are excited about the prospect of joining forces with a leader in a London specialty wholesale segment.", "I know the analysts listening will be interested in the impact of this acquisition will have on the consolidated financials. So, I want to comment on a few things that might help you understand the transaction better. First, Miller\u2019s publicly filed partnership financial statements in the U.K. are not reported consistent with U.S. GAAP. So it\u2019s tricky to analyze it on its metrics on a comparable basis.", "However, I can tell you their pro forma standalone EBITDA margin is roughly in line with ours. As previously announced, we are not just holding Miller as is, we are transferring businesses both ways between Miller and Willis to better align our customer offerings. This, however, does create a bit of complexity but we will be transparent with the impacts.", "Second, as with all acquisitions in this industry, we are acquiring intangible assets. We expect to amortize those assets on a standard accelerated basis in line with GAAP. So amortization expense related to this transaction will be relatively high in the early years. To provide a little more granularity, assuming a deal closes late in the second quarter we expect it will be broadly earnings neutral from 2015 through 2017. However, when you exclude the non-cash impact of amortization expense, this transaction is accretive in the range of $0.04 to $0.06 in 2015 and $0.10 to $0.15 in both 2016 and \u201917.", "We will pay a little over 60% of the cash component of the consideration at closing and make three equal payments over the next three years tied to retention of key leaders. There is also a potential earn-out payment after three years based on superior performance. We assure you we will remain disciplined in our valuation approach. I hope this is helpful as you think about the impact of the transaction.", "With that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Dominic.", "Dominic Casserley", "Thank you, John. So to close, how do we see 2015? While market conditions are far from ideal across our industry, I\u2019m convinced that the balance of our diversified portfolio coupled with the continuous improvement in how we bring all of Willis to benefit our plans, we will drive future growth.", "This growth may not be evenly spread across all our businesses every quarter. But overall, we have enough growth engines to drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. I note once again that we are progressing nicely in our expense management initiatives. We finally lapped the investments we made in late 2013.", "We\u2019ve made good progress on our operational improvement program, finding ourselves slightly ahead of schedule on most metrics. That gives us all confidence about our ability to achieve the expected results. We will provide you with a full update on progress on that program with our second quarter 2015 results in July.", "And during 2015 you should see our acquisitions delivering more to our results. In that context, as you know, by the end of April, we need to make a decision about whether we intend to exercise our option to buy the remaining 70% of Gras Savoye we do not own.", "The Gras Savoye has franchises in France, Belgium, Eastern Europe, and Africa, with, as you\u2019ve seen from our Associates line, improving results in 2014. It is a potentially significant and differentiating addition to the Willis family. We will update you on our deliberations on that possibility towards the end of April.", "So all in all, notwithstanding some challenging market conditions and the fact that performance won\u2019t be even across every quarter, I am excited that the three elements of our value creation plan will work well in the full year 2015.", "Let me go over the three components again. First, drive organic profit growth. During the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit revenue growth despite the challenges in some of our markets and improvements in our organic margin.", "Second, invest strategically and in a disciplined manner in specialized businesses. For the year, we expect to see our existing larger acquisitions, Charles Monat, Max Matthiessen, and for part of the year Miller to deliver between $55 million and $65 million of EBITDA to the Group\u2019s results.", "And third, continue to implement our operational improvement program. Recall that on an earlier slide we reported that we expect to achieve at least $60 million of India savings in 2015. We will update you on that figure in July.", "At this time however, we expect that by the end of 2015 we will have completed projects associated with the program that on a full year run rate basis would deliver over $150 million of savings, that is half of our projected $300 million of savings.", "Now far from all of that a $150 million would impact 2015, as many of these projects only lead to changes in our cost base towards the end of the year or into early 2016. But overall, we believe the impact of our organic cost management actions, combined with the impact in 2015 of our operational improvement program, will allow us to deliver at least 130 basis points gap between organic revenue and organic cost growth in 2015, with more of that spread coming in the second half of the year than the first.", "Together, these three elements of our value creation strategy will drive growth in earnings, improve our margins, and increase our cash flow, all ultimately to drive shareholder value.", "With that, I will turn it over to you for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Cliff Gallant, Nomura.", "Cliff Gallant", "Thank you. I appreciate the comments on your outlook for 2015. I want to follow up a little bit. A competitor of yours discussed headwinds in 2015 from low interest rates and the impact of a strong dollar. I was wondering if you could discuss those issues as you look forward to 2015.", "Dominic Casserley", "Certainly, I mean, we -- it\u2019s certainly not a particularly interest rate environment, but I think most people presume that interest rates will be low. So we continue to believe that our interest income, which, in previous years, way back in time, was an important part of a P&L will be a very low number. We have obviously interest rates can also in some ways affecting pension valuations, we factored all that in. We know what that might do.", "As to the strong dollar, obviously our underlying numbers, the numbers that we often have you focused on, we strip out the impact of FX exchanges year-to-year and because sometimes they hurt us and sometimes they don\u2019t hurt us. So all in all, when we look at how our underlying EPS will perform, we factored in all the things you talk about into how we see 2015.", "John Greene", "Dominic, if I can add in terms of FX, we do see a little bit of headwind from the strong dollar. So if currency rates were to remain exactly where they are as of the end of the year, we would probably have something in neighborhood of $0.03 to $0.07 worth of pressure on EPS from a reported standpoint. Now that will be uneven in the year. The first portion would be or the most predominant portion would be in the first half of the year and then the impacts would tail out towards the second half.", "Cliff Gallant", "Okay. Thank you. If I could have one follow-up. The Miller transaction, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about it, about the strategic thinking behind the deal and why the structure as you\u2019ve done it.", "Dominic Casserley", "Yeah, absolutely. We are very excited about both those things, the strategic opportunity in the wholesale markets in London and the way in which we have structured this to retain the attractiveness of pound going into Miller. I am going to ask Steve Hearn to provide a bit more background about how we see this.", "Steve Hearn", "Thanks, Dominic. Thanks for the question. So Miller, I think here people would recognize generally in our industry has been the preeminent private London wholesaler and an opportunity for us to work with business that has consistently performed over many years in a partnership model. An opportunity for us to take an investment in that business and to participate in what we believe strategically can be quite interesting environment in the London Insurance market. There is about 200 insurance broking firms in the London Insurance market. And we are seeing a trend towards consolidation there and a flight to quality of client and team and carrier. There is a move towards more alignment around the stronger better players and clients looking obviously for more and better service.", "So we see an opportunity to sustain the Miller partnership and the Miller brand and use that as a way of accessing that particular part of the market. At the same time, we have history as Willis of being in the wholesale business. In fact, only a couple of decades ago, Willis would have been renowned as a wholesaler. We still have some core parts of our organization in London, which are wholesale in nature. And as we\u2019ve announced, we will be moving some of those businesses to sit within Miller and I think those businesses will be nurtured and grown very well by the management team in Miller. Likewise, there are some businesses within Miller that we think will work better clients, will be served better by sitting within Willis. And probably the best example of that will be the treaty reinsurance business in Miller, which we will be moving into Willis Re, which has been seen as again performed very well in 2014.", "Cliff Gallant", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is from Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Hi. Good morning. On your guidance for mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in 2015, that would be up from 2.9% ex unusual items in the fourth quarter. So could you just elaborate on what\u2019s driving that and how you think about the run rate by segment?", "Dominic Casserley", "Well, I can give you some generic view. We have been saying Sarah for some time that we see the portfolio businesses we have being able to deliver mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. And I think we made very clear how we see the early views on the North American business. We continue to believe we have a very strong North American business and we are very comfortable with the pipelines momentum we have in that business.", "You\u2019ve seen how International has now performed over long period of time, both -- benefits from both quality of our teams and their ability to win market share and some underlying growth in some of markets whose combination has been highly effective.", "And as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve announced a restructuring of Group into four segments going forward and so we have slight change in configuration what used to be call global. And we think that more management focus on different parts of global combined with the unwinding of some turnaround activity we\u2019ve had in the last 18 months, particularly in our U.K. business gives us some confidence that that we will see growth there too.", "But I would reiterate so what we said again and again, and I said in my call, it is the diversified nature of our growth engines, which gives us confidence that through the quarters we would lever mid single-digit organic revenue growth. Some parts will be up more than others in any particular quarter, but over the course of the year, we are confident where we are.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Okay. Thanks. And then on the amortization expense, after the close of the Miller transaction, what do you view is the right run rate for the total company\u2019s quarterly amortization expense?", "John Greene", "Yeah. So, I\u2019ll take that one, Dominic. So, we\u2019ll see amortization without Miller of some -- just about where we were in 2014. So we\u2019re expecting a mile uptick to maybe $57 million worth of amortization without Miller.", "And then in my comments I talked about the impact of the amortization on EPS standpoint with and without the amortization. So those figures, you can calculate those on the back of the envelope.", "Quite honestly, this transaction is subject to final closing. And as Steve alluded too and I talked about in my comments, the movement of businesses from Willis into Miller and some businesses from Miller into Willis will create a little bit of challenge in terms of trying to provide you a specific number on amortization at this point.", "We also have a final balance sheet throughout that is yet to be calculated. So I would stick with the guidance that that we\u2019ve provided. We were explicit and thoughtful in the way we did that.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question is from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.", "Kai Pan", "Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. First question is on the 130 basis point spread target for between the revenue growth -- organic revenue growth and organic expense growth? So it's great you have these deep specific goals? But what give you confidence you can achieve that? And in the case that your topline organic growth is below your mid-single digits target, given some market reasons, will you still be able to deliver that?", "Dominic Casserley", "Well, obviously, our 130 basis point margin -- not margin maybe the gap between revenue growth and cost growth organically that we\u2019re forecasting for 2015 is a mix of how we see revenues developing, how we see our normal organic expense management initiatives and the flow-through of the operational improvement program during the course of the year. That\u2019s why we have confidence in that number.", "Now, if you would tell me that our revenue growth was before well below the range of mid-single digits we\u2019re talking about into something you can no longer call mid-single digits. Clearly that number would be -- start to be challenge, but I think we would continue to believe, we will reduce the spread, but if you drive the revenues way, way down in any model you have, of course, you get less the spread. We don\u2019t see it that way. We don't see that way at all and we\u2019re very comfortable with what we\u2019re saying.", "John Greene", "And if I can just add there, there is one additional buffer there. So if the revenue doesn\u2019t come in the way we anticipated, our compensation expense of 20% is variable in nature, so its tied to production incentives, so that will also reduce. Should the topline not come in where we anticipated.", "Kai Pan", "Great. And then my second question is on your sort of cash and position. Given the acquisition you have done so far and also the pending Gras Savoye, you need to make a decision soon. How do you think of your cash position, given your projected free cash flow? Do you need to borrow more?", "John Greene", "Yeah. So when we look at 2015, we have an explicit assumption that Gras Savoye closes currently in 2016 should the Board authorized the option. So leaving that aside 2015, the way we\u2019re looking at the cash generation of the business even with the acquisition of Miller, we don't see the need to go out and issue more debt.", "There's a possibility that we\u2019ll pull on the credit line a little bit. As you know, we have a $800 million credit line. At the end pf the year, there was zero on that credit line. So there's certainly capacity within the business in '15 without issuing new debt.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. Great. Well, thank you so much for all the answers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Gelb, Barclays.", "Jay Gelb", "Thanks you. For the first quarter which is by far though the largest contributor to earnings seasonally over the course of the year typically, would you still expect the spread to be positive between revenue growth and expense growth, and possibly even better than what we saw in the fourth quarter?", "Dominic Casserley", "Yes. We, Jay, are forecasting our spread over the course of the year. I said it will be more oriented towards the second half of the year. But clearly, our expectation is we\u2019ll produce a positive spread each quarter, but it's very much going to be -- the overall number you\u2019re going to see in 2015 will be more weighted towards the spread performance in the second half of the year.", "Jay Gelb", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. On North America organic growth, in addition to tough comps year-over-year in terms of resulting in a slightly negative organic growth number in 4Q, is there anything else that you would view as a risk to not being able to show positive organic growth in North America during 2015?", "Dominic Casserley", "Let me turn over to Todd Jones to answer that one.", "Todd Jones", "Yeah. Jay, the short answer is, no. I mean, we tried to be very definitive about the performance in the quarter and what was driving that. And as Dominic talked about, the retention levels remained strong in the low 90s. Our new business performance is strong as well. So we\u2019re going into 2015, specifically in Q1 and the full year confident in the underlying business for sure.", "Jay Gelb", "Okay. And then final one for the share count for 2015, will the buybacks essentially offset dilution from exercise of options resulting in essentially a flat share count for the year?", "Dominic Casserley", "Pretty much and that\u2019s the plans. So we said what we do, Jay, is every year we look at -- I say every year, now we are now into the second year of doing this. We look at the share options exercise during the course of the year, so in this case during the course of 2014. And we\u2019re now buying back enough to offset that.", "Jay Gelb", "Makes sense. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank.", "Josh Shanker", "Yeah. Good morning, everyone. And Dominic, feel better you\u2019re not the only one fighting the common cold I guess. My question involves the $11 million you\u2019ve saved so far with the operational improvement program. Are these jobs that have actually been severed over the $11 million salary that you continue to pay to people until the time that you sever them because you identify them as severance?", "Dominic Casserley", "These are real changes to the positive results of the firm, right. So these are real exchanges to the actual numbers of the organization. So they are out and that\u2019s why we\u2019re saying that the impact of our action in 2015, you would see more of the impact of those in the second half of the year because obviously they only flow through the P&L when we stop paying people or their roles have been moved to a lower cost location and the roles that existed in the high cost location are no longer been paid for.", "Josh Shanker", "So when I see that you paid $16 million in termination benefit. Can I expect going into 2015 that a significant portion of that is run rate savings that you\u2019re going to see on a quarter-to-quarter basis?", "Dominic Casserley", "Could you ask that question again, didn\u2019t quite, didn\u2019t quite -- can you just ask it again?", "Josh Shanker", "Yeah. So far you\u2019ve said termination benefits, I think, you said $16 million -- you spend $16 million in termination benefit. In 1Q\u201815, if the vast majority of that non-repeating salaries that will taken out because you\u2019ve let those people go or how should I think about that $16 million what it\u2019s composed of.", "John Greene", "So, Dominic, why don\u2019t I take that. So, yes, for the quarter there was $36 million restructuring charges. Josh as you know $16 million was termination benefits and that broke down between North America, International and Global. And we anticipate that the salary associated with that termination benefits will have left the organization. So we know, for example, that there were approximately 300 people net that came out of the organization that can comprise that $16 million of termination benefits.", "So there is selective reinvestment in certain area which makes the comparison, I\u2019ll say dollar for dollar a little bit more challenging. And there is inflation as you know between 2% and 3% when you take a look at our entire organization. So you can think about this as yes its real dollars out, there is some inflation going up against that and there is some mild reinvestment. But intention is as we\u2019ve said and we weren\u2019t -- and so far we\u2019ve done a pretty good job in terms of executing again.", "And so the majority of the stuff is going to drop down to the bottom line. And as we said I think in my opening remarks that the cost saving we saw this year of $11 million, the annualized rate of those was $34 million. So that\u2019s I think a clear way of thinking about what the impact is.", "Josh Shanker", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just to understand by the time someone has been identified as a potential redundancy. How long will you be paying salary and termination benefits for the individual before they come out of the floor?", "Dominic Casserley", "Where they are?", "John Greene", "It\u2019s very specific to geography. So if you think about France, so it\u2019s closer to 12 months. Spain can be 12 months. North America is the function of time with the Group. On average that it would be somewhere between three and six months, in the U.K. it\u2019s typically six months as the average. Three to six, thanks.", "Josh Shanker", "Thank you for the answer. I appreciate it. Good luck.", "Dominic Casserley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "All right. Thank you. And the next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore.", "Vinay Misquith", "Hi. Good morning. The first question I was wondering, if you could give us color on the sort on in growth in North America and maybe to an extent global. To what extent, do you think it's just purely because of timing versus -- sorry -- maybe some concerns around the restructuring efforts?", "Dominic Casserley", "Todd, you want to talk about North America?", "Todd Jones", "Yes, sure. I think your analysis is around -- the timing is a good one. As we think about the North American and specifically which is why we focused our comments on the construction business which by nature due to some of the project related revenue. We\u2019re going to have some unevenness in terms of the performance of that business.", "We certainly don\u2019t think as we talked about through this call that there is anything to suggest anything other than optimism for 2015 about the business. And then, I think the impact of both the operational improvement program and some of the underlying strategies that we are executing on, I think we actually see those helping the business and supporting growth efforts into 2015 and as we think about years further out.", "Vinay Misquith", "Sure.", "John Greene", "So, a global perspective, so I think the question in there was with the restructuring efforts, anything to do with the economic performance in the quarter and Dominic can answer to that. It didn\u2019t drive it down in our revenue at all. But again, as I talked, we see the restructuring as a positive enabler for us is a business not an impediment. There are two parts to global. Firstly, the reinsurance business which is a global. And as you have seen, again had a very, very good strong quarter and particularly relative to its competitors and the headwinds that challenged it. Our U.K. insurance business as we talked about before is some of its parts. There are some things in there that perform very well in the quarter. Some which didn\u2019t do quite so well and some which really struggled both in the quarter and through the year. So, it\u2019s the number of different things driving the quarter results but it\u2019s not resulting from the restructuring efforts.", "Vinay Misquith", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just wanted to clarify that there are movement of employees that's really from a support staff perspective correct that\u2019s not really impacting being the producers?", "John Greene", "That is right. The operational improvement program is focused on overcalling the mid and back-office activities. And if you\u2019ve heard us described the program but the movement of staff is around people in those roles.", "Vinay Misquith", "Sure. And then just one last question, a numbers question. The tax rate picked up to 25% this year, so what's the normalized tax rate we should be expecting for the future?", "John Greene", "Yeah. So, I\u2019ll take that one. We expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 27%. It will be a function of the composition of the earnings throughout the globe that's why there's a range there. For planning your models, 25% probably not a bad number.", "Vinay Misquith", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question is from Brian Meredith, UBS.", "Brian Meredith", "Yeah. So, one or two quick questions here and correct me if I\u2019m thinking about this correctly. But if I look at what your planned expense savings are in 2015 of $16 million that comes out to about 2% of the \u201914 expenses. Yet you\u2019re only looking 130 basis points of kind of spread between revenue and expense growth. Does that imply that you expect underlying organic expenses to grow faster than revenues this year and if, so why?", "Dominic Casserley", "So we are obviously taking a buffer and therefore, how we think the year will turn out in terms of performance. But obviously as we said all along, Willis is a growth business. We have significant growth opportunities around the world. You should not imagine because we are focused on expense management, we aren\u2019t also focused on taking advantage of revenue opportunity in markets like China, Latin America, just a two examples.", "So we are investing against our growth opportunities. But broadly, we are very comfortable with where see the combination of all those things turning out in terms of our results and the spread we could achieve in 2015 and our continued ability to invest behind revenue producing opportunities for \u201915, \u201916 and beyond.", "Brian Meredith", "Can you elaborate little bit on the investments spending, the reason I am asking, Dominic is, if this restructuring program wasn\u2019t going on, would that be what\u2019s happening, that we should expect from Willis, longer term is it expense growth outpaces revenue growth, if you don\u2019t have some kind of an expense save program going on? I mean, the other program, just not the case?", "Dominic Casserley", "No. No. Our math shows that we are still achieving an organic spread\u2026", "Brian Meredith", "Okay.", "Dominic Casserley", "\u2026 without the restructuring program.", "Brian Meredith", "Without you are still achieving organic growth, okay.", "Dominic Casserley", "Yeah.", "Brian Meredith", "Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all.", "Dominic Casserley", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next question is from Thomas Mitchell, Miller Tabak.", "Thomas Mitchell", "Thank you. I have a couple of questions that I may just have misunderstood? But the $12 million in settlement proceeds that came in? Does that flow through to underlying earnings per share the $0.46 or is that excluded?", "John Greene", "No. The $12 million is included in the underlying. It\u2019s not part of commission and fees, its other operating income, just part of revenue. In the prior year there was $4 million related to a similar type settlement and in this industry, occasionally, when certain producer Group\u2019s or books of business end up moving in order to avoid litigation or lockup periods for employees, many times the receiver of those resources will pay a settlement and that\u2019s what we had in the quarter.", "Thomas Mitchell", "Right. But if we are putting a model together, we don\u2019t expect that every quarter, we don\u2019t expect settlement funds to keep flowing in every quarter?", "John Greene", "Yeah. I certainly would hope not.", "Thomas Mitchell", "Okay. Fine. Of course that means you lost producers, okay, fine. That\u2019s very helpful. Now the other question is also about other expenses? I just notice that and again, I -- you correct me, if I am wrong. But the growth in salaries and benefits on an organic basis was well above organic growth in fees and commissions, so that the positive operating leverage from the quarter came, essentially viewed that way from a reduction in other operating expenses? First of all, is that a correct way to look at it, and then second of all, going forward, what would -- what should we look for in that area?", "Dominic Casserley", "Right. Let me have overall answer that well. John, I guess, the numbers, the fee -- reduction in other operating expenses is part of our ongoing expense initiative and reflect some rationalization we did in terms of some of our specific branding spend we did in 2014.", "And we think that\u2019s a good set of scrutiny and initiative we did. The -- the salary and benefits numbers had some peculiarities in them, we\u2019ve shown we will go through related to prior year comparison and some specific incentives paid in International, which made the number look large when if you think about that.", "John Greene", "Yeah. Exactly. So in terms of, let me, start with other operating expenses. So other operating expenses did go down in the quarter versus the prior year quarter. As Dominic said, there were some marketing and brand-related expenditures that did not repeat in \u201914. There was also, just as part of our overall expense management, we took a look at systems infrastructure and we found a particular system that had market appeal and we didn\u2019t feel like we are the best owners of it. We sold it and we had a $3 million reduction to expense in the fourth quarter.", "In terms of the salary and benefit growth in the fourth quarter, it was 5.5%, as I said in my prepared remarks. I also included in the slide deck that page that shows that S&B from an organic standpoint between the first half and the second half of 2014 was essentially flat.", "The reason I thought that was important was because in the fourth quarter itself, in terms of the production awards, the International segment had a couple of triggers that took an adjustment in the fourth quarter up, it didn't exist in the previous quarters.", "So if we straight line that, had we had a perfect insight in terms of how International would have done, there would have been a much more smooth S&B between quarter and quarter. So that's one component of it.", "The other component of it is, frankly, a level of inflation. So we have significant operations in Asia and in Latin America the inflation rates in those countries are much greater than the U.S. or the U.K. So on a blended basis we have inflation of about 2% to 3% reflected in 2014 versus 2013.", "So one of the leverage that we are continuing to focus on is the FTEs that we have, they are big pieces of cost base. The operational improvement programs in place in order to ensure our FTE base is as cost effective as it possibly can and we are going to continue to drive those numbers.", "Thomas Mitchell", "This is very helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Okay. Next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Good afternoon. Can you walk us through what the acquired revenues look like for 2015 for modeling purposes? And also what the minority interest calculation might look like for the last three quarters?", "Dominic Casserley", "For the last three quarters.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Miller, I guess, won\u2019t you be taking 15% out, if you only on 85%.", "Dominic Casserley", "No. I am sorry. Yeah.", "John Greene", "Yeah.", "Dominic Casserley", "Yeah.", "John Greene", "Yeah. So in terms of the minority interest related to Miller, we are not -- we are actually not going to get in that level of granularity on this call. We haven\u2019t closed the transaction. We have a number of elements we have to work through.", "In terms of the M&A numbers, we have included within the press release detail of what those numbers are. Now typical convention when we look at these is that we will use 12 months of revenue as inorganic and then it falls off\u2026", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay.", "John Greene", "\u2026 and becomes organic. So an easy kind of analysis on that would be actually quite difficult for this call. And honestly, at this point I prefer not to go through that.", "Dominic Casserley", "We can go back to you, Bob. We have said, I think, what we think the EBITDA impact in 2015 of these acquisitions will be, right. And we can\u2019t give you the exact minority number against Miller, because we haven\u2019t closed the transaction and there are lots of moving parts between it, as John explained.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. I will -- I\u2019ll nail Peter with some follow-ups, but I think there is still\u2026", "Dominic Casserley", "That\u2019s fine.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "\u2026 an equation with too many unknowns, they have specific components to be reasonable. And this could impact margin analysis but certainly we can do it. Our more strategic question, you guys haven\u2019t given short-term guidance in many, many years and it seems to fly in the face of your sort of native instincts, the little I\u2019ve gotten to know you to put a target out there that we can shoot at. What\u2019s the tactical reason that you\u2019re going back to giving guidance and can we read into this that you\u2019ve got a level of confidence that you\u2019re seeing things behind the numbers that give you confidence that you can actually put a target out there to shoot for?", "Dominic Casserley", "The reason we\u2019ve done this is that you will remember that about 18 months ago, we had an investor conference and gave median term guidance on revenues and what we saw in terms of, I mean, the spread between our revenues and costs. We\u2019ve been very clear that in 2014 that we did pretty well in the revenue target, we certainly did not do so well on the gap between revenues and costs. And therefore this time we thought it was important that our markets and investors understood how we saw 2015 specifically operating on that margin spread given what we said 18 months ago. As to the second part of your question, as to confidence, we wouldn\u2019t have said it if weren\u2019t confident. ", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Okay. So we can look that you\u2019re going to be given near-term earnings guidance on a go-forward basis. And once you start giving guidance, you sort of have to stick with it, I think?", "Dominic Casserley", "What we were clearly not to be doing, Bob, is giving quarterly guidance.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "All right.", "Dominic Casserley", "And we will -- when we get to this call next year, we\u2019ll decide what we want to do in terms of again reassuring people about how we see the two key components of organic performance, which are how we see revenue growth and how we see the spread between revenues and costs but we\u2019re definitely not getting into the game of quarterly guidance?", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Thank you.", "Dominic Casserley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "All right. Our next question is from Mike Nannizzi at Goldman Sachs.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Thanks. Just a couple here, on the International segment, lots of organic growth there but it didn\u2019t seem like your margins really reacted that much. I\u2019m guessing there were some expense investments. Just trying to get an understanding of the operating leverage in that segment and how we should think about how much organic growth should help to support margin expansion there?", "Dominic Casserley", "Let me hand over to Tim to talk about the dynamics of that International portfolio.", "Tim Wright", "Thanks for the question, Mike. Obviously, we had very strong revenue growth in the quarter even adjusting for the revenue recognition change last year. And there was margin expansion but it was modest as you say. I would say not to repeat everything that John just said but I think he covered it because these are high growth markets. There are costs associated with that growth. But also we did have some exceptional incentive payments that were triggered in the quarter that probably narrowed that margin even further than you would expect it to be on an ongoing basis. So we are absolutely in the International segment looking to achieve positive operating leverage on the back of strong continued growth.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Okay. Thanks. And then, just on that nickel or so of other income, the settlement to that contract. I\u2019m just curious, I mean, so when we think about underlying should we be thinking about that is kind of sort of a run rate earnings and if so, it sounds like that\u2019s a one-time item. Is there a reason that we should think about that being part of what would otherwise be kind of interpreted as an underlying earnings number?", "John Greene", "So what we tried to do is be consistent with how we\u2019ve treated in the past actually. So I mentioned in my comments that there were $4 million gain settlement in 2013 fourth quarter. In previous quarters and previous years, those sort of settlements have come through other operating income. Now this is -- I appreciate, it is taking out. The quantum of the settlement is three times bigger than the number last year. So from my standpoint, these settlements means -- typically means some producers are going somewhere else. And in this case, they did not go to a competitor to be clear.", "So it\u2019s not something we plan for, nor do we budget it. So I would say there is a trend through history that indicates there will be some sort of settlement. Now I would expect that $12 million is in outlier.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Got it. Okay. And then just on the share issuance in \u201815 in the offsetting buybacks. In mean, is this something we should expect will continue? I mean, is there a backlog of options that are sort of coming through and so you kind of see or get some idea of how that\u2019s going to play out or is -- are we be going through the bulk of that if you do have that level of visibility in \u201815? And at some point we can think about buybacks reducing the share count, how should we think about that dynamic?", "Dominic Casserley", "Well, at the moment, we just had a policy unlike which is about offsetting that effect of share option issuance. That\u2019s how we set our buyback. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to manage it for 2015.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Yeah.", "Dominic Casserley", "So we\u2019re offsetting the \u201814 issuance in \u201815. We\u2019re going to monitor what happens in \u201815 in terms of how much we have and then we\u2019ll make another decision at the end of the year. But we made clear now, you can say it\u2019s 22 years, we made clear that our ingoing starting approach is that we at least seek offset that impact on the share count.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Got it. So we shouldn\u2019t be thinking beyond \u201815 that there's an opportunity for that share count to just net come down that we should just be thinking about the buybacks and share issuance sort of neutralizing one another.", "Dominic Casserley", "That would be an ingoing modeling assumption. Yeah.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Dominic Casserley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "The next question is from Meyer Shields, KBW.", "Meyer Shields", "Thanks. Good morning. I guess a couple of questions. With Gras Savoye, there was a $6 million improvement in your share of the results from fourth quarter last year to this year. Can you break that down between FX movements and actual fundamental improvement?", "Dominic Casserley", "Let me give, while John thinks about that. Let me give you some overall. So 2013 was an unusual year for Gras Savoye. They were doing their operational improvement program, if you like -- levels of it and those costs ran through all the numbers in 2013 and little bit into 2014 but mainly in 2013. And so we had some delta at that program that didn\u2019t affect the numbers very much in 2014.", "But nevertheless, the underlying performance of the business did improve and has been improving and we feel good about that in terms of each contribution to us. So that\u2019s the underlying what\u2019s going on. Now that we have John think about FX here.", "John Greene", "And I\u2019ve thought about it, Dominic and I don\u2019t have exclusive answer on that at this point related to Gras Savoye. The improvement as Dominic said from what we've seen both, looking at the financials from the business as well as the activities that have happened, there\u2019s fundamental operational improvements in Gras Savoye that is driving the improvement. But what we\u2019ll do after the call is we will post some information and Peter will get back to Meyer if that\u2019s okay.", "Meyer Shields", "Yeah.", "Dominic Casserley", "Tim, do you want to try to this? Tim Wright?", "Tim Wright", "Just a very small point. But first of all, obviously, it\u2019s predominantly euro-denominated. Two-thirds of its business is in France. A third of its business is outside. Some of that business outside also has a euro linkage. But there is a significant proportion maybe a quarter that is non-euro- denominated and actually may even benefit from improvements in the dollar position. So there is a degree of offset and complexity even within the numbers. It\u2019s not just a straight euro thing.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. If you decide to buy Gras Savoye, what currency do you pay for it, is that euros?", "Dominic Casserley", "Yes. The transaction is denominated in euros.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. Are there any hedging -- is it too early to consider hedging, given how strong the dollar has been relative to the euro recently?", "Dominic Casserley", "So Meyer we actually looked at that. And at this point, we don\u2019t have a decision from the Board. The management team is going to come through and make a recommendation. The Board has in terms of preliminary discussions been supportive. The final outcome will depend on due diligence.", "In terms of from that decision point through to the end of the year, when we look at the forward rates, the euro interest rates are going to be low for sometime based on those curves. We looked at locking in rates and actually we found that to lock them in at this point it would be uneconomical based on our projections of interest rates. But we are going to continue to evaluate that shortly after we have the decision from the Board.", "John Greene", "Now I would remind you that the present structure is for us not to close that transaction until the summer of 2016. So we are looking quite far out at this point in terms of the hedge we have to do.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And one more question if I can. I am not sure I understood whether the expectation for mid-single-digit organic growth, does that apply over the course of the year to all four of the new segments?", "Dominic Casserley", "No, as I have said, pretty clearly I think number of times we see the combination of our portfolio delivering that growth. You saw in the fourth quarter how quite we\u2019re uneven, but we delivered mid-single digit. And we think during the course of the year, the portfolio will continue to perform strongly in that mid-single-digit range quarter-to-quarter, some will be up more than others. Often, as you know, the comparison can be simply relating to a particularly strong or a particularly less strong quarter. It can affect the percentage downturn. So again, I would have you focus on the portfolio and how it\u2019s going to perform.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. Understood. Thanks so much.", "Dominic Casserley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair.", "Adam Klauber", "Thanks. Good morning. A question on cash. Look like you used roughly $770 million of cash. When I look at your release, I think you generated cash -- I lost my number -- generated cash around $460 million, you ran down cash by another $160 million, so there is like a $100 million, $120 million gap of where cash came from, where did that extra cash come from?", "Dominic Casserley", "So you are right, we have been continuing to work hard on our cash management activities and we will continue to do so. And the combination of those various things has enabled us to continue to drive our management of cash. John, do you want to talk about that?", "John Greene", "So there is cash from earnings. Certainly, we also had sales of slow growth offices in North America which I think cash impact there was $70 million, $80 million positive.", "Adam Klauber", "Okay.", "John Greene", "We had the settlement that we talked about for another $12 million and there is a big chunky items then the rest is still working capital. We\u2019ve had a pretty consistent effort to try to do two things on the working capital piece. One was extend payable days. We\u2019ve done that. That will turn into about $20 million cash in terms of bringing it forward. And then on the receivables, we\u2019ve just began starting work on that to ensuring that conversion cycle from essentially billing to remittance and we are hopeful that that will enhance the cash position in 2015.", "Adam Klauber", "Okay. So as we think about 2015, right now you have $635 million of cash. Can that balance come down somewhat again and\u2026?", "Dominic Casserley", "Yes. Yeah. So the way, we think about it right now is that in terms of the cash that we need for working capital purposes, as well as from a regulatory standpoint and particular geographies is between $400 million and $300 million.", "Adam Klauber", "Okay.", "John Greene", "So that means there is -- call it, $300 million of cash available for investing opportunities.", "Dominic Casserley", "So that\u2019s why we are very comfortable in thinking through our ability to absorb the Miller payments and continue to do the share repurchases during 2015, with some call maybe upon our revolver but not having to issue more debt. So that\u2019s how we are comfortable with that.", "Adam Klauber", "Okay. That makes sense. And then one question on Miller. Very good organization, so you have a very good deal. Will that be the majority? I think you mentioned $55 million of potential additional EBITDA. Will that be a majority coming -- is it coming from Miller?", "Dominic Casserley", "It obviously depends when we close, exactly how much it will come from Miller. But the combination or integration of Charles Monat, Max Matthiessen, some smaller deals, I think we\u2019ll continue to be the majority in 2015.", "Adam Klauber", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Dominic Casserley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question is from Mark Hughes of SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "Yeah. Thank you. When you look for the faster growth in revenues than expenses, should we start on a base if we are doing some modeling at the 18% organic operating margin or the 17% reported operating margin?", "Dominic Casserley", "It depends on what you want to model, I think. So, let me tell you how we think about just to help you to think about it. Obviously, why we\u2019ve given you more transparency this time around is to make sure you see more clearly how our organic business is performing and be very much. When we are doing our additional planning, we look at our organic business for the coming year and how we see that performing. Okay. So we are interested obviously in how we see that market, then we lay on top of that acquisitions and how we see that they impact.", "And then we think through what\u2019s the impact of the operational improvement program in here because as we\u2019ve said to you, when the impact of the operational improvement program actually hits the numbers, depends on frankly timing of when the project gets finished, when people actually move and when the people actually leave the organizations. So we think through those components.", "And so we have an organic view of the firm and then we have if you like, an underlying view of the firm, which will explain those things. And that\u2019s how we model it and we are obviously interested in driving EBITDA coming out all of it in ways of looking at the company and the margin in both of them.", "Mark Hughes", "Right. So, when you provided the guidance your thought was the base for 2014 was the organic performance of the business rather than the reported, which was about as I said, about a 100 basis point lower?", "Dominic Casserley", "Yes. So the -- when we said that revenues will grow faster than expense growth by 130 basis points that is -- we said that\u2019s organic revenues and the impact of organic transactions and the impact of the operational improvement program in 2015.", "Mark Hughes", "Right. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "All right. There are no other questions at this time.", "Dominic Casserley", "Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody. We look forward to talking to you again at the end of our first quarter. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. This completes today's conference.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.", "I would turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Peter Poillon. Sir, you may begin.", "Peter Poillon", "Thank you, and welcome to our First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call, which is being hosted by Dominic Casserley, Chief Executive Officer of Willis Group Holdings. A webcast replay of the call, along with the slide presentation to which we will be referring, can be accessed through our website.

Copies may be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Also, please note that certain financial measures that we use on the call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release and slides associated with this call.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dominic.", "Dominic Casserley", "Welcome and thank you for joining our quarterly conference call. With me today are John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer; Steve Hearn, our Deputy CEO; Tim Wright, Head of Willis International; and Todd Jones, Head of Willis North America. I\u2019m delighted also to welcome Nicolas Aubert, CEO of Willis GB to his first earnings call.", "As I did last quarter, I want to start with an overview of the key components of our value creation strategy. I am pleased to say that our first quarter results once again saw all three pillars of our strategy in action.", "First, we aimed to drive organic profit and cash flow growth through our diversified portfolio of risk advisory, brokerage and human capital and benefits businesses. We\u2019ve got growth coming from across the group. We are focused on delivering mid single digit organic revenue growth. In parallel, we seek to manage our organic cost to create a healthy gain in organic margin.", "Group organic revenue growth of 3.4% was satisfactory, given uneven conditions across the markets in which we operate. We saw underlying growth across all of our segments, with solid growth reported in many of our businesses. I will discuss this in detail in a moment.", "This quarter\u2019s results revealed great progress on our margin, as we achieved 170 basis points of positive spread between our organic commissions and fees growth and our organic expense growth. This positions us well to achieve our stated goal of at least 130 basis points of average spread for the year.", "The second leg of our strategy is managing our targeted acquisitions to create value through stronger revenue performance and improved cash flow. During the quarter, our M&A strategy continued to make substantial contributions to our underlying growth. As we look ahead, we remain optimistic that we can sustain growth through our announced acquisitions.", "We expect to close the Miller transaction in the middle of the year, subject to regulatory approvals. And just last week, we announced that we have made a firm offer to acquire the remaining 70% of Gras Savoye that we do not already own. We are extremely excited of the prospects of joining forces with both of these organizations. I will come back to discuss the Gras Savoye transaction at the end of our prepared remarks.", "Third, we continue to transform our financial performance with our operational improvement program. This major initiative announced on this call a year ago is designed to deliver sustainable annual cost savings of $300 million beginning in 2018 with a gradual process of cost improvement each year up until then. We will reinvest a minority of the savings generated, but expect that the program will add to our underlying and organic performance each year as it started to do late last year and into this year.", "Since inception, the operational improvement program has delivered about $21 million in cost savings. We are making steady progress and everyone here remains optimistic that we will achieve our goals. As previously announced, we will provide a fuller update on the program during our second quarter earnings review. Combined, these three components of our strategy are intended to drive improved cash flow and shareholder value.", "Let me now turn to the quarter in more detail, starting with a discussion about Willis International. Our International operations achieved underlying commissions and fees growth in excess of 20%, an outstanding result that includes the significant impact on the segments revenues from the acquisitions of Max Matthiessen, Charles Monat and the IFG pension and benefits businesses over the past 12 months.", "On an organic basis, International had another solid quarter, growing 5.3%. International saw very strong growth from Latin America, led by Brazil. Asia grew high single digits in the quarter, led by Global Wealth Solutions and strong Marine business. Eastern Europe, which is dominated by our Russian business, grew solidly. Expected headwinds from sanctions and economic conditions did not materialize in the quarter, however, will expect to face those headwinds throughout the remainder of the year. Western Europe grew low single digits, a good result considering the overall economic conditions across that market. The Iberia region, Norway and Ireland were the primary drivers in the quarter.", "Let\u2019s now take a look at Willis North America. Last quarter you will remember that North America was down slightly, but we told you that we expected to see improved performance in the first quarter. This occurred with North America achieving organic growth of 4.7%.", "Looking at our results from a practice perspective, we saw single digit growth from our largest practice, human capital, and double-digit growth in FINEX, our second largest practice and which includes our market leading SIBA business.", "From an industry perspective, real estate and hospitality led the way with double-digit growth, while construction came in at low single digits, held back somewhat by declining surety revenues. Our mergers and acquisitions business grew solidly during the quarter. Rates during the quarter were a bit of a headwind in North America as weakening rates in the property business more than offset the slight strengthening noted in the casualty business.", "Now, onto Willis Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance, which is one of two new segments, it includes Willis Re, our Capital Markets business, our Wholesale business and a new unit called Willis Portfolio and Underwriting Services which encompasses our programs on underwriting businesses.", "Overall, this segment\u2019s organic commissions and fees were up 1.3%. The performance reflects solid results in Reinsurance, in what is the most significant quarter for revenue in our Reinsurance business. We saw declines in our Wholesale business, but relatively flat growth elsewhere compared last year.", "In Reinsurance, we continue to grow our North American business at a double-digit rate, driven by continued new business success. The business was further bolstered by favorable timing of $8 million of revenue that shifted from Q2 into Q1, a result that will have a mild impact on our growth in the second quarter. The growth in North America was offset by declines in the International and specialty reinsurance businesses, where we continued to see declining rate and consolidation driving lower demand. Willis Capital Markets delivered a good performance with a number of capital raising and advisory mandates completed.", "And finally, I\u2019d like to discuss Willis GB, our other new segment comprising our Great Britain based specialty and retail businesses. This segment is organized into four components: property and casualty, transport, financial lines and the retail network. Organic commissions and fees grew 1.1% in the quarter. This performance reflects double-digit growth in financial lines.", "We also saw mid-single digit growth in property and casualty, dominated by double-digit growth in our UK large accounts. Transport was down low single digits in the quarter, as growth in aviation was more than offset by a reduction in our marine book reflecting continued low levels of new business.", "Finally, retail networks were down driven by continued decline in a commercial network, due to the renegotiation of revenue terms with our network members and our insolvency business which is sensitive to improving economic conditions.", "So, good overall progress in the opening quarter to 2015. Now, I\u2019m going to ask John to take you through the numbers in a bit more detail. Then I\u2019ll return to talk about acquisitions. John?", "John Greene", "Thank you, Dominic. Good morning to those on the call. I'll be working on the first quarter slide deck which is available on our website.", "On slide 3, you\u2019ll see our traditional EPS line. This shows we started 2015 with a solid performance, driven by a combination of revenue growth and continued progress against our expense management goals, including those of the operational improvement programs. These two factors combined to drive organic margin expansion.", "On foreign exchange, during our last call, we indicated that if rates remained exactly where they were as of December 31, FX would pressure our EPS by between $0.03 and $0.07 for the full year of 2015. We also flagged that FX would pressure the first half of the year\u2019s results and would then ease in the second half.", "As you know, currency rates have moved since December 31. In fact, during the first quarter, the euro declined 13% versus the dollar, while the pound fell by 5%. That contributed to $0.15 negative impact on EPS in the quarter. We expect the pressure from FX movements will abate in the second half of the year, actually reversing to a degree in the third quarter. So if you assume no movements in foreign currency rates from March 31, we now expect the full year impact from FX to be a headwind of $0.10 to $0.13 per share.", "Overall, we continued the trend from last quarter. Good organic revenue growth and returns from our M&A strategy, coupled with our cost management initiatives created a $0.08 positive movement in EPS. Finally, our reported EPS includes restructuring costs related to the operational improvement program. This amounted to $31 million or $0.12 per share in the quarter. That was partially offset by the $0.01 gain from an office sale.", "Turning to slide 4, as a reminder, the difference between reported and underlying for each segment is foreign exchange movement and the difference between underlying and organic is the net impact from acquisitions and disposals. Encouragingly, excluding the foreign exchange headwinds, we had commission and fee growth on both an organic and underlying basis across each segment during the quarter.", "FX headwinds are clear when you look at the difference in reported and underlying C&F growth in Willis GB, Willis CWR and Willis International. This was driven primarily by the depreciation in the euro against the dollar, sterling and the Latin American currencies also contributed to a lesser degree.", "Two further points to note. First, International\u2019s underlying results reflect the impact of the 2014 acquisitions of Max Matthiessen, Charles Monat and the IFG business, adding about $38 million to revenue in the quarter. Second, North America\u2019s underlying results reflects revenue lost from portfolio management actions taken in 2014. In the current quarter, we sold our Omaha, Nebraska office. The result is reflected in other operating income as a $4 million gain. We\u2019ve discussed our portfolio optimization over the past few quarters and we now have largely completed those actions in North America.", "Let\u2019s turn to a walkthrough of our expenses on slide 5. Here, you can see our cost management initiatives are gaining traction as we cap our organic expense growth under 2%. Foreign currency movements favorably impacted total expenses by $48 million in the quarter. As you might expect, the biggest driver was the euro depreciation against the dollar. Underlying expenses grew by $40 million, of which $29 million related to our M&A activities.", "Included in this result were the initial costs associated with the proposed Gras Savoye acquisition amounting to about $4 million. We also saw the benefit of our operational improvement program. For the quarter, cost savings from the program totaled $10 million. We expect the quarterly savings from the program to increase especially in the second half of the year. Program cost in the quarter totaled $31 million, reflecting termination benefits, parallel running costs and professional fees. Overall, we continue to make strong progress against our goals for the program.", "Additionally, expenses in the quarter benefited from a $10 million increase in the pension expense credit. This is the result of actuarial gains and a freeze on pensionable salaries in the UK defined benefit plan implemented in March.", "Slide six takes you through salary and benefit expense. On an organic basis, S&B was up 3.3% to $544 million. This was slightly above our global inflation expectation that reflects a 1% increase in organic headcount as well as inflationary pressure in Latin America and other markets, significantly impacted by inflation or currency devaluation. We also had higher incentives in the quarter following strong performances in several businesses. Underlying S&B grew $34 million or 6.4% to $567 million. This includes a $17 million increase from M&A, roughly half the total growth in the quarter.", "Turning to slide 7, this shows our onshore and offshore FTE trends over the past 12 months on an organic basis. Our numbers reflect our continued focus on headcount management and on relocating FTEs to lower cost regions. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, the parallel running of rolls associated with the operational improvement program will mean temporary FTE growth in some quarters.", "Organic FTEs are therefore up around 1% year over year, but onshore, the number of FTEs is actually down about 300 over the same period. That means that the increase in organic FTEs is all within our low cost offshore operation in Mumbai. Over the long term, this will optimize our cost structure, while supporting our growth goals.", "On slide 8, you see our underlying EBITDA was $360 million in the first quarter, up nearly 6% year over year. The growth was broadly evenly split between organic sources and acquisitions. Overall, our underlying EBITDA performance reflects the positive impact of our acquisitions strategy and provides a mid single digit organic C&F growth and strong execution on our cost initiatives.", "A year ago in the first quarter of 2014, our underlying EBITDA grew $5 million year over year. This current quarter reflects a $20 million improvement. This illustrates the progress we are making.", "Now, let me briefly comment on our expectations for the remainder of the year. Overall, we are confident that we are well positioned to achieve our stated goals for the year. These include: mid single digit organic revenue growth, at least 130 basis point spread between organic C&F and expense growth, and approximately $55 million to $65 million of EBITDA from acquisitions, subject to the timing of Miller\u2019s closing.", "We also said the timing of the positive organic spread will be weighted to the second half of the year. That is because, as Dominic mentioned in his commentary, we are facing uneven market conditions which affect the first quarter and will also impact the second quarter and because we expect our operational improvement program savings will gather pace in the second half of the year. We will navigate these near-term headwinds and believe that we are on track to achieve our full-year target.", "Before I turn it back to Dominic, I\u2019d like to take a minute to walk you through some of the financial for the proposed acquisition of Gras Savoye on slide 9. On a US GAAP basis, Gras Savoye generated approximately \u20ac370 million of revenues in 2014 and approximately \u20ac65 million of EBITDA, producing a 17.6% margin. The two pie charts at the bottom of the slide break out Gras Savoye\u2019s revenues, first by geography and second by product lines.", "By geography, you observe a fairly even split between the three divisions of Paris, regions and international, including Africa. By product, while property and casualty is the majority of the business, you see that a sizable portion is in what we view as their high growth human capital and benefits practice. Importantly, that company continues to have strong growth prospects.", "Q1 is historically Gras Savoye\u2019s biggest quarter by revenues and in 2015 it continued to perform well, growing by strong mid single digits. We expect its underlying margin will expand in 2015 and we see excellent opportunities to drive revenue synergies post acquisition.", "From a financial perspective, we believe we\u2019ve added substantially to our capabilities at a valuation given the momentum of the business in 2015. We expect the transaction to close by December 31, subject to regulatory and worker councils reviews. If it closes at that time, we expect it to be $0.06 to $0.08 dilutive on our reported EPS in 2016, mildly dilutive in 2018 and accretive in 2018. Excluding the impact of amortization expense, we see the transaction as being accretive in the range of $0.13 to $0.17 per share in 2016.", "Now, I will turn the call back to Dominic to cover the strategic aspects of the transaction and wrap up the call.", "Dominic Casserley", "Thank you, John. As I discussed before, strategic acquisitions are a key aspect of our growth strategy and we continue to make progress, having both high-quality businesses in 2014 to further strengthen our client proposition and our growth prospects. We have continued our progress on this strategy with the announcement of the proposed Miller and Gras Savoye transactions. Today, I\u2019d like to talk more about Gras Savoye and what it means for Willis.", "Take a look at slide 10. First, the remainder of some of what Gras Savoye would bring to the combined firm. A strong footprint in France, where it is the largest broker and where it holds a strong market share in French large accounts and enjoys a leading position in the midmarket sector. The expertise and reach to serve multinationals including in France which is home to 31 of the Fortune Global 500, a number that ranks it fourth globally and first in Europe; access to high-growth economies and insurance markets, including Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and a comprehensive network of 42 offices in 31 countries across Africa; strong property and casualty product capabilities and employee benefit products.", "In the graph, you see that our network of wholly owned country operations in a combined Willis Gras Savoye would double in size from 42 pre-acquisition to 84. We believe this transaction would give us one of the largest wholly owned country networks in our industry, further enhancing Willis\u2019 ability to serve the needs of the multinational corporations around the world.", "Let me conclude with these points on the transaction and our strategy has a whole. This union would be the next step in a long standing relationship that has spanned decades. Over the decade, we have worked closely many times as a joint force to win business. We have strong ties and let relationships with the management team and many of the terrific Gras Savoye employees around the world. It is our belief that combining the entities into one fully integrated company will allow us to continue to add value to client offerings, provide great opportunities for employees of both firms and then help us to build shareholder value into the future.", "Finally, let me return to where we started, our strategy. As I said, you see all three pillars of our strategy in action in this quarter\u2019s results: organic growth through our diversified portfolio, strategic M&A, and operational improvement. It is this deliberate and determined approach that is enabling us to sustain good momentum overall in an external context of uneven economic performance and a challenging rate environment.", "Going forward, we remain confident in our prospects and believe we are well positioned to achieve our stated goals for the year. The three elements of our strategy come together to drive growth in earnings, improve our margins and increase cash flow, with the overall aspiration to bring value to our shareholders.", "And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to question-and-answers. Over to the operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Cliff Gallant from Nomura.", "Cliff Gallant", "Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the 170 basis points spread you achieved this quarter between organic revenues and expenses. Were there any one time items that might have been driving that, because I notice in your comments that you said that you were beginning to see the operational improvements come into effect?", "John Greene", "Actually looking at the balance of what happened, so we certainly performed well on the top line. So the organic growth coming in at 3.4% supplemented by the acquisition certainly helped. We did have a movement as Dominic mentioned in his commentary of a particular reinsurance contract that historically is booked in the second quarter, booked in the first quarter.", "We actually had more, on the expense side we had more pressure from the Gras Savoye due diligent cost that I mentioned of $4 million, we also had about $3 million of cost related to Miller that came through. We expect little bit more to come through when the transaction closes. So no significant one-offs, there is a little bit of timing and we\u2019re in a pretty good position I think.", "Cliff Gallant", "Given that performance in this first quarter, just wanted to confirm your statements that you still feel that the second half will be stronger than the first half?", "John Greene", "Yes. We thought about those statements carefully. Obviously we gave annual guidance as part of the fourth quarter earnings call, we\u2019re going to stick with that earnings guidance and we\u2019re going to manage to it. And if the top line continues and our expense base continues to be managed as we have, we see that we\u2019re going to deliver the 130 basis points and possibly a little bit of upside on that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.", "Kai Pan", "The first question, just want to clarify, John, your comments on the full year impact foreign exchange, you said if the currency stay the same as the quarter end, the foreign currency impact for the full year will be $0.10 to $0.13, is that inclusive of $0.15 negative impact which imply the remaining of the year you would have the benefit from it, or just second quarter to the fourth quarter of this year?", "John Greene", "As we talked, $0.15 negative impact on the first quarter, the range I gave was a full year impact, so we see if the rates remain exactly where there were as of March 31, I want to emphasize that point because we do know that rates have moved in April a little bit, actually the euro strengthened marginally, but if they were to remain exactly where they were as of March 31, we would see that a range of $0.10 to $0.13 for the full year.", "Kai Pan", "Then the second question is on the...", "John Greene", "The improvement happens in the third quarter. We see a pick up in the third quarter just based on the flow of the revenues coming through.", "Kai Pan", "So it\u2019d be a positive impact, actually improvements in the third quarter?", "John Greene", "Yes.", "Kai Pan", "Second question on acquisition impact on the margin, you showed pretty strong organic margin improvement, 120 basis points, but if you look at underlying margin improvement is only like 10, 20 basis points. So I guess the difference between those two numbers are from some drag from the acquisition or dispositions, could you talk a little bit more about that and what\u2019s potential drag if any from the acquisition going forward, like Miller and Gras Savoye?", "Dominic Casserley", "Yes. So the organic obviously strips out the acquisitions, so 12 months of acquisition revenue and expenses and operating income. The difference between organic and underlying therefore is the acquisitions and what we ended up buying are companies with margins that are slightly lower than what Willis has posted and that results in a lower margin, but we also paid a valuation when we bought those companies that reflected the margin rates that the company has had.", "And obviously we\u2019re managing them and we expect to drive some synergies over the longer term, but it\u2019s not going to happen immediately. So that does impact. There is also the impact of amortization that comes through, so the difference between the net assets and the purchase price that comes through and that impacts the underlying numbers.", "Steve Hearn", "I\u2019d like to step in here and add to this, remember, we are very focused on growing our cash flow and EBITDA and so when we are buying businesses what we\u2019re really focused on is their impact on our cash flow over time and growing our cash flow, which is a combination of the value of those franchises and the profits they are moving today and our ability to improve those over time.", "And what we are already seeing is that the businesses we have bought continue to perform well in their part of the Willis family and we see significant revenue and cost synergies over time from many of them. So we already focused on the medium term, in fact immediate and medium-term impact on the cash flow generation. And so far everything is very positive.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse.", "Ryan Tunis", "I think my first question is for John and it\u2019s actually on the pension side, on the UK pension, I know the vast majority of pension contributions are coming from the UK and I think the 10-K indicated you are currently negotiating a new funding arrangement with the plan\u2019s trustees. And I think at least on a US GAAP basis that plan looks overfunded, I guess I\u2019m just curious where are we in those negotiations, could they have any real impact on cash flow going forward or potentially could they bring down that profit share above $900 million of EBITDA that you guys pointed to in the K?", "John Greene", "So we are having ongoing conversations with the trustees, so I really can\u2019t get into much detail in terms of the funding arrangement. The key impact for the quarter, however, was freezing the pension, so basically the impact of that is participants\u2019 salary increases aren\u2019t reflected in the defined benefit calculation going forward on their retirement or exit from the company.", "And if you take a look at the balance sheet on page 12 of the press release, it shows that the pension benefit has actually moved materially, almost $300 million, and that related to frankly the valuation as a result of freezing it. So there will be some income benefit for Willis over the next seven, eight years in terms of amortization of expense or cost of the pension.", "The actuarial deficit also changed materially as a result freezing those pension benefits. So we think that we are in a fairly good position in terms of where we are from an accounting and a business perspective. It\u2019s really important that we treat our people fairly and create a fair outcome for our people in terms of ensuring the pension is funded appropriately. But there are those contingencies associated with the funding arrangements that were implemented about three years ago that we are looking to mitigate over time. But we will see how the conversations go with the trustees.", "Ryan Tunis", "And then switching back over to Gras real quick, on the guidance you guys gave us last week and just reiterated this morning, I guess, what are you guys assuming in terms of revenue growth or margin expansion there, I think you said you think you can grow margins in the 50, what\u2019s going into that guidance?", "Dominic Casserley", "Let me turn that over to Tim Wright who has been leading our discussions with Gras Savoye and led to the announcement last week. Tim?", "Tim Wright", "Couple of things. You asked about the momentum of the business in 2015 and then also what we see as future growth opportunities over time. I think as we said earlier, 2015 Gras Savoye will not be part of the Group according to the plan, they will become part of the Group beginning of 2016.", "We see positive momentum in both top line and bottom line and margin in Gras Savoye in 2015 as evidenced by very strong first quarter, which as you know is the largest quarter by far of Gras Savoye, it gets about 40% of the revenues of Gras Savoye come in the first quarter. So they have really positive momentum in the first quarter 2015.", "In terms of revenue opportunities over time, given the complementary nature of our two businesses, we\u2019re now where we\u2019re not and the combination creates the opportunity for us to grow jointly as a result. We see substantial revenue opportunities over time once they\u2019re part of the Group, bringing our collective capabilities to bet and combining our footprint.", "In terms of precise numbers, we\u2019re working with through our plans with respect to what that would mean financially, so it\u2019s too early to say. They won\u2019t be part of the Group until the end of the year, but we think there is significant incremental growth opportunity from the combination.", "Ryan Tunis", "And then I just had one more quick one for John, just in terms of how to think about the funding for this deal, I think in the slide you said likely funded with debt, I mean if you could just help us with that thought maybe in the last quarter you were hoping it would mainly be cash and a letter of credit, I don\u2019t know if there is a change there, just how are you thinking about funding mix, rating agency considerations, et cetera?", "John Greene", "So rates are actually at a fantastic level to fund a transaction like this. We are exploring options. The one option that is probably predominant at this time is a euro bond, probably sometime in the fourth quarter and the order of magnitude could be somewhere between $500 million and $600 million. We\u2019re going to continue to explore other options, we have the RCF with $800 million capability there, we haven\u2019t touched it. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good way to fund a long-term transaction. So we will look at our cash position when we get closer to closing and make a call. But as I said, I think it will be something between $500 million and $600 million and where it stands right now, if rates remain where they are, it might be a euro bond.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust.", "Mark Hughes", "The organic growth target or spread of 130 basis points, have you calculated on an underlying basis given the profile of the acquisitions, what does that translate into for the spread growth there, again on the underlying business?", "John Greene", "We gave guidance on an organic basis and I\u2019m a little bit hesitant right now to provide some additional enhanced guidance on an underlying basis, given we\u2019re going to have some transaction costs coming through and the impact of amortization on these transactions. So 130 basis points organic is pretty good, you know the pipeline in terms of the two significant transactions that we got to close. So I would say user data we provided and it should give you a pretty good indication on the underlying numbers.", "And I think what\u2019s positive about where our underlying spread will move, but obviously the timing of when Miller closes and the big thing there, of course, is the accelerated amortization which affects heavily the short-term underlying spread you see, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re hesitant to give that. We\u2019ve given clear guidance on what we think we can do organically than the timing around some of the closing that some of these transactions is going to have an effect on how the amortization goes through.", "Mark Hughes", "And then you talked about the positive impact of increasing the pension, the $10 million increase in pension benefit credit, was that part of that benefit, you saw some of that this quarter, is that right?", "John Greene", "We did, yes.", "Mark Hughes", "And then the volatility in the US, you had a very nice improvement this quarter. It seems like that\u2019s been pretty mobile, a lot of movement in those numbers. You think that will stabilize, were those some unique circumstances the last few quarters, should we expect more consistency perhaps in North America?", "Dominic Casserley", "Let me turn over to Todd Jones just to give you a sense of what\u2019s going on in the States. Todd?", "Todd Jones", "I think as we had talked about last quarter, we had some unique circumstances that we thought weren\u2019t going to repeat the impact of the quarter and then obviously we saw the business return to what we consider sort of more normal performance this quarter. As we looked through the balance of the year, and I think we mentioned the rating environment continues to be a headwind having just returned from wins, I don\u2019t think anything I\u2019ve heard there would suggest that that rating environment is going to improve anytime in the near term.", "But we are still very optimistic about the growth prospects of the business. Certainly, the industry strategy, we are very happy that construction came back to growth and our human capital and benefits business performed well in the quarter as well. So still bullish on the full year, we got a lot of challenges from a rating environment, but I think we can continue to grow sustainably.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS.", "Brian Meredith", "A couple of quick questions here for you. First, just on the tax rate 22 and change in the quarter, is that a good go forward rate or is it a little bit low given mix of revenues and earnings in the quarter?", "John Greene", "I think it\u2019s lower than the guidance we gave, during the Q&A in the December call, related to December results, I mentioned something around 25%. And in the quarter, we benefited from the mix of revenue as well as the strengthening of provision on our balance sheet that we are able to release. So I would think in terms of a range, 25% and obviously it\u2019s an important piece of the income statement and we continue to look at.", "Brian Meredith", "And then just a clarification, the $10 million pension benefit, that was all in this quarter and that\u2019s heavily impacted the other operating expenses and is there any \u2013 and what is the GAAP impact we\u2019ll see here going forward from the freeze in the pension benefit earnings going forward?", "John Greene", "The benefit is reflected in S&B, so it\u2019s part of employee benefits. And the $10 million is a year over year change and some of that, as I said in my prepared script, related to frankly the actuarial view of our interest income our earnings from the pension and the other piece had to do with the freeze. So we can expect for the year, this first quarter here, is better than the \u2013 $10 million better. Going forward, the way we are looking at, it\u2019s likely to repeat.", "Brian Meredith", "So we should continue to see a $10 million benefit for the next several quarters?", "John Greene", "Thereabouts. It could be slightly more, it could be slightly less.", "Brian Meredith", "Just on the revenue side, in the wholesale businesses, I know the energy markets have been pretty weak, Gulf of Mexico energy, would that impact the second quarter, when does that likely to impact results and should we expect some pressure on organic revenue growth in that area as a result in the second quarter?", "Dominic Casserley", "Let me start having Steve Hearn talk about that any may Nicolas might want to add. But let me have Steve start talking about the energy outlook.", "Steve Hearn", "Energy is obviously something significant to Willis around the world, with our Russian business earlier has impact there, it certainly has impact in our London business in Nicolas\u2019 area and in Todd\u2019s business for that matter. So what\u2019s going on in the energy market is something we clearly follow very closely.", "One of the things, the way I think about this is this doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate volatility in the energy market in terms of our earnings. And if fact, if we go back to previous energy crisis, the actual impact on our earnings was relatively negligible, modest impact. It takes a long time for construction projects to actually start and get more full, construction continues to develop in the energy sector.", "At the moment, we see \u2013 and then obviously there is operational risk which continues to be active. So we are watching it closely, don\u2019t see anything particularly spiky and I think certainly at the moment all of those businesses that I\u2019ve mentioned are continuing to perform well in the energy area. That is more than anyone else would like.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.", "Josh Shanker", "I just want to talk about the growth rates a little bit on the different segments, it was mentioned that you had the negative 2% in North America followed by plus 4%, last quarter you had a plus 15% international, now you have plus 5% and then you had the 2Q transactions and the 1Q transaction, in 1Q in wholesales and capital and reinsurance, and you also mentioned the impact of sanctions going forward for international. I\u2019m wondering if you can take the 1Q growth rate numbers and sort of give us a little bit of thoughts on what might be a normalized version and whether you\u2019d take the 1Q growth rate for the individual segment as close to normalized?", "Dominic Casserley", "First of all, let me make the following overall point. We are deliberately building a diversified specialty businesses, across where we complete, so we\u2019re deepening our markets geographically and in our product lines, we have specialists who have leading market franchises. And we therefore have a diversified portfolio of businesses, which at any one time [indiscernible] which give us confidence about the overall growth rate we\u2019re going to achieve from the Group. Because we are diverse, we have strength and diversification. Now, with that as a background, let\u2019s focus first on international, because we did have that very large fourth quarter last year. And have Tim just talk to us about the international story. Tim?", "Tim Wright", "First of all on the fourth quarter, 15% growth, we were very pleased with that, but we did cool out that it benefited from some year-on-year comparables and that actually if you excluded that it was probably more like 11% which we were still very pleased with. And the full year number was more like 9% overall for the last year and then again if you still step back to fourth quarter comparables, probably 7%, 7.5%. That gives you an indication of what the last year was.", "Q1 results at over 5% is in line with what we\u2019ve seen in the past for the first quarter and we\u2019re confident that puts us in a good place for the rest of the year. On Russia, which you called out, obviously we have a fabulous business in Russia, a great market position and benefited from that in the past and talked to that about in the past.", "Clearly, the combination of sanctions which have restricted the capital market and hence project business which is a large part of our portfolio is a pressure. And the decline of the ruble impacting the FX impact, does impact asset values. We actually had a good first quarter in Russia, but we do expect some pressure from that to come over the remainder of the year, but we still feel positive about the overall results of international of the full year.", "Sorry, go ahead again?", "Josh Shanker", "Can Russia move you by 100 basis points one way or the other in that segment?", "Tim Wright", "As Dominic said, in the same way the group has the benefit of a portfolio effect, so does the international business. So in any given year, we\u2019ll have some businesses that are performing very strongly and others that are a bit more challenged and the portfolio effect helps us to average those out.", "Dominic Casserley", "And Josh clearly another point on that side, for 2016, the portfolio effect will be even stronger with the addition of Miller and the addition of Gras Savoye. So we\u2019re again adding specialist capabilities in those markets in Miller for a specialized position in the wholesale markets in London, but further diversifying our exposure to any one particular market. Now, where else would you like us to go, I think we\u2019ve covered the United States.", "Josh Shanker", "The reinsurance transactions that you did in this quarter that was normally booked in 2Q, I assume that had some impact or might be a slight drag on 2Q?", "Dominic Casserley", "I think we said that, this is a reinsurance booking. Steve, do you want to talk a bit more on that?", "Josh Shanker", "Do you have a number around that?", "Steve Hearn", "So as John mentioned in his prepared script, that\u2019s an $8 million number for us, short timing, something that historically had always turned up in Q2 turned up in Q1, so be benefited from it and it will absolutely have an impact on Q2 for that segment for sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dan Farrell from Piper Jaffray.", "Dan Farrell", "With some of the upcoming M&A, I was wondering if you could just remind us of what your tolerances are in terms of increases to debt leverage and maybe you could just relate it to either a net debt to EBITDA on interest coverage, how do you think about where you can go on those measures.", "Dominic Casserley", "Let me start and then I am going to hand it over to John. Our overall view is on acquisitions overall, let me remind you, is that we\u2019re focused on specialized franchises either geographically or by line of business. And secondly, very, very importantly, institutions and people because what we are really buying is people here and their talent, who really want to become part of Willis and that requires long-term conversations, not always as long as decades, we\u2019ve been in conversations with Gras Savoye, but certainly for a long period of time and largely leads us away from optioned situations, but instead exclusive conversations. So that\u2019s our philosophy.", "Once we have those assets, we then look out very carefully at our financial capability and flexibility. You\u2019ve heard John talk about driving things from cash and cash flow, and then debt either revolver which we tend not to think of as the appropriate source for long-term funding, and in the long term markets which at the moment are at an interesting set of levels. And then of course, in that context, we don\u2019t worry about our overall credit rating and a position with our creditors and the financial markets. And we broadly been operating within the context of remaining investment grade. That\u2019s our broad philosophy.", "Now, let me hand over to John to give a bit more detail on that.", "John Greene", "The specifics around covenants, there is plenty of room on the covenant, so we were \u2013 from a debt to EBITDA standpoint, we\u2019re at 2.6 as of the end of the year. If we were to fund the Gras Savoye transaction with debt, that could go up to 2.9 and we see a horizon where it drops back down to 2.6 in a relatively short amount of time. So within 24 to 30 months. So we\u2019re comfortable with that. Our bank covenants are 3.2, between 3.25 and 3.5, depending on the particular nature of what\u2019s driving that EBITDA and debt. So we\u2019re well within threshold and we continue to manage it as Dominic mentioned.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Mr. Adam Klauber from William Blair.", "Adam Klauber", "I\u2019m not sure if you said, will Miller be accretive next year?", "John Greene", "We covered that on the previous call, so from a cash EPS, it definitely will be and I think for next year we said, I don\u2019t have the details in front of me, but I think we said it was about neutral or slightly up on an underlying basis. So strongly positive from a cash EPS basis and basically flat from an underlying basis, which includes the amortization.", "Adam Klauber", "It should be margin accretive on an EBITDA or cash basis do you think?", "John Greene", "Flattish I think broadly.", "Adam Klauber", "And then one follow-up on the difference between underlying operating margin and organic, as we think about modeling off that base, should we think about modeling, so first quarter this year the underlying margin was 29.8% whereas organic operating margin was 30.7%, what is the starting point, is it 29.8% or the 30.7%?", "John Greene", "Could you just repeat that question so we are absolutely clear, when you say starting point, starting point for what?", "Adam Klauber", "So when we\u2019re modeling for next year, so we\u2019re thinking about will the margin increase from first quarter 2015 to the first quarter 2016, should our starting point 29.8% or the 30.7%?", "John Greene", "Let me start by saying, the one piece of guidance we have given you and the only piece of guidance we have given you on margin is related to our organic margin, what\u2019s going to happen to difference between our organic revenues and organic expenditures, right. And that we have said will \u2013 there will be a 130 basis points or more spread between those two numbers in 2015. As I think we tried to answer an earlier question, translating that precisely into what happens to the underlying margin, well of course it would be supportive of the underlying margin significantly.", "The timing of acquisitions of when they come in and when the amortization starts to flow through and exactly how we fund those acquisitions short-term versus long-term, therefore that the debt cost will be makes it a little harder to translate that immediately into what the underlying increase in margin will be in 2015 because of that reason. That\u2019s why when we gave you guidance on what would happen to spread between revenues and cost, we focused you on organic because of all the complications which just flow through in timing issues et cetera on underlying.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mr. Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Two questions. First is on cash flow which despite some pretty good EBITDA trends, the first quarter was negative $64 million from operations versus plus $5 million, timing was impacted that?", "Dominic Casserley", "John, why don\u2019t you talk about the cash flow factor.", "John Greene", "I will. So when we look at where we were 2014 to 2015, so the difference was a deterioration of about $69 million and there were largely four components driving that. So there was the cash impact of the operational improvement program that was about $20 million. There were year over year increased contributions to the defined benefit plan of $16 million. There were translation impact from operating income from the FX coming through which amounted to about $20 million. And then the change in the balance sheet was about $10 million. So that explains the operating cash flow year over year.", "In terms of the movements from December 31 to March 31, the first quarter is a big quarter with incentive payments. So we accrue as the year goes on, but actually the cash that goes out the door, majority of it happens in the first quarter and that\u2019s really the driver of that decrease in cash when you look at 12/31 to March 31.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "And if I could just, one follow-up on Gras Savoye, recognizing that my math maybe off because you don\u2019t give us enough details to get this fully, it looks like you\u2019re paying EBITDA of about 12 times and a PE of about 20 times, accepting earnings EPS dilution for cash flow positives, Gras Savoye looks like your equity of affiliates sort of declined for the quarter, I assume currency is the explanation between Gras Savoye had a good first quarter versus reporting a down in total for affiliates, but the question is there\u2019s not much organic growth visible in earnings for Gras Savoye and you\u2019re paying them a very high valuation from a EPS perspective. Are we going to talk in terms of cash earnings instead of EPS going forward given the dislocation of the two?", "Dominic Casserley", "So let me start and then I\u2019m going to hand over to Tim and then I\u2019m probably going to end up with John. So let me start with a generic point. We have been watching with some interest some of the commentary around the price we are paying for Gras Savoye. Obviously we are paying at the end of 2015 for this transaction.", "We would have thought the normal thing for people to do would be to be looking at either trailing 12 months which would be 2015 or even forward looking performance of the business. Occasionally we\u2019ve seen people taking the 2014 number and translate into, which strikes me as a bit odd. So we do not believe we are paying 12 times EBITDA for this business. Let me be very clear on that. And our calculations are nowhere near that sort of number.", "But in terms of the performance of the business and how it\u2019s performing and outlook, let me hand over to Tim and then hand over to John to talk about cash EPS, how we\u2019re thinking about that? So Tim?", "Tim Wright", "So first thing to say, the way in which we calculated the price was broadly in line with the formula in our existing shareholder agreement, which is a document of public record that that is a formula that\u2019s based on a combination of revenue and EBITDA for 2014 and 2015. Obviously by accelerating in making a [indiscernible] we have taken a view on 2015 based on the experience at the beginning of the year and our best estimates for the remainder of the year.", "Into that calculation and into your thinking, you should factor the fact that 2015 looks very good as I said earlier in full respects, so we saw an improvement in 2014 in terms of revenue growth and margin expansion and we see more of that from the experience of the first quarter which is the largest.", "And then in terms of the associated line, you\u2019re absolutely right, the associated line is predominantly Gras Savoye and that was lower than you would expect, given that forward momentum due to FX and the other, the performance of our other associates which was principally around timing. So you shouldn't join the dots on the associated line and 2015 performance to conclude that the performance is down and that's what we've made.", "John Greene", "On the associated line, there was about $3 million of FX that hit that, so you strip that out and on an underlying basis, you are up about 8% there. So good performance in the quarter. In terms of cash EPS and how we're thinking about the business, looking at the past 12 months in terms of some of the things we did in terms of breaking out underlying and organic and reported in trying to create some symmetry there and consistency.", "The idea of adding a new metric in this year I thought would create frankly some confusion in the marketplace and given the timing of the transaction and some noncash items that are likely to happen, as we mentioned the valuation reserve could be reversed at some point in the second half of the year. My feeling was cash EPS is definitely the right way to go, but not likely in 2015, certainly for 2016, with seem to make a lot of sense with the Gras Savoye transaction and Miller committed.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mr. Thomas Mitchell from Miller Tabak.", "Thomas Mitchell", "I just wanted to look at the restructuring cost and you may have gone over this before in concept, but I just wanted to double check it, as we model, since we are looking at a period that has roughly 4 years to run, maybe a little bit less, for the operating improvement program and then it would seem to me that if you have a planned process for the restructuring cost, you might be able to give us an idea of what that would look like quarter by quarter, some sort of guidance on how that would look, maybe the $31 million from this quarter is much higher than what it will be in the first quarter of 2018, but it might be helpful in between to have some sort of indication of how that's expected to go?", "John Greene", "As I think we said we are going to give you a pretty full update on how we see the operational improvement program progressing and how we see it flowing through our financials in our second quarter earnings update in July where we will address many of these issues.", "Frankly, not to press that conversation, but getting into quarter by quarter exactly how the restructuring expenses will flow as we look out into 2016 and 2017 is a little difficult to do. I think we can do it at an annual level, but the details of exactly when the particular level are running and other cost will actually fall when we start looking out, it gets a little hard to be that precise looking two years ahead. But bear with us and we will give you a full update of where we are and how we see this flowing through our financials in July.", "Thomas Mitchell", "Now my second question is just I think I understand it, but I just wanted to double check. Essentially what you are giving us with organic is same-store, it's the equivalent of same-store results, which means that an acquisition once it's actually been in the fold for 15 months becomes part of the same-store base and the disposition obviously is moved out of the same-store base, so that when we are looking at organic numbers in the future we don't really have to worry about what is the right number for the percentage, for instance your percentage, once you have had an acquisition for over a year, your percentage changes in operating profit margin are going to be tied to what the same-store base was, i.e., including Gras Savoye, sometime let say in 2017 and so on. Do I have that right?", "Dominic Casserley", "You broadly do. I think the same store analogy is not a bad one. Let me hand over to John to make sure the precision of what we're doing out there is clear to you.", "John Greene", "You're probably right. It is same-store concept, but the one nuance to the definition would be 12 months after an acquisition is closed or disposal, 12 months of activity from that acquisition out of organic, so that we can get a pure view for the 12 months. After 12 months, it becomes part of organic and logically that makes sense because you activate your integration activities and it really becomes embedded within your operations.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Cohen", "You may have addressed this with some of your earlier comments, but you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Dominic, facing uneven markets, I think that was the term you used, in the first half and those should get better in the second half. I wasn't quite sure what you were referring to?", "Dominic Casserley", "I was just referring to the conditions, I think Jay, that you're very, very familiar with, which is everyone knows that the reinsurance markets are interesting with consolidation of the large ends and pricing pressure around particularly Florida cat, the access of alternative capital. I think Todd talked about the fact that we've seen flattish rate slightly down, something is up in North America and something is slightly down, some markets we see, aviation rates continue to be challenging et cetera, so we're seeing that.", "I don't think I necessarily said that they are going to go away in the second half of the year. I don't think we are saying that at all. We continue to believe and I think I said many, many times on calls that we never budget or operate on the basis that we will be in a hard market. We believe that what's going on in our markets, yes, there are ups and downs, but across our diversified portfolio that would be a mistake to budget or act on that basis. But we are seeing particular some of our segments, we are seeing some of that rate pressure and you'll start seeing that in some of the relative growth rates between some of our segments.", "On the other hand, we benefit from some markets which are stronger and growing. E.g., we continue to see good growth in our human benefits practice, in some of our international markets we are continuing to see good growth in our market share and in some pricing. So that's what I meant. But I think I was trying to particularly signal that some of our segments during the course of the year are facing a year-on-year pricing differential, which you are seeing in our results. But again, our diversified portfolio of specialty businesses gives us the ongoing ability to deliver single digit organic revenue growth.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Meyer Shields from KBW.", "Meyer Shields", "Just two quick questions, if I can. One, I think this is for John, the $10 million savings on the pension, assuming that's a rough quarterly run rate, was that contemplated in the 130 basis point revenue expense spread?", "John Greene", "Yes, about half of it. We hadn\u2019t froze the pension, the UK pension at the time, we didn\u2019t know for certain what the impact would be on that.", "Meyer Shields", "And second, and I apologize this is a little awkward, but there's been some news obviously about some defections in London to a competitor. And I don't want to get into legal aspect of it, but should we model some sort of revenue you back from that?", "John Greene", "I will answer the second part of your question. Obviously, we are somewhat constrained by the fact that we are in the middle of legal proceedings in this situation. Let me give you some general points and then answer the specific. I don't intend to get into details of the case, but let me be very clear to everyone and to you listening that we will always pursue legal against individuals and companies where we believe an awful action has compromised the interest of our clients, our staff, the carriers we work with and our shareholders. And we intend to pursue this particular case vigorously to try for the maximum recovery.", "Secondly, we are committed to investing and continually improving our offering to the fine arts and jewelry and BC clients that you were talking about and we appointed a new global CEO of that business, Seth Peller, he is enthusiastically being supported by our organization and by associated organizations and we intend to grow that business very significantly. As to the overall size of the business we are talking about, as part of the whole of Willis very small.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.", "Mike Nannizzi", "A couple of really quick ones. Just wanted to confirm, I just want to make sure I have this right, so we should be expecting a $0.02 tailwind to our earnings for the remainder of the year from FX, is that right?", "John Greene", "Yes. I would take this one, the answer is yes, likely to be in the third quarter.", "Mike Nannizzi", "And then as far as thinking about salary and benefits, just want to make sure I am thinking about this right, the $8 million timing on the reinsurance contract in North America, should we be thinking about taking that out when comparing salary and benefit growth to organic or is there some salary and benefit element in that $8 million number?", "Dominic Casserley", "I think we were referring to a revenue item, but let me have Steve clarify that.", "Steve Hearn", "That\u2019s right, Dominic. It\u2019s an $8 million revenue within a year won\u2019t impact the year, it\u2019s quarter to quarter.", "Mike Nannizzi", "I guess my point is if organic growth was 3.4% and then if we back that out then organic would be like 2.5%, 2.5% or something, versus the organic salary and benefit of 3.3%, should we be thinking about it that way and then should we expect that to flip around in the second quarter or it is not how we should be looking at it?", "John Greene", "I think the way I would look at it is I will take a look at the total year and in a particular quarter depending on the nature of the particular incentive plan and the geography could result in an increase in incentives recognized in the quarter and then there are certain triggers when businesses achieve production awards beyond a certain level that create accelerated. So the concept of trying to do this on a quarterly basis with a degree of precision especially when you don't have the level of access and obviously folks in the company, would be really hard.", "So in terms of that $8 million issue, I would look at that as a total year, it doesn't change the total year dynamics. The reason we flagged it was we wanted to make sure you had a view in terms of what was driving the first quarter and give you some insight into the second quarter.", "Dominic Casserley", "Let me just reiterate a couple of things that may have just got lost with the overlay speech there. When John was confirming the $0.02 tailwind for FX over the course of the rest of the year, that was assuming March 31 rates, which is what you said, John, but that's what the assumption is there.", "Secondly, a general point that, we do really try to get you focused on the trend in our cash flow looking on an annual basis, things move around each quarter. There are timing issues each quarter which can affect numbers, we are trying to get \u2013 we gave you guidance for the year in terms of that spread for instance, it will move around during the course of the quarter based upon the timing of particular revenues being booked, particularly expenses being booked. So that's why we're trying to focus you on the annual number.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Sticking on cash just for a second, the $0.13 to $0.17 for Gras Savoye, I am guessing that that number \u2013 that's a cash EPS number that's including the impact of debt that you might use to fund it, is that right?", "John Greene", "Yes that is correct.", "Mike Nannizzi", "Can we have the clean number from Gras Savoye then we can probably figure out what the debt piece is, but can you provide the gross number from Gras Savoye?", "Dominic Casserley", "We've given you the 2014 number, right, what the EBITDA number is for Gras Savoye in 2014 and we believe it is growing in 2015 as Tim outlined. By the time we get to the end of the year, we will have clarity on what it's grown to, but we've given you as best as we can see based upon the first quarter, it's been growing quite nicely.", "John Greene", "Just one of other point, Mike, if you do the financial statements filed in France by Gras Savoye to the regulator, you're going to see French GAAP numbers, so unless you're an expert in French GAAP to US GAAP, it will be pretty hard to do. So we tried to simplify that for you in the announcement of the transaction.", "Mike Nannizzi", "No problem. I'm sorry. I will follow up, I meant gross, S.S, not growth, I'll follow up with Peter afterwards. Thank you for that. And then just last one is still on cash, thinking about your cash coming in the door and then your cash going out the door for the next couple of years in terms of expenses and other items, do you expect that there maybe an opportunity to either reduce some of the debt that you plan to take out with Gras Savoye or return capital to shareholders in the form of reducing the share count net over the next 2 to 3 years?", "Dominic Casserley", "I think our overall capital strategy remains the same amount is to continue to, one, to invest organically where that involved CapEx, but obviously that's the systems appropriately, targeted M&A, committed to try and increase the dividend every year, which we've been doing and then finally trying to protect the share count from options exercises. We are going to take on more debt with Gras Savoye, as John said we see over the next couple of years despite that our debt to EBITDA number should come down as we grow, but we will continue to be broadly pursuing that policy of investing in the business and driving our dividend and immunizing our share count. John, do you want to add to that?", "John Greene", "The only thing I would add, Mike, is we have a fairly efficient balance sheet from an equity shareholder standpoint, given the leverage level. We are also investment grade and at this point it is certainly committed to maintaining that the rating. So what we're trying to do is in the context of low rate environment make sure we are making the best choices in terms of the capital structure of the balance sheet. So rate environment changes certainly our planning around the capital structure of the company will change. That's how I think about it.", "Operator", "We have one last question on queue and it\u2019s from Mr. Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.", "Kai Pan", "Two follow-ups. One on the buybacks. You did $15 million this quarter, does it mean you are still on track to fulfill the $175 million for the full year? And is there any limitation to do buybacks while you have acquisition pending?", "Dominic Casserley", "We are on track, so it just happened when we started the program, it's all we've done to date. We are still on track to do the program. We do have some limitations which we were given in terms of the price went through the roof on our stocks, so do you want to talk further about that, John?", "John Greene", "So the $175 million that we talked about in February, that's what we intend to do. That will offset the share creep as Dominic mentioned. We did put some threshold in terms of if the stock price goes over a certain level, then from a cash and capital management standpoint it becomes less \u2013 it makes less sense to accelerate buybacks or continue buyback. So if that were the case, the buybacks would taper off.", "Kai Pan", "Last question for Dominic, given the pending Miller and Gras Savoye, two big deal transaction, do you see it would take a pause in terms of large-scale acquisitions and how do you think about risk of going through a big operation restructuring program, while managing the two big integrations?", "Dominic Casserley", "It's a good question. Maybe take the two parts. First of all, let me be clear, our acquisition strategy is not let's go out and buy stuff. It's other interesting specialized franchises which we think would fit well with our organization and do we believe the people in those organizations want to be part of Willis and that's how we ended up sitting down some time ago thinking through which franchises were particularly interesting and which groups of people did we think would blend particularly well into Willis. And what you are seeing is the results of that work undertaken some time ago coming to fruition. And I do not have on the horizon obviously anything of the same scale that we're thinking about in terms of an acquisition.", "Secondly in terms of the management of the business, the good news is that these are actually largely non-overlapping activities. So if you think of the Miller integration that obviously largely involves our management team in London. It is a largely London business and deeply ingrained into our London businesses and you know that we are moving some assets from some people from Miller to Willis and vice versa and that is deeply engaging those management teams.", "Meanwhile the Gras Savoye acquisition involves a different management team. Again, in complementary businesses, in this case with hardly any overlap which makes the integration challenges relatively low and all the upside in terms of cross selling and going to plant together, all upside for people. So the reaction in turn is incredibly positive about the opportunities it creates internally within Gras Savoye and within Willis.", "The operational improvement program cuts across elements of that, but not all elements and we are very much engaged in making sure that the management of that process does not get intertwined are upset by the acquisition activities. It sort of not involved in the Gras Savoye side at all and with Miller it's not really affecting the bits that are moving back and forth. So all in all, we are very comfortable of the way we are managing this.", "Dominic Casserley", "I think that was our last question, is that right? So I\u2019d like to thank everybody for coming and joining our call. Reiterate that we\u2019re very excited about the growth potential and cash flow potential and shareholder value potential of the three parts of our strategy: organic growth, driving an organic margin development, driving value added M&A, and the impact overtime of our operational improvement program. And we look forward to talking to you again in July. Thank you very much indeed.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded.", "I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead", "Aida Sukys", "Good morning. Welcome to the Towers Watson earnings call. I\u2019m here today with John Haley, Towers Watson\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to our website for this morning\u2019s press release.

After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the conference call up for your questions.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we\u2019ll review our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "Before reviewing the detailed quarterly results, I\u2019d like to mention the Saville Consulting Acquisition which was announced on April 27. Saville Consulting adds market leading assessment tools which enhance our already comprehensive suite of HR solutions and advisory services. With that combination, we can better access the fastest growing part of the Talent and Rewards market related to talent management and technology.", "This acquisition will allow us to deliver products that should grow significantly over the next several years consistent with our overall long-term growth portfolio strategy.", "For the third consecutive quarter, we\u2019ve posted strong organic revenue growth. Reported revenues for the quarter were $921 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year third quarter reported revenues and up 7% on an organic and constant currency basis. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures.", "Our EBITDA for the quarter was $205 million or 22% of revenues. The prior year third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $183 million or 20% of revenues. Continued strong top-line results and the focus on cost efficiencies have helped to drive EBITDA and margin.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.49 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.63. Every region experienced revenue growth this quarter. We\u2019re especially pleased to see that EMEA posted strong results for two consecutive quarters now.", "Revenue growth plus cost management over the last two quarters have generated the strongest margins in more than two years. Once again, the Benefits Exchange Solutions and Talent and Rewards segments delivered strong results. Strength in retirement, healthcare consulting and pension administration drove revenue growth and benefits.", "An increase in transaction work demand for technology and timing of survey delivery drove the Talent and Rewards segment revenue growth. A strong fall enrollment season for the Retiree and Active Exchanges and an expanded client base in Health and Welfare Administration, drove revenue growth in the Exchange Solutions segment.", "Now let\u2019s look at the performance of each of our segments. As a reminder, the results for the Benefits and Exchange Solutions segment have been updated to reflect the expansion of the exchange segment. Please refer to our 8-K SEC filing on September 16, 2014 for a historical quarterly view of the impacted results.", "On an organic basis, Benefits revenues increased 5%, Exchange Solutions increased 31%, Risk and Financial Services decreased 3%, and Talent and Rewards increased 15%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance will reference constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $496 million, Retirement revenues increased by 3% due to increased client work and the timing of commissions in EMEA. The higher stream of commissions was originally expected in the fourth quarter of FY15. Demand for consulting projects increased in Asia Pacific as well, as guided U.S. bulk lump sum projects declined as compared to the first half of FY15.", "Health and group benefits revenues grew by 10% driven by planned management consulting and special projects. Technology and Administrations Solutions revenues increased by 6% much of this growth is due to changes in U.K. retirement legislation which led to increased administration work and special projects.", "In North America, we have nine large pension administration clients which are in various stages of the implementation process. As a reminder, revenues are deferred during the implementation of these projects the demand for pension administration continues to be strong. We continue to expect that the Benefits segment will show solid growth for the full fiscal year.", "For the quarter, the Exchange Solutions segment had revenues of $97 million, an increase of 31%. Our Retiree and Access Exchange revenues increased 32% due to an increase in membership base and a strong annual enrollment season. Health and Welfare Administration grew 23% as a result of strong special project work and an increase in administration activity.", "There are currently nine implementations occurring and in various stages of completion. The implementation revenue is deferred until the system goes live. Active Exchanges grew by 76% but really contributed modestly to the overall segment growth as we continue to build that business.", "I\u2019d like to touch base on the current sales cycle for this segment. The Retiree Exchange, which is the most mature exchange offering has a very robust pipeline. We\u2019ve already secured a number of eligible retirees for the 2016 fall annual enrollment, which would likely exceed our 2015 fall annual enrollments.", "Sales activity still continues. In the Active space, sales activity is indicative of continued growth. We\u2019re seeing a higher level of RFP activity from third party contract administrators for mid-size and large companies as compared to this time last year.", "We\u2019ve also received some RFPs for potential 2017 implementations. However, we continue to see small and mid-sized companies implementing at a higher pace and expect this market to drive the majority of revenue growth in fiscal \u201816.", "The Health and Welfare Administration business pipeline continues to be robust and we expect many implementations to go live for the 2016 annual enrollment process.", "Regardless of the line of business, large organizations that decide to enroll their employees during the fall 2015 enrollment process will have to make decisions by the early summer. For smaller organizations serviced by our broker partners, we can extend having the decisions made until the October/November timeframe. We\u2019ll also continue to press for off-cycle enrollment for the Retiree Exchange throughout the fiscal year.", "We\u2019re also very encouraged by the proof of concept in the OneExchange active market. As part of our sales process, we\u2019re continuing to see savings of 5% to 15% by moving from self-insured traditional plans to self-insured exchanges. These savings do not include a buy down.", "In addition to these savings, OneExchange is low market leading inflation rates should ensure future savings. We saw an average employer savings of approximately $1,400 per employee with approximately $500 being passed through to employees. It\u2019s also becoming clear that employees understand how OneExchange works. 93% of employees made informed choices and 83% said they understand their benefits the same or better than the prior year.", "We like our positioning in the market and we remain confident in long-term growth in each of the lines of business in this segment.", "Now let me turn to Risk and Financial Services. For the quarter, the Risk and Financial Services segment had revenues of $156 million as compared to $174 million for the third quarter of fiscal \u201814. Revenues were down 3% due to softness in EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions. Risk Consulting and Software revenues decreased 6%. The performance in Asia Pacific remains weak there were fewer large assignments in EMEA. And the Americas pipeline is mixed.", "We believe the issues in EMEA are more short-term in nature but believe Asia-Pacific will continue to be soft. Investment had 2% revenue growth and experienced growth in each region. Performance fees drove the majority of the growth. While we\u2019ve won several new assignments, we continue to see a slowdown in advisory projects in EMEA as organizations contemplate moving to delegated investment services.", "The Risk Consulting and Software and investment businesses are expected to experience softness for the rest of the fiscal year.", "Next let\u2019s move on to Talent and Rewards, which also delivered very strong results for the quarter. The Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $140 million, a revenue increase of 15%. All lines of business in the Talent and Rewards segments experienced growth for the second consecutive quarter. Executive compensation revenues were up 11%.", "The primary drivers for growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific included IPO and M&A activity and enhanced focus on industry solutions.", "Data, Surveys and Technology revenues increased by 9%. Strong demand for HR software in the delivery of Surveys, which were scheduled for the fourth quarter drove revenue growth. Going forward, several consulting results will be included in Data, Surveys and Technology as their suite of offerings aligns with this product and solution based business.", "Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues increased 23% led by double-digit revenue growth in the Americas and EMEA regions. The growth in the Americas was due to large transaction and transformation related projects plus recognition of revenue associated with communication of OneExchange\u2019s new clients went live.", "The revenues associated with OneExchange project work had been deferred in the first half of the fiscal year. EMEA\u2019s growth related to U.K. M&A activity and pension communication as well as large transformation projects in the Middle East.", "Given the year-to-date revenue growth, we expect Talent and Rewards to have a solid performance for the fiscal year.", "So, we had another great quarter and I\u2019d like to thank all of our associates for their continued client focus. I\u2019d also like to welcome the associates of Saville Consulting to Towers Watson. We\u2019re very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for our companies. We have much in common as we\u2019re committed to putting our clients first, being thought leaders and delivering innovative solutions and technology. We\u2019re excited to have such a strong team join Towers Watson.", "And one last note before I turn the call over to Roger. I\u2019m pleased to announce that Towers Watson has been awarded a World Economic Forum research project on the human implications of digital media. We\u2019ll present our findings during the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2016. This win is a great example of our thought leadership culture and commitment innovation. This is quite an honor for Towers Watson. And I\u2019d like to congratulate and thank the entire team for all of their great work.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks John, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019d also like to add my congratulations to our associates and welcome the associates from Saville Consulting. Historically, acquisitions have not only enhanced our marketing offerings but have helped bring new ideas to the table and fostered greater innovation. I\u2019m really pleased to have the associates from Saville as part of the team and about the enhancements they bring to our market offerings.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to the financial review. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition activity. This was another great quarter as John mentioned with a high level of performance across our key financial metrics.", "We set another quarterly record of EBITDA margin driven by strong project work and cost control in what is normally a high-profit margin quarter. Given the expected volatility of areas such as project work and pension expense, we think the go-forward sustainable margin is more on the 20% range than the 21% range we\u2019ve seen year-to-date.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment NOI margin was really strong at 39%, up from 34% last year. The strong revenue growth in retirement and Health and Group Benefits and cost management drove the margin increase. This was another impressive quarter for the Benefits team. I should note that the March quarter tends to be a strong margin quarter as this is one much of the annual defined benefit pension valuation work has performed.", "Exchange Solutions had a 21% NOI margin as compared to 23% in last year\u2019s third quarter. OneExchange Retiree led this segment with 45% NOI margin as compared to 36% last year. The profitability was driven by a strong annual enrollment season and an increased membership base.", "The overall segment margin also reflected continuing investments in building OneExchange Active and reduced margin in Health and Welfare Administration as they focused on new client transition.", "Risk and Financial Services had a 32% NOI margin, an increase from 30% last year. We continue to see benefits from the restructuring in fiscal 2014 and continued cost management as revenues have been down slightly on a fiscal year-to-date basis.", "Talent and Rewards had a 20% NOI margin as compared to 9% margin in last year\u2019s third quarter. The revenue growth this quarter continued to be very much driven by transaction work. Thus expenses were tightly managed in the quarter.", "Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter was $104 million. Adjusted net income was $114 million. The tax rate for continuing operations for the quarter was 36%. This is higher than the guided tax rate due primarily to one-time items. We expect our full year tax rate to be around 34%.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. At March 31, we had $732 million in available cash. Virtually all of the available cash and short-term investments are outside of the U.S. The purchase of Saville was funded by cash on hand in the U.K. Free cash outflow continues to be strong at $222 million year-to-date as compared to $172 million in fiscal \u201814. For the third quarter of fiscal year \u201815, our free cash flow was $253 million as compared to $230 million for the third quarter last year.", "Free cash flow generally improves through each consecutive quarter during the fiscal year. We continue to anticipate free cash flow for the fiscal year to be in the neighborhood of adjusted net income. We had no borrowings outstanding from our credit facility at the end of the quarter. This is down from $50 million at the end of the second quarter. We repurchased approximately 423,000 of our shares for about $52 million under our $300 million Share Repurchase Authority. We have $188 million remaining on the current Share Repurchase Authority. The acquisition will have no impact on our current repurchase program.", "Let me now turn now to the fiscal \u201815 guidance. Saville Consulting is included in the guidance but has no impact to segment revenue growth or NOI margins. Despite the strong currency headwinds, and the tax rate being on the higher end of our guided range, due to the strong performance of the business this fiscal year-to-date, we continue to hold our revenue guidance and are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance.", "Our full year revenue expectation continues at approximately $3.6 billion, which reflects the absorption of an estimated $90 million in negative currency fluctuations. We absorbed approximately $53 million of negative currency fluctuations through the third quarter of fiscal \u201815 and expect to absorb an additional $40 million in the fourth quarter.", "Due to the continued strong results through the third quarter, we\u2019re increasing our fiscal \u201815 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be within the range of $6.03 to $6.10. We expect our EBITDA margin for the year to be between 20.5% and 21%. We expect the fiscal \u201815 income tax rate to be around 34% which was the high-end of our previous range of 33% to 34%.", "For the full fiscal year, our guidance assumes an average exchange rate of $1.57 to the British pound and an average exchange rate of $1.20 to the euro. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $70 million.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share will continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share. We continue to expect the Benefits segment to have mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth.", "Based on the strength of the revenues and ongoing cost management, we\u2019re increasing the expected NOI margin for Benefits from the low 30% range to the mid-30% range. This will be a tremendous result for the Benefits team driven by their strong productivity in a year with significant project activity. Over the long-term, we continue to expect Benefits margin to be in the low-30% range.", "Next, in Exchange Solutions, due to the continued strong results of the segment, we\u2019re increasing our revenue growth expectation to the mid-30% range. We continue to expect the NOI margin to be in the high-teens. As a reminder, Exchange Solutions profitability is seasonally higher in the second half of the fiscal year.", "In the Risk and Financial Services segment, given the current business performance, we expect revenue to decline by low-single-digits. This is a slight change from the previous guidance which suggested revenues would range from a low-single-digit decline to remaining flat. We continue to maintain the NOI margin expectation in the mid-20% range.", "Finally, in Talent and Rewards, due to the strong revenue growth in the last two quarters, and the effective expense management, we\u2019re increasing our revenue growth expectation to the mid-single to high-single-digits and increasing the expected NOI margin to the low to mid 20% range.", "This was another great quarter and we really like the underlying business momentum as well as the new addition to our business portfolio. I\u2019d like to congratulate our associated on delivering another strong quarter.", "Now back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks Roger. And now we\u2019ll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.", "Q - George Tong", "Hi, thanks, good morning. Can you discuss the progress in your selling season for 2016 in Exchange business and how discussions with potential clients have evolved from last year?", "John Haley", "Well, as we mentioned in the script there, I think we\u2019re seeing an increase in RFPs, we\u2019re particularly seeing an increase in third quarter RFPs from them. We are, so that\u2019s up, there is more interest in that. I think it\u2019s early to say whether that will lead to more sales or not, but there is certainly a lot more interest that we\u2019ve seen as a result to that.", "The other thing I\u2019d say is that we do see adoption rates as being higher in the small and medium sized market than in the medium to large market.", "George Tong", "That\u2019s helpful. And how much contribution from off-cycle selling activity do you expect from Liazon this year? And in addition to Starwood, any other large off-cycle enrollments you expect?", "John Haley", "We don\u2019t have any large off-cycle enrollments that are scheduled at the moment. And Liazon is, Liazon does sell things throughout the year but there are still also one where the bulk of them are January 1 implementations.", "George Tong", "That\u2019s helpful. And then lastly, can you talk about your expectations for margin upside in the Exchange business and how margins have performed relative to your expectations?", "John Haley", "So, I don\u2019t know, Roger, you may want to comment on this. I think the, we had projected margins in the mid-double digits there for Exchange Solutions, in the 15% range or something like that for this year. I think when we think about the upside, we haven\u2019t really given any guidance or any specifics about that. We do think that this is a business that it fit, as it scales, there should be opportunities for margin expansion but we haven\u2019t attempted to quantify that yet.", "Roger Millay", "Yes, I mean, and the only other thing that we\u2019ve said over time with scale that the business on the whole should be at least slightly above where our administration businesses have been, which is kind of an average margin business for us. And just relative to this year, I think we\u2019re pretty much right on the guidance. So, I think we\u2019re on track and then it depends on how fast things build over the next couple of years as to how rapidly the margin comes up.", "George Tong", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company. Your question please.", "Tim McHugh", "Hi, yes, you made the comment about just following up on the Exchange I guess the small mid-market channel. I guess, can you talk about the brokerage relationships it sounds like you\u2019re still seeing a lot of lead flow but have you kept most of the key relationships there, have you developed new ones, just give an update I guess on how as a sales distribution strategy for Liazon at that part of the market how that\u2019s still looking for you guys?", "John Haley", "Yes, so, thanks very much for question Tim. So our current number of broker partnerships with Liazon, that Liazon has is 680 and that\u2019s up from 463 a year ago. And of the top 20, we\u2019re partnered with 13 of the top 20 brokers. So, we\u2019re seeing some increases there, the bigger ones we had both years anyway, so the increases that maybe as dramatic as it seems from the numbers, but still we\u2019re continuing to see the broker channel growth.", "Tim McHugh", "And you haven\u2019t, there\u2019s no attrition of any major ones I guess underlying?", "Roger Millay", "No.", "Tim McHugh", "Okay. And is the comment around the mid to large part of the market meant, I mean I guess is that less than you would\u2019ve expected at this point, or I guess you\u2019re describing growth as kind of that can mean a lot of I think most people expect growth, so I guess how much growth? Yes.", "John Haley", "No, I mean, I just think going into this I think at least I started off with the idea that there was, wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a big difference across by size of company as to how fast they started to adopt it. And as we get into it, we\u2019re seeing that large companies are probably little slower to adopt. And so, that\u2019s really what we were reporting.", "Tim McHugh", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.", "Sara Gubins", "Good morning. First just a question on margins, so your EBITDA margins are up about 210 basis points year-to-date but the guidance suggests that the fourth quarter could be down or maybe up just a very little bit. Could you talk about why the fourth quarter might look so different from the rest of the year?", "And then your comment about sustainable margin being more like 20% might even suggest that we would see margin compression from here. And so I\u2019m trying to think about what would drive margin compression in years to come as opposed to maybe not the same kind of expansion that you\u2019ve seen recently?", "John Haley", "Thanks Sarah. We move on quite quickly as we talk about margins. So, being above 20% at quarters for us, this is the first year that we\u2019ve been there. And as we\u2019ve been talking about the year, with the tremendous activity, project activity we\u2019ve had this year particularly in bulk lump sum, that\u2019s something as we know is episodic in years, where we have that kind of activity it drives much higher margins.", "But we think going forward right now we don\u2019t know whether I guess when the next burst of that kind of activity will be. And so, we think the underlying, the message we\u2019re trying to send is the underlying sustainable margins when we don\u2019t have big project activity like that is more in the 20% range.", "So, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as margin compression, it\u2019s just reflective more of the project volatility that we have in the business.", "Sara Gubins", "Okay. And then, separately on investment could you talk to us about how you\u2019re thinking about longer opportunities in the investment segment particularly given your comment around clients thinking about moving to delegating services? And I\u2019m wondering if you think that you have the right positioning or if you might need to change or add more broadly to your offerings?", "John Haley", "Yes. Well, I think the investment business as you know has been a great business for us with real opportunity. And it\u2019s been on the list really at least since we merged Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt as one of the things that we would target for growth. And we continued to look at that and we think again, the longer - we\u2019ve made longer term organic investments to turn more to delegated and to funds and continue to consider acquisition opportunities that would enhance that movement.", "Sara Gubins", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your question please.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Thank you, guys, and congratulations on the strong quarter. My first question is on the pension and administration side the implementations that you\u2019re doing there\u2019s a good number of them. And when we look at the sort of the P&L implications down the road when the implementations are complete, how should we think about those, when the revenues actually start flowing through what can that mean for the growth rate?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I mean, those, as you know Ashwin, those implementations take some time. But I think the nine that we referred to in John\u2019s remarks are going to start coming in over the next couple of quarters. So, probably mostly during the first half of fiscal \u201816, and so that will add nicely to overall benefits growth, it\u2019s not, those are not of the kind of materiality that they move things as much as like the bulk lump sum projects move them but it will be a nice addition to the growth for this segment next year.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay. And then the small and midsize client demand in Exchange that you mentioned and then in your prepared remarks as well as commented on in answer to the first or second question there. Can you talk a little bit more about sort of the dynamics of this segment in terms of profitability, I would imagine that smaller clients even though they might take longer to decide what to do once they decide it is easier to implement and so on? So, any implications from that?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I think if I followed your question, kind of the impacts of small and medium-sized versus large size client additions.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Right.", "Roger Millay", "Clearly, in terms of driving profitability if you add a big piece of business, I mean, that\u2019s going to accelerate the margin growth. But there is a lot that can go into a very large implementation. So, there is work and cost associated with that. I mean, I think, it\u2019s probably not a word that we used here at Towers Watson, but I think of the small and medium sized business more as a flow kind of a business, I mean, it\u2019s a process, the routine is set up.", "That\u2019s why they\u2019re able to go later in the year with implementations because it\u2019s something that you can do a higher volume in a shorter period of time. So, I think in both cases, scale will build margin but it could be more dramatic and obviously with the big ones we got a couple of big ones at the same time.", "John Haley", "Yes, I think that\u2019s exactly right. The only thing I would add is, just if you think about the point Roger just made that you have to decide the big ones much earlier in the year because they\u2019re more complex, there is more to be done in implementing them. Another way of thinking about that is there is more of an investment from us in terms of putting them up and getting them ready to go. So that probably means you\u2019re more profitable in the long-run once you have them running but there is a bigger short-term investment.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay. And that\u2019s kind of what I was thinking of as well as you can probably keep taking on smaller contracts until let\u2019s call it all various.", "John Haley", "That\u2019s correct.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Yes, okay. My last question if I may the change in mortality rates and so on happening, those assumptions that came out, obviously the impact on cash funding and P&L impact as well for your clients. Can you walk through how that has impacted either one-off project activity to analyze the impact, is that still ongoing, pretty much behind us some? And then how does that just one more thing that finance sponsors then have to think about, right? So does that increase or decrease down the road their desire to do risk transfer or bulk lump sum transfer?", "John Haley", "Yes, so we\u2019ve done some estimates of the impact of the consulting on the mortality assumptions that we think that quarter two, it was probably worth about $8 million in revenue to us, and quarter three probably about $3 million. And this is really at the end of the cycle for this because now that year end is behind them, most companies are not going to continue to examine this assumption at all.", "And in fact that the $3 million that we think we got this quarter is actually less than we got in the quarter three last year from people looking ahead and see what the mortality assumption would be.", "So, I think, I think it was not in, it was something that we were glad to get that extra revenue but it\u2019s, I think it\u2019s pretty much gone now.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Got it, thank you guys.", "John Haley", "Okay.", "Roger Millay", "Okay, yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your question please.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. John, I\u2019m just trying to gauge what you are referring to in terms of the Actives exchange. Is there an increase in competitive issues going on that makes it sound like it\u2019s just a little bit at least the tone seems a little bit slower or is it just hesitation from big clients to pull the trigger? That seems a little bit frustrating. And am I reading you correctly that it really seems just a little bit slower than what you had been expecting?", "John Haley", "Yes. I think if I were to, if I were to think about my own personal expectations as to how this was going to work, frankly it\u2019s not really any different than what I projected. There had been a number of studies that came out that had sort of explosive growth occurring in the first few years there.", "And so, I think a lot of the times when we\u2019re on the calls, we\u2019re answering questions about comparisons to some of that explosive growth. I think a couple of things, what we were trying to characterize though about the large and the small and medium sized and the difference in the take-up rates, I think one of the things that happens is large clients have the tendency to go through an RFP process for things.", "And when they go through an RFP process, it involves, it\u2019s not just that\u2019s more cumbersome in it of itself it tends to involve more areas of the business. And so they\u2019re looking at it. And so that\u2019s just inherently a slower process.", "And I think from our standpoint, we think we have a big competitive advantage in the large market and so we would like to see the large market, going as faster and faster than the small to medium size. We\u2019re happy to get business anywhere. But we would like to be able to take advantage of our competitive advantage there.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "So, are you guys tracking in line with what you thought last quarter? I mean, last quarter basically the Actives looked like they were going to be a little bit lighter and the Retirees were going to be a little bit larger ending the year at about 1.2 million. Are you still tracking along those lines?", "John Haley", "Yes, we\u2019re tracking right in line with that Shlomo. And I mean, one of the things, I\u2019m glad you asked this question. We didn\u2019t intend to give the impression that things are slower than we had been projecting, they\u2019re not. And in fact as I said, we\u2019re actually seeing more RFPs.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Okay. And then I talked to one of your clients who said that the costs were actually 8% lower than what they had initially expected from being on the Exchange. And I was just wondering when you have clients that are actually experiencing that how easy is it or is it still a challenge to go ahead and approach some of the other clients and say hey, this is a meaningful change or how hard is it to turn a reference-able client into nudging them over the edge?", "John Haley", "Well, I think the - every turn we have one of these client experiences or they get on to the Exchange, they see how much their employees like it, and they see how much they can save. And I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s typical for our clients\u2019 cost to be 8% less than they had expected it would be. But in general, we are reasonably conservative in projecting what the cost savings are, so, almost all of our clients see costs that are even less than we had projected.", "And that\u2019s a positive message I think to take out there. And I think it is something that distinguishes some of our projections from maybe some others.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Okay and one last one just for Roger. How much of the revenue in the quarter would you say were some timing pull forward from what you initially expected in the fourth quarter?", "Roger Millay", "I don\u2019t have a number off hand. I will say Shlomo that if you maybe to put the question in a different vein, we ended up at 7% constant currency growth. I think we expected for the second half of the year to be more mid-single-digit so we were probably at couple of points ahead of where we expected to be. And I think we\u2019re still saying over the fourth quarter that we expect to be in the mid-single-digit, maybe a point or so in growth below where we otherwise would have been. So I think it\u2019s in those kinds of orders of magnitude.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Your question please. You might have your phone on mute.", "Dave Styblo", "Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I want to circle back to the Exchanges here real quickly and come back to a comment that you said about the Retiree side if we could feather out the two segments. On the Retiree side I think you said you\u2019d expect enrollment in \u201816 to look similar to the \u201815. Are we talking something in the magnitude of about 200,000, 250,000 lives? Is that what you are sort of insinuating in those comments?", "Roger Millay", "I\u2019m not sure. So the comments were that what we\u2019ve, the commitments we have from clients now that that would equal based on our estimates of how many of the eligible and how many would actually roll that we\u2019re right now at about a place that would be equal to or better than the enrollments that we had at 1/1/15 and the sales season goes on.", "So, we didn\u2019t give a number but we had about 160,000 enrollments on 1/1/15. So I think those are the data points that we have.", "Dave Styblo", "Okay, yes, that\u2019s what I was looking for. That\u2019s helpful. And then so, moving over to the Retiree side, I completely understand your comments about the adoption and we\u2019ve been hearing that from some of your peers, too, that the smaller and midsize are adopting a little bit faster. Is the net result of all that so far sort of steady Eddie growth as she goes or can, I\u2019m trying to also triangulate with comments that you said in there about seeing higher RFPs. Is the net result of all that growth, enrollment growth that would be faster in terms of total numbers than what you experienced this year the same or is there possibly somewhat of a slowdown or deceleration in growth on that side of the business?", "John Haley", "I don\u2019t think we see a slowdown in the growth there. I think we probably see something more like what we\u2019ve seen in the last year. I think, as we look at our over say the next several years, we\u2019re looking at maybe 30 million employees in our addressable market to move to private exchanges within the next five to seven years, I mean, we still think that\u2019s a reasonably good number.", "It is hard to predict the adoption rate year-by-year, but we do get a sense that the adoption rates will pick up in advance of 2018 when the excise tax is implemented. And we\u2019re still targeting about 25% market share.", "Dave Styblo", "Okay.", "Roger Millay", "I\u2019ll just add maybe just to this theme of the RFPs and everything. I mean, I think we do all need to consider, while it\u2019s hard to build models today. The reason we\u2019re pointing out the RFP activity was that last year at this time there was very little RFP activity. So to us, that\u2019s a very positive indicator that the market continues to grow, the interest is strong. That\u2019s what you would expect to see.", "So, I think we see positive signs out there even though getting decisions made is, it\u2019s a longer process obviously than the small and mid-size market.", "Dave Styblo", "Okay, thanks for the color on that. Kind of coming back to the previous question more so on a year-to-date basis the results have been obviously strong and peppered with several comments of timing or transactional or M&A related that suggest some of it might be not necessarily recurring or sustainable. So, along those lines on the top line do you have a sense of what percent of the revenue is recurring or sustainable over the longer term here?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, I just say to try and characterize this is as well as we can. Certainly again the bulk lump sum activity which we said last quarter was running at a rate of 50 million to 60 million in the first half of the year and we thought it was going to be down to 10 million or 12 million in the second half of the year. So that gives you some order of magnitude for the bulk lump sum and what the variability might be.", "And this year is quite similar actually to the year we had in fiscal \u201813 where we had that big surge also on bulk lump sum. So, that gives you an idea, and again we don\u2019t know what fiscal \u201816 is going to look like in bulk lump sum activity.", "Otherwise we do, we comment on the project activity, the M&A driven activity, not to say that we won\u2019t have that next quarter or in the couple of quarters after that. But that it\u2019s just less predictable. We\u2019re in an environment, now we\u2019re that activity is strong. We\u2019re running, we think again the underlying run-rate for the business is mid-single-digits kind of revenue growth but that\u2019s looking across several quarters.", "So, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s an environment, it\u2019s a strong environment for us, I think that\u2019s the theme that we really wanted to get out in our remarks. But it\u2019s, quarter-to-quarter little more difficult to predict.", "Dave Styblo", "Okay. And if I could just lastly squeeze one in on housekeeping for FX I think you had called out $90 million of headwinds being absorbed this year. How does that change in fiscal year \u201816? How much incremental FX headwind do you expect based on how things are shaking out at this point?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I wish I knew. I would say so, the big drop can\u2019t put a precise data on it, but it was around the turn of the calendar year that FX pressure increased. So from a year-over-year point of view, if things stay around where they are now, the first half of next year would have pressure as well, and then we\u2019d start laughing the periods of rates where they are now in the second half of fiscal \u201816. But it\u2019s quite a bit of volatility right now, so it\u2019s difficult to say exactly where we\u2019re going to be.", "Dave Styblo", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Summer from SunTrust, your question please.", "Frank Atkins", "Hi there, thanks this is Frank in for Tobey. I wanted to ask quickly out about the Saville Consulting acquisition. Any color you can give us on either margins or profitability there relative to this kind of core business or potential opportunities you see for that acquisition as it impacts profitability going forward?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, I mean, as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s relatively small to relative to the total company. But we expect that their margins will be at or, they\u2019ll add into Talent and Rewards, at or slightly above the margins that we run at now.", "Frank Atkins", "Okay, great, that\u2019s helpful. And there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty regarding healthcare reform and private exchanges as we go into the Supreme Court ruling. Are there any features that could change that may impact the adoption rate or the long-term prospects in terms of regulatory environment?", "John Haley", "We don\u2019t, I think if the plaintiffs succeed there, the question then would be what kind of changes are made to, how Congress and the President react to that. So, aside from any financial implications that might apply to employers if their exposure to employer mandate penalties is reduced, they could face significant strategy decisions for addressing different rules across the states.", "They could have challenges in communicating and educating their employees about any new landscape. And all of those things would probably increase our healthcare and communication and change management consulting work in the light of the decision. But it probably depends on what happens.", "It runs from unless there is some big changes that Congress and the President would agree to in the light of a particular decision there, it runs from I think not much impact to maybe a little positive.", "Frank Atkins", "Okay. And lastly I wanted to ask about off-cycle enrollments. Can you remind us what that means for the business model and what you guys are doing to initiatives to drive off-cycle enrollment?", "John Haley", "Well, I mean, one of the things, what it does for the business model is it enables us to keep a cadre of our more experienced benefit operatives there throughout the year, and to keep them employed full-time. And that helps, it\u2019s a more attractive proposition for those individuals. It keeps them at the company and make sure that they\u2019re ready to go even when the on-cycle enrollments come up.", "And so, one of the things we like to do is to offer employers the option to do the off-cycle, they probably get more attention and somewhat better service as a result of doing that. We don\u2019t have any other particularly big differences that we do there. But some people like the idea of getting the extra attention in service.", "Frank Atkins", "All right, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please.", "Greg Peters", "Good morning. Thank you for hosting the call. If we reflect on all your comments on the special assignment work consolidated margins and if you step back and you are able to achieve your earnings per share target of $6.03 to $6.10. I\u2019m just curious how much of that results will be attributable to the special assignment bulk lump sum one-time project work?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I mean, again, so you have the bulk lump sum numbers that we talked about earlier. So I think 60 million this year roughly versus 30 million or so in fiscal \u201814. And you have the enhancement and the Benefits margins. Again otherwise, I mean, I don\u2019t have a number for you but we\u2019ve talked about the M&A type projects in Talent and Rewards, that\u2019s one of the accelerant.", "So, there is probably somewhere around I don\u2019t know three to five points of the growth would be a ballpark number off the top of my head, maybe in the Talent and Rewards growth that is project driven, which is not a huge number for the company. But so those are the main things that I would think about.", "Greg Peters", "On the Risk and Financial Services segment, can you provide further color around the performance of the consulting and software component? Can you speak to any opportunity if there exists any for growth in that business going forward?", "Roger Millay", "Just in the software side or?", "Greg Peters", "Software and the consulting split the chunk into two pieces.", "Roger Millay", "Well, I mean, we\u2019ve said, we haven\u2019t really quantified but the software piece has been growing impressively in the last couple of years. And we expect it to continue to grow in the consulting side, particularly again as you\u2019ll recall, a year or so ago 15 to 18 months or so took a pretty big step-down. So, we continue to be in an environment with kind of modest consulting decline, mostly offset by software growth.", "Greg Peters", "At what point do you expect the consulting side to bottom out?", "Roger Millay", "I mean, I think as we\u2019ve talked about before, they are generally big project cycles in that business where you\u2019d have a surge of M&A type activity or a big change in the regulatory environment. And really those are the kinds of things that it generally takes to move that business to higher level of revenue performance. And we don\u2019t see that right now.", "Greg Peters", "Okay. Thanks for those answers, Roger. Just one follow-up on the Exchange front especially in the context of your comments about small and midsize companies and their take-up rates there. Are you seeing any difference in appetite between the fully insured versus the self-insured options and can you also speak to your competitive position relative to the other private health insurance exchange owners?", "John Haley", "Are you, okay, go ahead.", "Roger Millay", "I mean, I think in general that we\u2019d say that the demand environment for fully versus self is not much different than you would have expected when we started on the Actives Exchanges. And that\u2019s a part of what\u2019s driving the growth in the small and mid sector which historically has had more fully insured exposure. And the growth is more in fully insured in the small and midsize sector. And in the large sector which is greater than 90% self insured that\u2019s where the interest is there, which is why we introduce self-insured. So, I think it\u2019s not that different than we would have expected.", "Greg Peters", "And just to close out on your competitive position relative to the other private health insurance exchange owners, are you seeing any new features from your competitors that have you concerned or just provide a brief update on that? And that\u2019s the last question.", "Roger Millay", "Yes, I don\u2019t think the environment is changed all that much. I mean, I think we\u2019re pleased with the approach that we took in terms of defining the product line of one exchange where we provide the capabilities across the board that our clients would want. And that we own our assets, I think that\u2019s proven to be a competitive advantage. So I don\u2019t think there have been any real changes in how competitors have approached the market recently. But I think it has validated our approach that we established a couple of years ago.", "Greg Peters", "Perfect. Thanks for your answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your question please.", "Andrew Steinerman", "Good morning. I had a question about the managed care organizations like Aetna that have put out their own exchange albeit a one carrier exchange but it does give employees an exchange option with more choice. Have you seen any change in the competitive landscape versus those carriers?", "John Haley", "Not really.", "Andrew Steinerman", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.", "Paul Ginocchio", "Thanks. Hi John I don\u2019t know if you wanted to update where we might be for active enrollment at the end of fiscal \u201815 relative to your earlier expectations I think of almost shy of 300,000 net new enrollments. And also John looking at your Investment Consulting division maybe thinking about where you want that business to be in a couple of years. Would you add asset management to that or would you rather just add more Investment Consulting, investment outsourcing and sort of picking managers? Thanks.", "John Haley", "Yes, okay, thanks Paul. So, I think we\u2019re still on target for the original projections we had for the Active Exchange enrollments, so.", "Roger Millay", "Yes, well as the same as we characterized last time are in total, we were there, but we were a little bit shy.", "John Haley", "As he said, just shy of 300,000, yes.", "Roger Millay", "And little more on Retirees.", "John Haley", "Yes. So, we\u2019re still there. I think on the investment side, we would, we have added some funds in the last year or so, and so I think we\u2019re - we think that fits in well with the whole idea of delegated investment solutions anyway. And so, we look at expanding those, I think we consider that. But we do think just we are very much thinking that the notion of the delegated investment solutions approach is the one we want to be following.", "Paul Ginocchio", "That\u2019s more through your current rollout of these different pooled funds, correct, not necessarily adding investment management?", "John Haley", "Not necessarily adding even more investment management, no. I mean, we wouldn\u2019t roll that out but it\u2019s not necessarily, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s integral to the strategy there.", "Paul Ginocchio", "Great. Thanks, John.", "John Haley", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Due to time constraints our final question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.", "Andre Benjamin", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. I don\u2019t know if you answered this already, I\u2019m jumping on a bit late but as I think about the margins for the various businesses you took up guidance for the quarter, or sorry this quarter for the year on the back of strong revenues and cost containment. Is there any reason why we should not assume stable or even continued expansion as we look into next year?", "John Haley", "Yes, so maybe I\u2019ll just maybe just try to characterize this and Roger may want to jump in with some more details on this. But if I think about last year and our margins, and one of the questions we were getting was, could we get our margins up to 20%. And this year, we\u2019ve not only gotten them up to 20% but they\u2019re actually somewhat over 20%.", "And the only caution we\u2019re giving to people is, we\u2019ve gotten them, we actually want to declare victory on the 20% and say we surely can get them there, and we think that that\u2019s a good run rate. We think a couple of things that have gone well have contributed to being somewhat above 20% this year. And our caution is just to say let\u2019s be careful about building that in for the future. But we\u2019re pretty pleased that we\u2019ve managed to get it up to what we think is the 20% as an ongoing run-rate for us.", "Andre Benjamin", "Thank you.", "John Haley", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to John Haley for closing comments.", "John Haley", "Okay, great. Thanks very much everyone for joining us this morning. And we look forward reviewing our fourth quarter results with you in August.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.", "Aida Sukys", "Good morning, thank you. Welcome to the Towers Watson earnings call. I\u2019m here today with John Haley, Towers Watson\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer. Please refer to our website for this morning\u2019s press release. Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available for replay via telephone for tomorrow by dialing 404-537-3406, conference ID 92166490. The replay will be available for the next three months in our website.", "This conference call shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities nor shall there be any sales of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration of qualifications under security of law of any such jurisdiction. No offer of security shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirement of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended.", "In connection with the proposed merger of Towers Watson and Willis, Willis plans to file with the SEC, a registration statement, on Form S-4 in connection with the transaction. Willis and Towers Watson plan to file with the SEC and mail to the respective shareholders a joint proxy statement prospectus in the connection with the transaction. The registration statement and the joint proxy statement perspectives will contain important information about Willis, Towers Watson, the transaction and related matters. Investors and securityholders are urged to read those registration statements, the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the other related documents carefully when they\u2019re available.

Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this earnings call.", "During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income or adjusted earnings per share. For a discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures under Regulation G to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release and the accompanying financial tables we posted on our website this morning. After our prepared remarks, we will open the conference call for your questions.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks Aida. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we\u2019ll review our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and review our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and also provide some context for the full-year fiscal 2016. We ended the year with the same strong momentum we\u2019ve seen in each quarter throughout this fiscal year. Reported revenues for the quarter were $888 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year fourth quarter reported revenues, up 7% on a constant currency basis and up 6% on an organic basis. Our organic growth rate adjusts for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures.", "Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $180 million or 20.3% of revenues. The prior-year fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $169 million or 19.2% of revenue. Continued strong topline results and the focus on cost efficiencies have helped drive EBITDA margins. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.28 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.51. We\u2019re very pleased with fourth quarter results and this record setting fiscal year, it\u2019s been rewarding to see our long-term growth strategy take hold and gain momentum. The record revenue growth, EBITDA margin and EPS results we\u2019ve seen this year are a testament to our unwavering commitment to our clients and continued focus on our long-term growth strategy TW 2020.", "We\u2019ve building towards this strategy is a couple of ways through acquisitions and by developing a culture of innovation. We focus many of our acquisitions since the creation of Towers Watson with an eye towards this framework. EMB, a provider of premier consulting and software solutions to the insurance industry and Aliquant, a health and welfare benefits administration solution provider were added shortly after the creation of Towers Watson. We then acquired Extend Health through which we entered the retiree exchange market and Liazon which expanded our capabilities in the active exchange market.", "This year, we added Saville Consulting and Acclaris to our portfolio. Saville Consulting adds market leading assessment tools which enhance our already comprehensive suite of HR solutions and advisory services. Mostly recently, we acquired Acclaris, a technology and services provider for consumer driven healthcare which will enhance our health and welfare administration and active exchange products. Acclaris will also broaden our distribution channel through white-labeling technology and service offerings to other benefits administrators and provide a platform for future innovation.", "We\u2019ve also successfully developed a culture of innovation with the structured approach to bringing great ideas to the market. We've been able to deliver solutions such as bulk-lump sum, the UK master trust and global healthcare brokerage by encouraging collaboration and rewarding innovation. Innovation is an important component of the TW 2020 strategy and that allows us to take the best ideas from our associates to keep ahead of trends and meet the needs of our clients.", "Fostering this environment helps create more value for our clients, an interesting and challenging work environment for our associates and ultimately, value for our shareholders. While the concept of innovation seems straightforward, it requires discipline and hard work to ensure success.", "Our management team and associates have done a great job in both assessing acquisition opportunities that enhance our long-term growth strategy and developing solutions that meet our client needs and deepening those relationships. ", "The proposed merger between Towers Watson and Willis will accelerate our TW 2020 strategy. As we invest in developing a more robust suite of products and solutions, a key to maximizing revenue and earnings growth is the penetration of both the large and mid-markets. While Towers Watson has deep penetration in the large market, Willis brings a great brand name and distribution network in the US middle market.", "We believe that not only will Willis Towers Watson deliver on the cost, tax and revenue synergies that we\u2019ve already discussed, but we\u2019re also excited about the prospects the merger will have to strengthen the culture of innovation and continued operational efficiencies. Needless to say, we\u2019re very excited about the long-term prospects this merger presents.", "Now, let's look at the performance of each of our segments. As a reminder, the results for the Benefits and Exchange Solutions segments have been updated to reflect the expansion of the Exchange segment. Please refer to our 8-K filed with the SEC on September 16, 2014 for a historical quarterly view of the impacted results.", "On an organic basis, Benefits revenues increased 3%; Exchange Solutions increased 25%; Risk and Financial Services decreased 2% and Talent and Rewards increased 15%. All of the revenue results discussed in this segment detail in guidance will reference constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $473 million. Retirement revenues increased 1%, led by increased client work in EMEA and offset by a slight decline in North America. Health and Group Benefits revenues grew by 7%, primarily driven by plan management consulting and special projects.", "Technology and administration Solutions revenues increased by 3%. Much of the growth continues to be related to changes in UK retirement legislation, which led to increased administration work in special projects.", "In North America, we have a number of large pension administration projects, which will go live throughout FY16. As a reminder, revenues are deferred during the implementation of these projects. The demand for pension administration continues to be strong. As a result of the strong revenue growth from bulk-lump sum work in FY15, we expect that the Benefits segment will have flat to low single digit revenue growth during FY16.", "For the quarter, the Exchange Solutions segment had revenues of $98 million, an increase of 31%. Our Retiree and Access Exchange revenues increased 30%, due to an increase in membership base and a strong annual enrolment season. The other exchange solutions businesses increased 33% and 16% on an organic basis.", "Components of this line include health and welfare administration, active exchanges and consumer directed accounts. Health and welfare administration grew 6% as a result of strong special project work and an increase in administration activity. A number of ongoing implementations are expected to go live as of January 2016. Active exchanges grew by 88% or almost $3 million as a result of increased membership. We ended FY15 with approximately 1.2 million members on our one exchange platform.", "Before getting into the sales season, I\u2019d like to take a step back and reflect on the development of the exchange business. A lot has been accomplished in a relatively short amount of time. We acquired Extend Health at the end of FY12. During FY13, we introduced the self-insured platform of one exchange active and one exchange access, a service to help companies optimize subsidies available to their employees through the public exchanges.", "During FY14, we acquired Liazon, adding fully funded healthcare options, ancillary benefits and robust group of channel partners. To put further contrast around the pace of adoption, as of June 2013, we had approximately 400,000 members on OneExchange Retiree and about 40,000 covered lives representing two beta clients on the Active OneExchange platform.", "We had also provided OneExchange Access advisory services to three early adopter organizations. As of June 2015, we had almost 1.2 million members on the OneExchange platform and had provided OneExchange Access services to more than 30 clients. We strongly believe we have the most comprehensive exchange offering in the market for businesses of any size and their eligible participants from part-time to full-time employees and pre- and post-65 retirees.", "Now let\u2019s turn to the current sales season and I will provide some color around the development of the 2016 and 2017 pipelines as well. We anticipate a record annual enrolment period for January 1, 2016 with approximately 220,000 retirees enrolling this year versus approximately 160,000 enrolled as of January 1, 2015. Sales activity will continue into the second half of the FY16.", "In the Active space, we finalized sales from approximately 100,000 eligible employees for the 2016 annual enrolment season. This time last year we had approximately 30,000 eligible employees scheduled for the annual enrolment period in addition to a large off-cycle enrolment which occurred in the spring of 2015. The sales to-date reflect approximately 70% sold directly by our associates and 30% by the brokers\u2019 channel.", "Sales efforts in the midmarket will continue through October, so these enrolment numbers will continue to grow. The broker channel will continue to sell and enroll members throughout the year as many small companies can implement off-cycle enrolments. It\u2019s still too early to provide a count for total fiscal year enrolments. We\u2019ve also contacted with 33 new Access clients for this enrolment season.", "As we look at the 2017 annual enrolment sales activity, the large market, as defined as organizations with more than 20,000 employees, comprise a more significant portion of the current RFP activity than we saw during the 2016 selling season. However, it\u2019s early in the selling season and although it is a bit of uptick in large company activity, we believe the midmarket will continue to be a strong driver of exchange growth as this market builds.", "We will also have our first client utilizing all three OneExchange platforms Retiree, Access and Actives. One of our objectives is to utilize our strong relationships and the high satisfactory levels of our retiree clients as we focus our marketing activities in the Actives business. We remain confident in the long-term growth in each of the lines of business in this segment and expect strong growth in FY16.", "For the quarter, Risk and Financial Services had a revenue decline of 2% due to softness in EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions. Risk Consulting and Software revenues decreased 1%. The Americas region experienced revenue growth, but that increase was offset by declines in EMEA and Asia Pacific. The EMEA decline was anticipated due to a very tough comparable as FY14 quarter four growth rate was at 14%. The pipeline from the Americas and EMEA has been somewhat stronger this past quarter. Asia Pacific may continue to be soft in the near term.", "Investment revenue decreased by 3%. Revenue growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific was offset by EMEA revenue declines. By way of comparison, in quarter four of FY14, EMEA revenue increased by 12% as a result of timing of the payment of performance fees. We're seeing more robust pipeline for delegated investment services across all regions. The Risk Consulting and Software and Investment businesses are expected to have moderate revenue growth for fiscal year \u201816.", "Next, let's move on to Talent and Rewards, which delivered very strong results for the quarter. The Talent and Rewards segment had revenues of $145 million, an increase of 17%. Executive Compensation revenues were up 11% with continued strong market momentum carrying over the last three quarter. Transaction work drove revenue growth in the Americas and long-term incentive and regulatory changes drove revenues in Asia-Pacific. Data service and technology revenues increased by 25%. Revenue continue to be driven by strong demand for HR software. We also saw strong demand in North America and EMEA for employee engagement surveys. This is the first sale season, where we are fully utilizing our new technology platform and we\u2019re very pleased with the results. We\u2019ve expanded market share and 40% of our new contracts are multiyear, up from around 20% to 25% just a year ago. Results in this line of business also include our Saville Consulting Acquisition.", "Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues increased 14%, led by double-digit revenue growth in the Americas and EMEA regions. The growth in the Americas was due to a combination of large transaction and business transformation-related projects, communication work related to healthcare plants and increases in sales compensation support. Revenue growth in EMEA was focused on talent management and transaction work.", "The environment continues to look very positive for the Talent and Rewards segment but as a result of the strong FY \u201915 revenue growth, we expect mid-single digit revenue growth in FY \u201916. However, if transaction activity continues for the year, we would expect [Technical Difficulty] higher growth.", "We had another great quarter and simply an outstanding year. I\u2019d like to thank all of our associates for the dedication and continued client focus and to think our clients for allowing Towers Watson the privilege of being your trusted advisor. Before turning the call over to Roger, I\u2019d like to welcome to Dean Mason, the CEO of Acclaris, who will continue to lead the consumer directed account business and all of the Acclaris associates to Towers Watson. We\u2019re very excited to have them join our team.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over the Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019ve a few initial points to make before getting into the financial results. First, I want to add my thanks to our associates for a truly outstanding year. We should all be very proud of Towers Watson\u2019s record-breaking financial results and of the great strides we\u2019ve made towards our TW 2020 strategy. Bottom line, it was a great year. So, here is a big virtual high five to the team.", "Second, I want to echo John\u2019s earlier statement regarding the Willis merger. I\u2019m really excited about the opportunity in front of us. This is a transformative event that will create value for our associates, clients, and shareholders. The cost savings, tax and revenue synergies that we\u2019ve focused on in the transaction economics are only the beginning of the story. Towers Watson, created by a merger of equals, brought us financial strength and flexibility, a top pool of talent and a vehicle to take our best ideas to market. I believe we found a similar opportunity in partnering with Willis, where together we\u2019ll build a stronger Company and create more value for stakeholders than we could as two separate companies.", "Finally, I also want to welcome the Acclaris team. I\u2019m excited about the market opportunity this acquisition brings to Towers Watson. This breaks us into the fast growing health savings account administration market as well as other consumer-driven accounts.", "Now, for the financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of discretionary compensation and other unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition accounting costs. For the quarter, the Benefits segment NOI margin was really strong at 36%, up from 33% last year. The revenue growth in Retirement and Health and Group Benefits and cost management, particularly in EMEA drove the margin increase. The EMEA margin increased by 60% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201915 as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201914 as a result of increased utilization, the impact of centralized operations and restructuring. This was another really impressive quarter from the Benefits team.", "Exchange solutions had a 15% NOI margin as compared to 23% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. One exchange retiree led the segment with the 44% NOI margin. The profitability was driven by an increased membership base. Margin was a big softer in Q4 year-over-year as the seasonal hiring process began a bit earlier than normal in preparation for the upcoming very large annual enrolment period. The segment margin also reflected continuing investments in enhancing the OneExchange active products and services, both in the large and mid-market updating reporting requirements mandated by the ACA and new client transitions. ", "Risk and Financial Services had a 23% NOI margin. While segment revenues declined slightly, strong cost management and the risk consulting and software line of business, kept the profit margin relatively flat. ", "Talent and Rewards had an 18% NOI margin as compared to 8% margin in the fourth quarter last year. Just as we experienced in the previous two quarters, strong revenue growth combined with tight expense management resulted in strong margin growth. ", "Just one final note on the full year fiscal 2015 results. More than 70% of the revenue growth fell directly to the bottom line, which helped Talent and Rewards post a record 26% NOI margin, a great year for the T&R team. ", "Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter was $89 million. Adjusted net income was $105 million. The tax rate for continuing operations for the quarter was 32%. The year-end tax rate came in as forecasted at 34%. This tax rate represents a more normalized rate than in fiscal 2014, when the rate was at 28% due to favorable tax settlements and non-recurring items. ", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. At June 30, we had $815 million in available cash and short-term investments. This is at a peak point of on balance sheet cash for us as we pay our annual bonuses in September. Virtually all of the available cash and short-term investments are outside of the US.", "Free cash flow continued to be very strong at $502 million for the fiscal year as compared to $391 million in fiscal 2014, a 28% increase. For the fourth quarter, our free cash flow was $280 million as compared to $219 million in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow strength for the year was driven by our strong business results and year-over-year bonus differences. Going forward, we continue to anticipate free cash flow to be in the neighborhood of adjusted net income. ", "In addition to our term loan, we had $70 million of borrowings outstanding on our credit facilities at the end of the quarter. The proceeds were primarily used to acquire Acclaris. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 261,000 of our shares for about $34 million under our $300 million share repurchase authority. For the fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 640,000 more shares than in fiscal 2014. We have a $154 million remaining on the current share repurchase authority. However, due to the pending merger with Willis, we have suspended our share repurchase program for the time being. ", "Now, let\u2019s review our guidance for fiscal year 2016. Today, we'll provide you with the first quarter guidance, as well as some context for our full year fiscal 2016 outlook. This guidance excludes the HR service delivery practice, any potential impact of ongoing tax examinations and any impact of the merger with Willis. ", "For example, items related to the Willis merger will be excluded from our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS measures. These items could include legal costs, bankers\u2019 costs, integration costs, tax related matters and other merger and integration related items. These costs could be material as we work through to the closing of the merger. ", "For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues will be in the range of $870 million to $885 million. On a constant currency basis, this correlates to a growth rate of 5% to 6%. Reported growth is expected to be in the flat to 2% range as we lose about $40 million of revenue year-over-year due to the strengthening of the US dollar based on our currency assumptions. ", "Our EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 19.0% to 19.5%. We expect that adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.35. This includes a year-over-year negative impact due to currency translation of approximately $0.04. Average diluted shares outstanding are expected to be around 69.3 million. We expect the first quarter of our fiscal 2016 income tax rate to be in the 34% to 35% range. Our first quarter guidance assumes an average exchange rate of $1.55 to the British pound and $1.10 to the euro. GAAP diluted earnings per share will continue to be lower than our adjusted diluted earnings per share.", "Now we will review our first quarter guidance for the segments. We expect the Benefits segment constant currency revenue to be in the range of flat to low single-digit decline when compared to Q1 fiscal \u201815 revenues. The bulk-lump sum projects drove revenue growth of 9% in the Americas in the first quarter of fiscal \u201915 creating a strong comparable for the segment. The NOI margin for Benefits is expected to be in the low-30% range as a result of a top line bulk-lump sum related slowdown.", "Next in the Exchange Solutions segment, we expect low to mid-30% constant currency revenue growth. We\u2019ve begun the hiring of seasonal workers earlier than in past years in anticipation of the upcoming strong retiree annual enrolment season. We want to ensure we maintain our high quality standards which is a key differentiator in the retiree marketplace. We will also continue to enhance our exchange products and user tools and prepare for growth in the Health and Welfare Benefits Administration.", "We expect the first quarter NOI margin for Exchange Solutions to be around 10%. As a reminder, Exchange Solutions profitability is seasonally low in the first half of the fiscal year as we incur all the costs of the annual enrolment period in the first half, but only recognize revenue on a monthly basis starting with the effective date of the policy.", "Next, in the Risk and Financial Services segment, we expect constant currency revenue growth of flat to low single digits. We expect the NOI margin to be in the mid-20% range which historically has been in the mid-teens in the Q1.", "In Talent and Rewards, we expect mid-to-high single-digit constant currency revenue growth as we see continuing momentum in the pipeline. Higher levels of growth are dependent on the continuation of transaction driven activity. We expect the NOI margin to be in the mid-to-high 20% range. As a reminder, margins in this segment are seasonally higher in the first half of the fiscal year.", "Let's step back now for a comment on the full year for fiscal 2016. I would like to reiterate that this commentary excludes any impact from the Willis merger. Overall, we expect mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth which includes continuing momentum in comparison to the very strong fiscal \u201815 results. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to continue to be at the current record run rate of around 21%. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to increase in the mid single digits, but slightly below the level of constant currency revenue growth as we expect around a $0.12 negative currency impact based on our foreign currency assumptions. We expect capital expenditures to be around our historical average. This guidance assumes an average exchange rate of $1.55 to the British pound and an average exchange rate of $1.10 to the euro.", "In closing, it's been a great quarter and fiscal year. While we see some headwinds for FY16 in currency translation and a decreased demand relative to bulk-lump sum, we feel positive about the underlying business and the momentum we are seeing in the market.", "Now I'll turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Okay, thanks, Roger, and now we will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Thank you, guys, and congratulations on a good solid quarter.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Ashwin", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "My first question was if you could help us size the bulk lump sum revenue and profit impact for fiscal 2015, and it seems like your view is that, that is not sustainable at the same level. So if you can go into sort of the pipeline and the reasons why you think it might not be sustainable. ", "Roger Millay", "Sure, Ashwin, I\u2019ll give some numbers on that one and John may have some additional context. I would say at this point, demand is looking a little bit stronger than probably we\u2019ve said on calls the last couple of quarters, but still not at the level going into 2016 that we had in fiscal 2015. ", "So we ended fiscal 2015 at somewhere around $70 million or $75 million of revenues, it looks like fiscal 2016 might be around half of that or so. And the run rate for the quarters maybe at more or like in the first couple of quarters here, more in the $10 million to $15 million range versus in the around $30 million or so per quarter in the first half of fiscal 2015. So I think overall it\u2019s kind of in the first half of fiscal 2016 about half the run rate last year. ", "John Haley", "Yeah, I guess the only other thing I\u2019d add to that Ashwin about the projections is, and we\u2019ve really been saying this for several years now is that this is a business that has a lot of granularity to it. So you will find particular quarters and particular years where you\u2019ll see revenues spike up and then they will return back. So when you look at what we are projecting in fiscal 2014, we \u2013 the revenues we\u2019re projecting for fiscal 2016 are a little bit above where we were -- for bulk lump sums are just a little bit above where they were for fiscal 2014. The outlier is that fiscal 2015, we had one of these big spikes up. We expect to continue to see that periodically. There will be years where there is just a lot of lump sum activity. In this last year, there were concerns with the new mortality table, the particular dynamics of where lump sum interest rates are versus the accounting interest rate. So those things can impact it, particular year-to-year basis. ", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay. Also I had a question on the exchange business. You\u2019re clearly hiring for greater demand and if you could get into sort of the dynamics of that with regards to breaking out the demand for December, I mean, January versus the rest of the year, because I think your comment with regards to sizing for fiscal year, but if you can break it out into first half versus second half?", "John Haley", "Well, I will let Roger talk a little bit about that in terms of some of the specifics there. But I guess what we just mentioned in the beginning, as I mentioned particularly, when you look at the retirees, we have 220,000 retirees we expect to enrol this year. That is an enormous gain over what we had last year and so it\u2019s going to require a big spike up in our capabilities. Now, one of the things that we\u2019ve been \u2013 we are pretty proud of is the fact that we\u2019ve been able to manage this growth and be able to plan for this kind of growth and do without having any hiccups with our clients. So that\u2019s one of the reasons, we have had great success in this market is we do have a good process about bringing people in and administering them sufficiently. ", "But Roger, you may want to talk about the specifics of the hiring. ", "Roger Millay", "I am not totally sure, Ashwin, I apologize exactly what you focused on. So I will just highlight, as John said, so the numbers were 220,000 incremental for retiree 1/1/16 versus 160,000 1/1/15. So that\u2019s going to spike up revenue obviously in the second half of the year quite a bit more than it was in the second half of fiscal 2015.", "For actives, it looks like we are running about twice the level that we were, may be not quite twice the level we were at this point for signups for 1/1/16. So we have good momentum, but as you say, it\u2019s focused on driving revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Got it. Just a clarification on that, should we assume that these projections do not include any changes you can effect in to the Willis channel once that acquisition or once that merger closes?", "John Haley", "Yes, that's correct.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay. Because those would be positive changes that you can do to compensation and such to drive behavior and demand, right?", "John Haley", "Yeah.", "Roger Millay", "But all these projections are done on a stand-alone basis.", "Ashwin Shirvaikar", "Okay, got it. Understood. Congratulations and all the best. Thank you.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks, Ashwin.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Ashwin.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Anderson of Shlomo. Your line is open.", "Q - Unidentified Analyst", "How are you doing? I\u2019m Ed [ph] for Shlomo here from Stifel. So, sorry guys. Just a question on the - -a little more detail on the -- you mentioned in Exchange business, the 1Q16 margin accelerated higher, could you maybe give us some color on exactly maybe a little bit more detail on what that impact is versus prior year?", "John Haley", "Yeah. So I mean what's really going on there again the peak ramp up season is the September and December quarters, as we add people for the retiree business and that just has a huge impact. So I think that's the real driver of the margin being 10% in the first half, first quarter.", "And it was that kind of mid-teens, I believe last year in the comparable quarter and so that's driven again by the large retiree annual enrolment period preparations and perhaps also a little bit by continuing ramping up of the active segment of the market.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks. And then in regards to, it's just maybe a qualitative question here and I'm sorry if you've answered this before at one point in time, but how big of a difference is there in the sales cycle between -- in the Exchange business between the large deals like with the RFPs and then maybe a smaller mid-size deals. I mean I'm trying to figure out the delta there may be and sales cycle, I don't know if you've ever commented on that before.", "John Haley", "I think the only comments we\u2019ve made have been really more around qualitative differences, not necessarily quantitative, but I can say this that the sales cycle in the big plants tends to be much longer than the mid-market plants. And they can expand several years at times. So it's just much longer.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thanks. And then one more if I can squeeze in, along those lines and I think you did allude to some commentary on the pipeline, but I'm just wondering maybe you could retouch over again on the pipeline for the large deals in \u201916, but then also in particular in \u201817, I just want to make sure I interpreted your comments correctly on \u201817, it's not like maybe you\u2019re inferring, it was a little bit lighter in \u201817 on the large RFP type deals and I know I realized it's early, but maybe you could comment a little further about that?", "Roger Millay", "No. Actually, here is what I was trying to say about that is that right now, we are seeing a -- and it\u2019s right, this is the very beginning of the 2017 activity, but we\u2019re seeing a somewhat higher proportion of large plants in the RFP activity that we saw at this time last year. But then I went on to say even though we are seeing a slightly higher percentage of large plants in the RFPs, a, it's very early, but b, even if this continued, we still think the midmarket is going to be the strong driver of growth in the short run.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thanks for that. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "George Tong", "Hi, thanks. Good morning.", "John Haley", "Good morning, George.", "George Tong", "Going into the Exchange, NOI margins have been furthered. Does the step down in margins at this quarter end and next quarter reflect only the accelerated pace of hiring or are there other structural changes in mix in the business or other factors that possibly alter your longer-term expectations for exchange margins?", "Roger Millay", "Yes. So first, George, it doesn't alter any long-term expectations. Again, the big drivers as you look at margins over the last several quarters and going into early next year, the biggest impact is the ramp up for the annual enrollment period for retiree and there could be a little bit as well in there on the active side but it\u2019s mainly retiree.", "George Tong", "Got it. And on the fiscal 2016 exchange selling season, how did the 100,000 employees that you finalized for enrollment compare with your expectations and can the number sustain at least low-to-mid 30s full-year exchange revenue growth next year?", "John Haley", "My comments first is that we\u2019re not talking about guidance for beyond fiscal \u201916 at this point. I mean, I think, we would say that there is a nice ramp up for what we see now for 116 for actives versus 115. I think that we\u2019re showing good momentum across the exchanges business and we\u2019re looking to continue that momentum but not giving specific guidance on beyond \u201916 at this point.", "Roger Millay", "I mean and I guess George, just maybe, just some \u2013 a couple of additional comments there. This was pretty good growth for us, we\u2019re pleased with that growth. We feel like we have a terrific product here that\u2019s well positioned. It probably depends more on how the market develops than on anything and as we\u2019ve seen this is a market that\u2019s susceptible to wide variations in projections as to how fast it\u2019s going to develop. But we continue to be convinced that this is a terrific long-term market and we expect to be a dominate player in it.", "George Tong", "Very helpful, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Dave Styblo", "Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I just want to -- I\u2019m still a little bit confused about the enrollment guidance, I want to make sure I got it down straight. So the 220,000 that is the growth that you\u2019re expecting from the December quarter to January or end of the March, is that right?", "Roger Millay", "We\u2019re going to enroll 220,000 retirees on January 1, 2016 that\u2019s essentially what that is.", "Dave Styblo", "Okay. I think that\u2019s considerably higher I think the last out of point you told us was about 160,000. So can you talk a little bit more about what changed there or what sort of, was that one customer or several customers rolling on with the nature of that growth?", "Roger Millay", "Well, the big bulk of the -- the big part of that growth of course is -- or higher state retirees and that\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know, 60% of that growth or more, two-thirds of the growth is probably due to that one case, of course we did have that case, we\u2019d announced that a long while ago, so we always knew this was going to be a very good season but it\u2019s turned out to be really a great one.", "Dave Styblo", "Okay. And then on the active side, I think I heard you say, 100,000 and then more than double that or about double that but again the anchor point for me wasn\u2019t quite clear, where you trying to reference the movement from December to January or a year-over-year comparison for the whole fiscal year, can you flush that out for us again.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, so what we were saying there is, we finalized sales for about a 100,000 eligible employees for the 2016, the full annual enrollment season for 2016. And then to put that in context, this year, this time last year, we had about 30,000 eligible employees, which were scheduled for this annual enrollment period leading up to January 1, 2016 but then we also did have one large off cycle which occurred in the spring of 2015. So if I add the large off cycle which is in the spring of 2015 to the 30,000 we had there, than we\u2019ve probably more than -- we\u2019ve probably about doubled.", "Dave Styblo", "Right, okay, I can see that. So, the margin profile as you guys are trying to ramp up the business obviously, you talked a little about the drag earlier on. How do you continue to see this play out over time, I know early on you thought it might look like segment margin profits consistent with that business but it\u2019s going to be I\u2019m sure having a lot of noise and investments early on. At what point, do you expect the margins to sort of stabilize out a little bit more and reach a more normalized run rate and ultimately, what do you think that those gets you now that we\u2019ve fast forwarded a few more months and quarters into the exchange movement here?", "John Haley", "Well, I think what we\u2019ve always said is that we\u2019re -- the margins we\u2019re projecting for the exchange business are about the same as the whole rest of the business. Now, people can make arguments that indeed if we can skip this business to really scale, they could be higher. Of course, we also think exchanges are a dynamic business and we may be continually making investments in them. So, we are in the projection of margins being about the same as for the rest of the business. We\u2019ve still never met an investment that we didn\u2019t like in this business and so, we\u2019re continuing to do that.", "So, we\u2019re not projecting anything more than that. We do recognize that particularly it\u2019s more sensitive to the retirees than to anything. The actives tend to be a more mechanized system but the retirees, we have to hire an enormous number of call center folks each year when we bring in a large new base of retirees. So, as long as we\u2019re continuing to grow and we get them, we\u2019re delighted about that. We\u2019ll take the fact that we have to invest in them for the long run profit that they generate. But we\u2019re looking forward to continue and grow the retirees for a number of years more.", "Dave Styblo", "Sure. I guess it doesn\u2019t surprise me because as you -- correct me, if I\u2019m wrong, but the first year that you bring somebody on, is it even accretive for a retiree because it\u2019s the labor-intensive and the cost of acquisition must be pretty high. So, let\u2019s bring those folks on a walk them through, signing up for the first time and then after that isn\u2019t a little bit more [indiscernible] from years two and beyond for the period that they\u2019re on there?", "John Haley", "That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s what happens. It\u2019s that -- that first year and it\u2019s really that first -- it\u2019s that quarter, although sometimes like we started ramping up earlier this year as Roger was saying, but it\u2019s the period leading up to January 1 when we have to train and we hire and train and certify all of our associates that are going to be helping the retirees to enroll and that\u2019s a labor-intensive business.", "Dave Styblo", "Okay. And then just the last one. So, moving over to the risk and financial services, I know you guys talked a little bit more of a stabilization and the teams are being flat to moderately up I think on a constant currency basis for the first quarter after declining several quarters, can you just elaborate and talk a little bit more about what might be either improving or at least getting less worse in the components of that business?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I think we\u2019ve been saying through a few quarters that it seems like the RFS business has stabilized either around breakeven in terms of growth or low levels of growth. There are elements of that segment, in the two lines of business in that segment, where we\u2019re seeing [Technical Difficulty] growth software side, in risk consulting and software, and in the delegated and fund side of investment but kind of core traditional more consulting-oriented business really isn\u2019t seeing any catalyst growth right now. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s behind the guidance for the first quarter. We expect them to be a little bit better than they were overall in fiscal \u201915, but we\u2019re not seeing anything at the moment that would drive big bump there.", "John Haley", "Yeah, I mean, I would just say also that we went through a restructuring with risk consulting and software the year before last and -- year and a half ago I guess, right, something like that, and I\u2019ve actually been extraordinarily pleased with the way that whole line of business has responded. As Roger mentioned, the margins were kept at a comparable basis and although the revenues did increase 1% here, I mean as we said, that\u2019s the EMEA region, which is a very big region for risk consulting and software had 14% growth for the prior year. So, that was quite a tough comparable. But I think we feel like the restructuring that we\u2019ve done there has really positioned us for good growth and good profitability going forward and we\u2019re very pleased with the performance.", "Dave Styblo", "Great, thanks. If I can squeeze in, sorry, one last one, so, initially you were talking about fiscal year EBITDA guidance sustainable around 20% and now I think you had mentioned around 21%, what's the change in improvement that you are seeing there to drive that level up a little bit?", "John Haley", "So, we did caution I remember for this last quarter, the quarter before that that after the very strong margin performance that we had in the first half of the year that we are kind of saying don't count on that. But as we looked at our momentum going into fiscal \u201816 and the revenue momentum continues to be good. I mentioned a little bit earlier that the bulk-lump sum activity is turning out to be a bit higher than we thought a quarter or two ago. So, overall, the activity that we've had to manage productivity in the company which has gone well in addition to now continuing solid revenue growth going into fiscal \u201816 gave us confidence that we were going to continue at that about 21% level.", "Dave Styblo", "Great. Thanks for the question.", "John Haley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is open", "Tim McHugh", "Thank you. I guess I just want to ask on the exchange business. You made the comment that you don\u2019t -- it's too early in the season to give guidance for the next fiscal year, but in the prior two years you\u2019ve given a number, so I guess what\u2019s different this year versus in the past?", "Roger Millay", "Hey, Tim, and maybe John will add some comment. I think you are referring to the fact that we said last year, either at this time or at the analyst day that we were targeting to have 1.2 million lives. And so that was the number at that time and while we are targeting, I think at this point this year we did have better visibility into some off-cycles. Last year John mentioned that we had a larger client that was coming in. I think it was April 1 as I recall.", "And then I think we also knew we had a larger retiree off-cycle in the second half of the year. I think we knew that at this point. So we felt like we had better visibility last year and we are probably also a little bit more tuned right now to what the kind of actual cycle of knowing what\u2019s coming in in the broker channel and the smaller and mid-sized active. So we don't have the visibility now. We have visibility to the sales season and what\u2019s going on for 1/1/16.", "Tim McHugh", "Okay. And can you give a sense, the 320,000 active, can you directionally help us with how much of that is Liazon versus I guess the jumbo market at this point?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I mean as we\u2019ve said I think in prior quarters, we really don't have that breakdown because we do have \u2013 we used Liazon for both direct, sub-directed direct business as well as the broker channel. And so we view the channel as kind of fungible, so I don't have a number here and I don't think we're really providing that breakdown going forward.", "Tim McHugh", "Okay. And then I guess on the \u2013 I guess, you got asked on the exchange margin I guess about kind of long-term do you still -- what you think, but I guess just the math on the profitability of the retiree exchange that you gave, it implies that you're probably losing money and I guess the prior few quarters implied the same thing on the active exchange at this point. Can you talk about when you would expect that piece just to become profitable versus really the long-term target margin, but just when would it move from losing money to being profitable as you look forward?", "John Haley", "Yeah, I will just say that from my point of view, we are still anticipating a ramp up in that business and we are investing consistent with that. We don't have a specific target out there at this point, but certainly we will respond with our investment based on the top line volumes that we see. So we are \u201cinvesting\u201d. We are showing losses in the active business now and you can see that very clearly, it's pulling the margin of the business down. But we certainly target as that business ramps up and towards the kinds of projections that are out there, that will head to breakeven in that period and towards the profit levels that John talked about.", "Tim McHugh", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Mark Marcon", "Good morning and thanks for taking my question. My first set of questions relates to the Exchange Solutions business and then I have a broader strategic question. With regards to Exchange Solutions, in this past quarter, can you give us a sense for how Acclaris ended up impacting the margin and how it will impact the margin in the first quarter?", "John Haley", "Yes. I think of course, it's quite small and it came in during the quarter. As I recall, there is a few million of revenue and maybe no real impact to adjusted diluted EPS. I think there was a little bit of positive NOI as I recall, but small numbers.", "Mark Marcon", "Okay. And then with regards to the broker channel, any feedback at all from your non-Willis brokers in terms of their participation going forward, any sort of tone that you\u2019ve heard there?", "John Haley", "It's very early obviously, Mark, here, I mean we have a large number of regional brokers and we don't think there is really any impact from this deal for them. With some of the larger ones, we\u2019re in discussions and we don't -- we\u2019ll just see how that -- there is nothing to report at the moment.", "Mark Marcon", "Okay. And then with regards to the 100,000 active that are in the pipeline, can you indicate what percentage of those might be from larger companies, say more than 1000 or I mean more than 10,000 employees. I'm not expecting you to name any brands, but are there any name brand companies in there?", "John Haley", "Well, there are certainly companies whose names you would recognize and I characterize it as there are a few above that 10,000 cut-off, but the volume is more kind of small and midmarket business.", "Mark Marcon", "So kind of developing the way you expect it, where basically the small mediums are showing the faster adoption, but you are getting a higher number of large companies as well. Is that fair?", "John Haley", "Yeah. I think that's fair.", "Mark Marcon", "Okay, great. And then a larger strategic question, and I ask this with all respect because I recognize that I don't know anywhere close to what you know about the insurance business and the insurance brokerage business, but are there any sort of developments that could occur at Willis, whether it\u2019s turnover, whether it\u2019s softening in the P&C market, whether it\u2019s alternative investment displacement, any sort of developments that would cause you to have any sort of second thoughts with regards to proceeding with the acquisition or maybe adjusting what the exchange rate is?", "John Haley", "So, I think generally, this is really a call to talk about our results and our guidance here and so we really don't want to get into anything with the Willis merger that we have there. But I will say, we've sort of put something in the script just to comment on this. We are very much looking forward to this merger. We think it's a good thing and we remain committed to it.", "Mark Marcon", "Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Haley for closing remarks.", "John Haley", "Okay, thank you very much everyone for joining us this morning and just one final note. We\u2019re not going to be having an Analyst Day this year due to the pending merger with Willis, but we do look forward to reviewing our first quarter results with you in November. So long and thanks for joining us.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

Ma'am, you may begin.", "Aida Sukys", "Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Willis Towers Watson earnings call.

After our prepared remarks, we'll open the conference call for your questions.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone. Today, we'll review our results for the first quarter of 2016 and provide some guidance for the full year of 2016. We'll provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results for this quarter. Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the legacy Willis and Towers Watson structure. We anticipate providing consolidated segment results for the second quarter of 2016 during our August earnings call.", "Before we review our first quarter 2016 results, I'd like to say how pleased I am to see the focus and excitement our colleagues have brought to the marketplace and the collaboration that's taking place at all levels of the organization.", "I want to thank all of our colleagues for the spirit they've shown to-date and all of the hard work that's keeping us on point for achieving our long-term goals. We're pleased with how we performed this quarter. Reported revenues for the quarter were $2.2 billion, which includes $53 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis.", "Despite the currency headwinds, adjusted revenues, which include $32 million of deferred revenues, were up 16% on a constant currency basis and 1% on an organic basis. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $671 million or 29.6% of adjusted revenues. The prior year first quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $579 million or 28.8%. The growth in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to the acquisitions of Miller and Gras Savoye. Miller and Gras Savoye produced most of the profits in the first half of the calendar year.", "Income from operations for the quarter was $326 million or 15% of revenue. The prior year first quarter pro forma operating income was $369 million or 18%. Adjusted income from operations for the quarter was $646 million or 28.5% of adjusted revenues, and for the prior year quarter, was $540 million or 26.8% on a pro forma basis. For the quarter, earnings per diluted share were $1.75 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.41. Roger will address the adjusted EPS in more detail later in the call.", "I'd also like to provide an update on three areas of integration, revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First, let's discuss the revenue synergies. We recently updated our revenue tracking tools and plan to have more detailed revenue synergy updates by the third quarter. However, as I travel to the various offices and see firsthand the collaborative sales efforts and hear about our market success, it's clear our colleagues are not waiting for a top-down integration mandate or reporting tools to go-to-market.", "We're making very good inroads in the three areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications, global healthcare solutions, the mid-market healthcare exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another three global healthcare solution clients and the pipeline looks very strong.", "Turning to the mid-market exchange opportunities, we've won nine new clients for the 2017 enrollment season and continue to see the pipeline build. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we were awarded all the P&C lines for a multi-billion dollar construction organization.", "We're also seeing some success in areas we didn't fully appreciate prior to the merger. As an example, we were recently awarded the global P&C business for a large multi-national based outside of the U.S. The sales team incorporated the knowledge of the company from both legacy organizations, so then we could tailor a solution that was in alignment with the client's needs.", "The client noted that our strong collaboration and the depth of our analytical capabilities set us apart from the competition and help us look at the prevailing risk and data issues from a very new and different perspective.", "Within just four weeks of bringing Willis Towers Watson together, we were able to come together as a single global team and radically changed the way the client viewed Willis Towers Watson.", "We also experienced a win recently with a French multinational in an area where we have no formal revenue synergy targets. Gras Savoye had a long-standing relationship with this client in healthcare, and property and casualty. Joining forces with the Gras Savoye relationship team was a team of talent and reward consultants, who were hired for pay grading project. This is a great example of a full array of services we can now provide our clients.", "While these early wins may not have a significant and immediate financial impact, we're very pleased with the progress we've made towards our revenue synergies. These wins are further proof of the strong cultural alignment in the merged organizations and perhaps most importantly, these wins demonstrate that when we put client needs first and help them succeed, we will succeed. Seeing the overall level of sales activity we've had to date, I'm more confident than ever about our achieving our 2018 revenue synergy objectives.", "Now, moving to the cost and tax synergies. We announced post-merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million and tax savings of approximately $75 million annually, with these objectives achievable over a three-year post-merger integration period. We budgeted $20 million in cost synergies for 2016 with an expected run rate of approximately $30 million of annualized savings and fully expect to meet our overall savings objectives by the end of 2018. We should ultimately exceed our tax goal of $75 million of annual tax savings.", "As a side note, regarding the recently-issued Treasury rules, our outside advisers and tax group reviewed the Treasury regulations thoroughly and we feel confident these regulations will not impact our current or longer-term tax savings. I'd also like to address the legacy Willis operational improvement program or now what we'll refer to as the OIP. We continue to see this program as an important factor in achieving our 25% adjusted EBITDA margin objective by the end of 2018. We'll continue to provide color on the program and highlight savings, but we'll focus on the margin impact rather than the spread between revenue and expense growth.", "Incremental savings from the OIP were approximately $94 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. The momentum of continuing savings will be sustained throughout the year. We continue to be committed to saving $325 million by the end of 2017. This quarter, we incurred about $25 million of restructuring costs and overall will spend approximately $140 million in 2016. This program continues to be on track to meet all of its financial objectives.", "One significant step taking place this month is the restructuring of mid and back-office colleagues in Great Britain. As a reminder, much of the program is focused on streamlining processes and moving office and administrative functions to lower-cost locations.", "Great Britain was one of the first regions to adopt the OIP and now entering the last phase of the project. They're on track to obtain their saving goals on schedule and on budget. We continue to believe that the majority of the company OIP savings will drop to the bottom line and we're driving internal accountabilities to ensure that happens. We will have more detailed information on margin impact during our Analyst Day in September.", "Now, I'll review the first quarter 2016 legacy Towers Watson segment results and outlook and Roger will provide the legacy Willis results and provide updated 2016 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. As we discuss segment margins or operating margins, please note the metrics include different items for each of the legacy companies.", "The Willis margins include amortization, cash incentives and some of the restructuring costs, whereas Towers Watson margins exclude amortization of intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition costs and discretionary compensation.", "Now, let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of legacy Towers Watson segments. On an overall constant currency basis, revenues in Benefits increased 1%, Exchange Solutions increased 57%, Risk and Financial Services decreased 4% and Talent and Rewards decreased 9%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance will reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. So, let's look at each segment in more depth starting with Benefits.", "For the quarter, the Benefits segment had revenues of $486 million, which represents a 1% increase as compared to a 5% pro forma revenue increase in the first quarter of 2015. Retirement revenues decreased by 2%, Health and Group Benefits revenues grew by 8%, and Technology and Administration Solution revenues were up 8%.", "We don't anticipate any special demand for actuarial consulting services in 2016. Demand is expected to be good for healthcare consulting and technology and administration is expected to go live with many client implementations throughout the year, which will drive additional revenues. We expect Benefits 2016 revenue growth will be in the low-single-digit range. Benefits had an NOI margin of 36%, and we continue to expect this segment to be in the mid-30% range for calendar 2016.", "Exchange Solutions had an outstanding quarter with revenues of $152 million, a pro forma increase of 57%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions segment grew by 48%. Driven by record enrollments, our Retiree and Access Exchange revenues increased 47%, and the Other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 73% and 49% on an organic basis.", "Increased enrollments and new client revenues drove the revenue increases. Our consumer-directed accounts practice also contributed approximately $9 million in revenue this quarter. We believe the increase in lives will continue to support good growth for the rest of 2016, but we don't expect much off-cycle work during the calendar year.", "We have increased revenue growth expectations from low to mid-20% to a high 20% range for calendar year 2016. Exchange Solutions had a 30% NOI margin as compared to 21% in last year's first quarter. The Retiree and Access Exchanges line of business led the segment with a 48% NOI margin. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the high teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year.", "For the quarter, Risk and Financial Services had revenues of $144 million, a pro forma decline of 4%. Risk Consulting and Software revenues decreased 5% due to a softness in EMEA life consulting and a general softness in demand in the Americas. Investment revenue decreased by 2%, primarily driven by revenue declines in EMEA as demand softened for advisory services. The Risk and Financial Services segment is expected to have low-single-digit revenue growth for calendar year 2016.", "We recently invested in senior marketing staff, and the pipeline appears to be greater than at this point last year. We anticipate the impact of our marketing investments to impact revenues in the second half of the year. In addition, the prior-year comparables for investment aren't as tough. Risk and Financial Services had a 23% NOI margin, and we expect to manage the business to achieve mid-20% margins.", "Now, let's move on to Talent and Rewards, which had revenues of $124 million, down 9% on a pro forma constant currency basis and down 6% on a pro forma organic basis as compared to the prior-year quarter, which experienced 15% revenue growth. Executive Compensation revenues were down 1% as compared to 11% growth in the first quarter of calendar year 2015. Data surveys and technology revenues decreased by 15%. We saw a 4% decline on an organic basis as compared to a strong comparable of 9% revenue growth in the first quarter of calendar year 2015. As a reminder, we acquired Saville consulting and sold our HR Service Delivery business.", "Rewards, Talent and Communication revenues decreased 9% as compared to 23% growth in the first quarter of calendar year 2015. Talent and Rewards had a 10% NOI margin for the quarter. The first half of the calendar year is generally soft for this segment. We see an overall decrease in the number of transactions in the market globally, and as a result, we anticipate this impacting the segment's top-line results. Given that, we're lowering our revenue outlook from a mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth to a low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 with margins in the mid-20% range.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to first reiterate John's comment on the great collaboration we're experiencing in Willis Towers Watson. The level of engagement I've seen from the operating committee members to colleagues around the globe has been tremendous. It really is an exciting time to be part of Willis Towers Watson, and based on the foundation being created now, I look forward to a very successful future.", "Before moving to the performance of the legacy Willis segments, I'd like to add more color around John's comments regarding the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter. I'd also like to discuss a couple of noteworthy adjustments to earnings, which were highlighted in the press release today.", "There were two significant positive impacts to adjusted diluted earnings per share. First, our adjusted tax rate came in at 19%, which was lower than our forecast due to the seasonal strength of our profitability this quarter. We expect higher tax rates in the coming quarters, particularly in those quarters with seasonally lower operating profit.", "Second, our outstanding weighted average diluted share count came in lower than expected due to the merger closing four days into the quarter. This lowered our average diluted share count to approximately 136 million; the current outstanding diluted shares are approximately 138 million.", "Now, let me turn to the reconciliation of segment operating income to income from operations, which was highlighted in our press release this morning. Most of these adjustments are self-explanatory, but I thought there were two items which perhaps needed some additional explanation.", "First, amortization of $126 million represents the intangibles amortization, which is excluded from the legacy Towers Watson segment results. In addition to this, there is $35 million of amortization expense reported in the legacy Willis segment results. The reporting treatment will be uniform next quarter when we report on the consolidated Willis Towers Watson segments.", "Second, as we've described in public filings, relevant parties have agreed in principle to settle the Stanford litigation for $120 million and seek a court-issued bar order against all Stanford-related claims. We recorded a $70 million provision in the December quarter based on the facts and circumstances at the time. The balance of $50 million was recorded in the first quarter once the settlement amount and terms were agreed. The settlement will need final court approval which, if granted, may take several quarters. This is still ongoing litigation, so we're not able to provide more detail beyond what we've already said in our public filings.", "Now, let me turn to the legacy Willis segment performance. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees, or C&F for International increased by 84%; North America increased 3%; Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance increased by 14%; and Great Britain was flat. All of the C&F results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. Now, let's look at each of the legacy Willis segments in more depth.", "Turning to Willis International. With the consolidation of Gras Savoye, which contributed $235 million to revenue in the quarter, the top line grew 84% from the prior year. Gras Savoye's contribution for the quarter was a bit ahead of plan. On an organic basis, International C&F declined by 5%. This was driven by weakness in Asia and a cancellation adjustment for a large national resources project. This cancellation was not related to the economic environment of the energy sector, but was political in nature. We continued to see strong growth in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. The segment's operating profit margin was 30% this quarter. Our outlook for organic C&F growth for the full year is in the mid-single-digit range with net operating margin in the low- to mid-teens range.", "Willis North America had a nice start to the year with organic C&F growth of 4%. The segment saw strength in all of its core regions across a number of lines of business, most notably construction, financial institutions and FINEX despite modest pricing headwinds.", "The Human Capital Practice also contributed mid-single-digit organic growth during the quarter. The segment's operating margin of 23% was modestly ahead of our expectations and highlights some of the strategic changes we've been making related to the operational improvement program. The outlook for Willis North America organic C&F growth continues to be in the low- to mid-single digits with a margin in the high teens.", "Now turning to Willis Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance. CW&R generated commissions and fees growth of 14%, driven primarily by the contributions of Miller Insurance Services, which contributed $49 million of C&F in the quarter.", "Organic C&F declined 3%, primarily due to the year-over-year decline of our Fine Arts and Jewelry business as a result of the departure of the team of associates to JLT, for which we recently settled litigation as well as a strong comparable in the reinsurance business which benefited last year by an uplift of $6.5 million on a restructured account. CWR's operating margin was 46% as this segment's business is seasonally weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect reported growth to be in the low double digits, as Miller fully rolls on through the first half of the year.", "Organic C&F growth is expected to be in the low-single-digit range in 2016, assuming we don't see any significant further deterioration of reinsurance rates. I should note that in our growth guidance for CWR on a commission and fees basis is lower than the total revenues guidance we provided previously. This results from the fact that the earlier guidance included the anticipated impact of the $40 million settlement with JLT, which will be recognized in the second quarter as other income in total revenues. This item will not be adjusted out of GAAP earnings consistent with the historic practice. We expect operating margin to be in the low 20% range.", "Finally, Willis GB C&F growth was flat for the quarter. The cancellation adjustment for the large natural resources project mentioned earlier also impacted Willis GB. Organic C&F declined 2%. Excluding the impact of the natural resources project, organic growth would have been up approximately 2%. The segment's reported operating margin was 14%, modestly lower as compared to the prior year, driven by the project-related revenue decline and some one-time expense adjustments.", "We continue to have a positive outlook for the business and these one-time revenue and expense events which occurred this quarter are not indicative of our future outlook. Our outlook for organic C&F growth is in the low single-digit range with margin in the high 20% range.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. We issued $1 billion of U.S. dollar notes in March, $450 million at 3.5% with a maturity date of September 2021 and $550 million at 4.4% with a maturity date of March 2026. We expect to go to the euro market for an additional $600 million to $800 million. Being in the market recently and finalizing the timing of our refinancing, we expect our interest charges to be approximately $200 million for the year 2016.", "The proceeds from the dollar offering were used to repay our $300 million public note which matured in March, repay the $400 million U.S. dollar tranche of our one-year bank note and reduce the outstanding balance in our revolving credit facility.", "Let me turn now to capital allocation. As we mentioned during the last earnings call, we expect to have a capital allocation approach focused on flexibility while maintaining an investment-grade rated balance sheet. On a Moody's basis, this equates to a threshold of approximately 3.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. Currently, our Moody's debt-to-EBITDA ratio is around 3.7 times. We expect this to self-correct over the next several quarters as our restructuring expenses decline, merger-related cost reduction programs are implemented and profits increase.", "We believe we have several hundred million dollars of capital allocation flexibility for the second half of the year. As always, we will weigh the benefit of potential acquisitions versus repurchasing shares. We prefer to do good acquisitions and after that look to share buybacks, consistent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns.", "Free cash flow was $70 million this quarter. Free cash flow is expected to generally improve through each consecutive quarter during the calendar year. This quarter we've paid approximately $500 million in incentive compensation which included the normal pay cycle for former Willis colleagues and a partial year bonus for former Towers Watson associates. Additionally, we contributed approximately $40 million to our defined benefit pension plans.", "Now let's review our guidance for fiscal 2016. We'll continue to incur various merger and integration related costs. These costs will continue to be material as we work through the integration period and we expect them to be in approximately the $150 million to $170 million \u2013 I'm sorry, $175 million range for 2016. The level of spending will depend on how quickly we move through some of the integration activities.", "Both deferred revenues and transaction integration related costs will be adjusted from our GAAP measures. In fiscal 2016, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the low double-digits with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions. For purposes of segment guidance, we'll use commissions and fees which excludes other revenue. As noted previously, a legal settlement of approximately $40 million will be posted to other income in the second quarter.", "As we guide to overall company performance, we'll use total revenues which includes fees and commissions and other revenues. We continue to expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digits, but based on the first quarter results, our expectations are a bit muted versus the beginning of the year.", "Adjusted operating income margin is anticipated to be around 20%, an increase from our previous guidance of around 19.5%. In calendar 2015, adjusted operating income was 19.1%.The adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 24% range. The current GAAP rate of approximately 7% is due to a number of factors, but the main driver is related to the valuation of intangibles as a result of purchase accounting. The amortization of the intangibles is somewhat front end loaded and the current GAAP rate will not be sustained over time.", "We continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $7.70 to $7.95 based on average currency rates of $1.43 to the pound and $1.10 to the euro. While we've maintained our overall revenue growth projections, the first quarter has dampened the range of this growth. Our leadership team is aligned and committed to manage expenses as needed to achieve our 2016 adjusted EPS goal.", "Once again, we have many moving pieces related to the merger and integration, but I'm extremely pleased with how things are progressing. Our intent is to continue to streamline reporting over the next several quarters and provide a clear line of sight to our operations and results.", "Now I'll turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Roger. And now we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Ryan Tunis", "Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess just taking a step back, I mean your comment that your view on organic over the full year is a bit muted based on what you saw in the first quarter, just hoping you could talk a little bit about the areas looking out over the rest of the year, where your expectations may be a little bit muted relative to where they were.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. I mean, certainly, as you look across the legacy segments of both firms, there were areas that came in a little bit softer and I think the legacy Towers Watson RFS segment is one of those pieces. As we mentioned, the Talent and Rewards business came in softer than we expected, and we're not seeing the kind of project activity that we saw there last year. And then International within legacy Willis and the CWR segment is a little bit softer. So I think those are all the areas that we're a little bit off where we expected. We do think that some of the elements there are timing in nature, so perhaps you might look at our guidance and be surprised that we're not a little bit more muted.", "But we think that in Asia, we mentioned Asia and International, there were some deals that didn't come in, in the first quarter, but we see them coming in later in the year. And also, as I mentioned, there were, in a couple segments, there were some tougher comparables that don't repeat later in the year. So we think a little bit muted is the way to look at it.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay. Thanks. And I just had a follow-up on the treasury action and the tax guidance. We saw the press release reiterating the $75 mill. I mean it seems like the \u2013 I also appreciate it's not really an inversion, but of the $75 mill, should we think about that predominantly coming from inter-company debt, or are there other \u2013 to what extent's the $75 mill dependent on the inter-company interest versus other forms of tax planning and just redomestication?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. I think, broadly, we were focused on efficiency of capital structure and efficiency of inter-company arrangements as we structure the legal entity setup for the merger. We do have inter-company debt there of course, and that is one of the elements that drives our tax efficiencies. And we're mindful of other opportunities and continue to work on it. So \u2013 and I think as we mentioned in our press release and discussion a month or two ago, given that our merger was closed in January and the new treasury regulations came out in April, we're very comfortable with the sustainability of our structure and the tax synergies that we mentioned.", "Ryan Tunis", "Thanks for the answers.", "Roger Millay", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Thanks so much. I guess just a follow-up on Ryan's question in a second on the regs. But just looking at overall organic, we can focus more on Willis for the moment. In margins, when I look at peers, margins are in the mid 20%s, organic growth has been running, you know, 3%, 4% here recently, so your organic was negative adjusting for items or flattish. Margins sound like you're kind of \u2013 if we take the International and North America, in the aggregate, looks like you're looking at mid-teens margins. Why is that? Because I would guess \u2013 obviously, those margins that you're talking about are excluding the operational improvement program and other adjustments. What is that delta and how should we think about what Willis can do to try and close that gap?", "Roger Millay", "Well, thanks, Michael. Look, I think this goes back to the overall merger strategy and setup and what we're implementing. I can't really comment on the margin gap that you just articulated, but it doesn't sound all that dissimilar to what we were thinking about when we set the 25% EBITDA margin target for the overall company.", "We think there's opportunity there. We think that OIP is clearly a great asset to have as we move towards that target, and is producing real results. So we do think as you look at some comparables that there's opportunity to enhance margin, and we're on the case. So I think that's the margin piece.", "I would say broadly, and maybe John wants to comment on this a little bit relative to our past experience, but when you look at the growth results here versus other players in the market, first, legacy Willis was moving the last couple years organically in that 3% to 4% range. There were some headwinds this quarter. Some of those were again timing in nature, including the pipeline adjustment that we talked about which was probably worth about 0.5 point of growth.", "So I think you consider the overall merger activity and you look at comparables and I think, again, we're confident in improved growth, organic growth as we go through the year, and while \u2013 again, a little bit muted, we think we're in an okay place here as we start the year.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Okay; fine. That's helpful. I mean I guess when you --", "John Haley", "Yeah, Roger, I guess I would just \u2013 maybe just to follow-up just a little bit of what Roger said. When we look back as to where Willis had been over the last three years against our main competitor, Willis grew \u2013 the revenue growth was actually higher than our main competitors. We've outlined what we think are some of the specifics for why the growth was somewhat off this quarter, but we don't expect those to be continuing issues.", "Michael Nannizzi", "I see. I guess, I mean, I guess my question is sort of looking at sort of the base broker model and \u2013 I mean organic growth is certainly an ingredient for sustainable margin expansion. And so kind of looking at where you are now and given the growth just sort of worked against you and maybe the merger, some of the elements of the merger will ultimately sort of resolve themselves, but maybe there's a period of transition between.", "I'm just trying to figure out how is that \u2013 and I get the overall EBITDA margins, but if I just look at International and North America which is comparable to the way others report sort of the brokerage or risk business, what is that gap and sort of who's the person, the enabler that's going to kind of drive the direction of that margin back towards that sort of peer group?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I mean, I guess I'll comment first. Look, I think that we're very committed to and very focused on our integration activities, completing the OIP program and driving to the 25% margin, and we believe that, that 25% margin is in the range of what we see competitors achieve. The team, the operating team and our overall leadership is aligned around that goal. So we will drive towards that goal through our businesses and through our operating leaders. And so I think, I mean I'm not sure exactly what you're getting at in your question, but I think it's the alignment. Again, it's observing what others can do in our market and the alignment with our business leaders that's going to achieve success here.", "Michael Nannizzi", "I'm not \u2013 I'm just asking. My question was just simply to not \u2013 it's just straightforward. It's just sort of looking at sort of where others with similar platforms are on a margin basis and sort of looking \u2013 so have you guys been trying to understand how we get from point A to point B, that's all. That was my own question. Okay. And then, as far as \u2013 just real quick on the amortization, Roger, you mentioned the Willis be \u2013 so should we then assume that starting in the second quarter, the amortization charge within Willis, that 35 million or the equivalent of that number in subsequent quarters, will be excluded from the operating income number? Is that kind of what you were implying?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. That's exactly right. And again, I'll say I guess we feel your pain relative to the differences between the two legacy companies, so that's why we pointed out those numbers as we now move in the second quarter to the new segments and the way we'll talk about them on a consistent basis. All amortization of intangibles will be excluded from adjusted operating earnings. So exactly what you said. And we think that will provide much greater clarity year-to-year. You won't have that M&A impact of intangibles interfering with the clarity of how operating margins are moving. So...", "Michael Nannizzi", "Got it, great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Your line is open.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. John, one of the rationales for the merger was improving the Exchange Solutions trajectory, trajectory improved dramatically actually in the quarter from expectations. Could you talk a little bit more, was it participants that came in better, are you selling more services per client, what's going on over there?", "John Haley", "Yeah. So thanks, Shlomo. I think generally all things around Exchange Solutions were really looking pretty positive there. We did benefit from the biggest retiree client we'd ever implemented, and so that added a lot of lives. But we have now as of the middle of last year, we had \u2013 we were up to a little close to 1.2 million, just under 1.2 million of total covered lives, from you know 730,000 the year before. We'll be growing that again this year. So the lives are going up everywhere. We are seeing \u2013 we're beginning to see some of the increased selling in the midmarket that we had expected. It's still early days for that. And I mean I think when I went through the different revenue synergies I acknowledged, we're seeing these things for the Exchange Solutions and for some of the others, but it's still really early.", "I mean most of those revenue synergies, we will see them in the back half of the three years, not in the end. I think the important thing from my viewpoint though is how quickly we're starting to at least see some of them come in and it's very encouraging for the long-term trend. I think \u2013 so it was really a confluence of different things, but on Exchange Solutions, we're delighted with just the growth in the retirees, in the actives and really across the board there.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Are you going to give us some forecast for this year or are we going to get that in June? I mean historically last few years you've been giving that for \u2013 when it was just Towers Watson.", "John Haley", "Yeah. Generally, we've been doing that. We'll probably do that Analyst Day is really when we're going to have some good numbers, Shlomo. That's what it's been the last year or two. And the problem as you know is that the selling season of course for the middle market runs throughout the year pretty much. But the larger part of the middle market and the large market, it's not over till really June or July or sometime there. So it's a while before we have really good information.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Okay. And then can you give a little bit more detail on the political item that resulted to large cancellation impacted both two units in Willis, how much was that in itself a factor of muting the growth? And I'm not sure if there's anything that you feel comfortable elaborating on that to get us a little more comfortable we're not going to see a recurrence of that.", "John Haley", "So let me just say this about that. As Roger said, it was \u2013 it probably knocked about a 0.5% off the growth rate. It was something -- it was sort of a one-time event that caused this we think, but we don't necessarily -- this is the kind of thing that we might even see this reversed in the remainder of the year. And so we're not banking on that, but that's not impossible.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Okay.", "Roger Millay", "It was about $10 million, Shlomo. So...", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "In total for both units?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, split 50/50 too.", "John Haley", "Yeah.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "And then for the whole year, the impact would be expected to be $40 million?", "Roger Millay", "No, no, no. That \u2013 this is a separate matter.", "John Haley", "No, no. It's a one-time $10 million comp, no.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. That \u2013 yeah.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "One-time $10 million. So it's 0.5% of...", "John Haley", "I mean that's the $10 million for the whole year, yes.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Okay. So the muted growth for the year is not specifically from \u2013 inordinate amount from this one contract?", "John Haley", "I think the muted growth is really a reflection of an overall mosaic of what's going on, and I think what Roger I think was trying to paint is a picture that looks like this, we have some specific items that we can see that caused some issues here and like the pipeline and so we see that. Whether \u2013 even if it doesn't come back, it's not going to be a repeat during the rest of the year, so we're sort of past that in some respects there. When we look at it, and you saw particularly when I was going through the legacy Towers Watson, we had some very tough comparables from a year ago. You saw a little bit of that when Roger was going through the legacy Willis things. The comparables get easier as we go through the year. So we're not saying that everything is going to pick up exactly to where it might have been. But overall, we're not feeling that downbeat about the growth. We think it'll be a little bit lower than we thought going into the year, but we're not \u2013 we're \u2013 it's not necessarily that far off.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "If you don't mind, just can you bridge for us what gets better in the second half? Because we're going from 1% growth to mid-single-digits which most people would think is 4% for the whole year or above. What gets a lot better? Is it just the comps get that much easier, and therefore, we have a lot better comps or is there something else in the numbers that are going to get better?", "John Haley", "I think partly the comps get better. I mean I think if you look at some of the \u2013 let me just give you one example. If you look at some of the bulk lump sum work that was very heavy in the first quarter of calendar 2015 and faded off somewhat in the remainder of the year.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. I mean maybe, Shlomo, just a few other things that we might have mentioned, I think we're \u2013 we think that investment will do better the rest of the year than it did in the first quarter just based on the pipeline that we see. One of the things that I think we alluded to, we haven't really discussed in the Q&A here is the impact in Talent and Rewards of the sale of the human resource service delivery business, so we'll lap that at some point this year.", "Talent and Rewards, I think the headline numbers make it look worse this quarter than it really is. And there \u2013 I guess John said, there are some tough comparables from projects they had going on at this time last year that we won't repeat. And then you do have again some of the timing things we mentioned before. So I think again we've gone through each of the business lines, looked at them closely and we do think that this kind of muted view of mid-single-digit organic growth is really what our momentum reflects at this point.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Okay. Thank you very much, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dave Styblo of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "David Styblo", "Hi there. Good morning and thanks for the questions. Maybe I'll move off organic growth for a minute and just talk a little bit more about EBITDA which I think did come in pretty strong, both on a dollar basis and the margin side. So can you maybe flesh out a little bit of what happened in there, what sort of cost synergies and why you're able to sort of keep a higher EBITDA despite the top line being a little bit more challenging right now? And then maybe how do we think about that trajectory going forward?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. I mean I think, again the trajectory that we expect from an EBITDA margin point of view and I won't say necessarily every quarter, but given our focus, we expect gradually improving EBITDA margins. For this quarter particularly, one thing, and we mentioned it just briefly in the script that was a little bit stronger than our forecast and led to some of the margin enhancement again versus what we expected is Gras Savoye came in stronger in the first quarter than expected. Some of that was just due to some revenue accounting comparability between the two firms. So we haven't changed our view on the full year for Gras Savoye, and they're coming in nicely. But it did give some acceleration into the first quarter.", "I think otherwise, OIP savings are flowing in. I think the team was attentive and you might recall if you follow both the legacy companies, there was cost activity going on as we entered the merger in both companies. And we're seeing a benefit of that, so I think otherwise there's disciplined operating activity going on.", "I mean we did mention again and it is unfortunate with the project cancellation that we mentioned earlier, but when you look at the two parts of legacy Willis that were furthest advanced in the OIP program, both North America and GB are seeing a benefit now in their margins of OIP. Unfortunately in GB, because of the cancellation, it's not as visible as it otherwise would have been.", "David Styblo", "Okay. And maybe...", "John Haley", "And, Roger, just I guess the other \u2013 and to make sure we're clear about this that the \u2013 quarter one and quarter two to a lesser extent are seasonally strong for EBITDA, so \u2013 and for margins, and that's true in a lot of the legacy Willis segments. It's certainly true in the Exchange Solutions, which is quite heavily weighted that way. So, while we expect to have strong margin performance throughout the year, the strongest part of it is this first quarter and to a lesser extent the second quarter.", "David Styblo", "Sure. Okay. Maybe you can also talk about the OIP and are you sticking to sort of the gross savings target that was originally out there? I think it was $150 million \u2013 excuse me, $150 million for this year. If that's the holding, can you tell us what you expect the net savings to be because I think thus far sort of on the legacy Willis side we've seen the growth savings come, but a lot of it was being put back in. So I'm wondering when the inflection point comes where shareholders get a chance to see more of the return of those growth savings hit the bottom line.", "John Haley", "Yeah. So I think \u2013 look, the OIP is one of the single most important things we're focusing on right now is to make sure that those savings do indeed drop to the bottom line. And it's a \u2013 it's one of the major focuses of the operating committee, is to make sure that we see those go through. And we're going to be looking very, very carefully at any reinvestment and try to maximize the amount that drops through. We'll probably \u2013 I think I mentioned earlier, we'll be able to give you more color around that as \u2013 at the Analyst Day in September. But that is one of the two or three major focuses of the organization at this point.", "David Styblo", "Okay. And then, lastly, maybe getting back to your capital deployment plans, I know there was sort of a commitment to start to repurchase shares in the second half of this year. It sounds like maybe a little bit more balanced of keeping some dry powder for M&A. Can you talk about what sort of you expect your share repurchases to look like? I don't think at this point you have an authorization, so maybe you could remind me about that. And also, if you want to touch upon the free cash flow outlook, I think we were hoping to get a little bit more visibility on that as you think about things with the \u2013 not only for this year but going forward over the next couple of years as those one-time expenses roll off and what you think your underlying free cash flow power can be in a couple of years.", "John Haley", "Yeah. Okay. So thanks very much. Let me just start off addressing that. So, look, when we \u2013 we didn't mean to signal any change from anything we've said before. What Roger was saying is we expect to have a few hundred million dollars available in the second half of the year which is I think always what we had talked about. This formulation that we said that what we want to do is maximize shareholder return. Generally, if we can find a very attractive acquisition, that's the \u2013 that's probably the way we could do that best, and we would \u2013 we're always looking to do that.", "But as a practical matter, there's no way we're going to do any kind of really major acquisition in the first year or year-and-a-half of this merger. We have work to do there, even a more modest acquisition. If there was something that was a unique property that if we didn't buy it now there wouldn't be an opportunity to buy one like that in the future, we might consider something like that. But in general, we're going to have higher standards for doing any acquisitions.", "But our overall approach has always been acquisitions are first, but we have some high standards for doing that. So it's hard to find them. And then after that, we want to return the cash to shareholders. I think the \u2013 our free cash flow is going to be the major source of how we can do that, and we're looking to, in general, deploy a lot of our free cash flow over the coming years to be doing share repurchases.", "We don't need any kind of a specific authorization from the board. We don't need any new authorization. We have about $500 million authorization that already exists. And so whatever we would be thinking about doing this year, we're already set for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Kai Pan", "Yes, good morning. Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to touch upon the, so basically, senior management team as well as the producers on the ground, what's the employee morale through the integration process and what's the volunteer in turnover rates?", "John Haley", "Okay. So I think one of the things that has gratified the whole management team and the \u2013 and our boards, we're discussing with them is the very positive reaction we have had from our colleagues around the world to this merger. And I think unlike some other mergers I've been involved in, in the past where you're -- when you're buying firms where there's a lot of overlap, sometimes there's angst among folks as to what their position is going to be in the new organization. With Willis Towers Watson and the relatively limited overlap we had, we've seen I think more energy and excitement among colleagues at an earlier stage than we ever have before.", "We are \u2013 we have been looking at our turnover statistics. There's nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, if anything, they're a little bit lower than I might have expected. I think that we expect that we'll see normal turnover. I was prepared for turnover, actually, especially maybe last year between announcement and the closing to be a little bit higher than usual. We did not see that, and I think that again goes back to the enthusiasm that our colleagues around the world have had for this.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. That's great. Last question. If you'd talk about what's the foreign currency exchange impact for the quarter as well as the potential Brexit potential impact on your business?", "John Haley", "Okay, Roger, do you want to start off with the currency impact?", "Roger Millay", "Well, yeah. I mean I think it was in the script that there was about $50 million, a little over $50 million of FX impact on the revenue line. I don't know that we gave an EPS impact, but it would be modest. And just to note going forward, you'll note that our guidance on FX is a little bit lower than where the pound and the euro are now. So there's probably a single digit from an EPS point of view, single-digit kind of sense, potential upside if rates stayed the way they are now.", "Kai Pan", "That's great. And then...", "John Haley", "And so I guess just on \u2013 sorry, I was going to answer on Brexit.", "Kai Pan", "Yeah.", "John Haley", "So just on that, I think, like everyone else, we're following the debate there. And there's \u2013 some people are concerned about the impact of some uncertainty in the UK, although I think the uncertainty leading up to the vote is probably as great as anything that they would see too. We see basically some cons and some pros. The London insurance market could see some premium declines accelerate. The insurance centers could move elsewhere. On the other hand, their added complexity in the marketplace is in general something that's good for consulting firms and for brokers. There would be issues around any \u2013 if people did move, wiggle entities or capital or staffing that would create opportunities for us, in particular it could benefit CRB and HCP. So I think there would be some \u2013 there would clearly be some short-term dislocations. We generally feel that when there are dislocations in the market, it favors companies that are agile and nimble and flexible and we like to think of ourselves that way.", "Kai Pan", "Great. Well, thank you so much for all the answers.", "Roger Millay", "Thank you.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you.", "John Haley", "Okay. We're going to take one more question.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company. Your line is open.", "Tim McHugh", "All right, Thanks for squeezing me in there at the end. So just some, I guess numbers questions. The \u2013 kind of the other revenue part of Exchange you talked about has very strong growth, is that project revenue or is that kind of the addition of new clients, in other words, a recurring type of uplift that we saw in that piece of the business?", "John Haley", "Yeah. There's almost no real project revenue in Exchange Solutions. The \u2013 it comes from collecting the commissions or other fees paid for the employees, but there's not a lot of special project revenue at all.", "Tim McHugh", "Okay. I didn't know.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, Tim, I just mentioned it's, to some extent maybe the main driver, the continuing success in health and welfare administration business and the new clients as we've been talking about over the last year or so.", "John Haley", "Yeah.", "Tim McHugh", "Okay. All right.", "John Haley", "Yeah. But again, that is \u2013 those are usually \u2013 Tim, those are like long-term deals where we'll sign up the client for a five-year deal or something like that, and every once in a while, if there's a big law change, that part of the business might have a \u2013 some special projects, but relatively rarely.", "Tim McHugh", "All right. That's why I was asking the question whether I didn't know if the ACA was driving...", "John Haley", "Yeah.", "Tim McHugh", "...a bunch of change orders or something like that. All right. And then you talked about the seasonality of the acquisitions here more on the legacy Willis side, can you help us at all then with the rest of the year? How much \u2013 just because we don't have the history there, I guess in terms of 2Q versus the second half as we think about those businesses, I guess how much maybe first half versus second half typically?", "Roger Millay", "I'm sorry, first half versus second half of?", "Tim McHugh", "For Gras Savoye more specifically?", "John Haley", "It's the Gras Savoye and the seasonality there, Roger.", "Tim McHugh", "Right.", "Roger Millay", "On revenues?", "Tim McHugh", "Yeah.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I think it's certainly over 50%, probably reasonably over 50% in the first half and pretty much all the profit is in the first half.", "Tim McHugh", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Haley for closing remarks.", "John Haley", "Okay. Well, thanks everyone for joining us this morning, and I look forward to talking to you on the Willis Towers Watson Earnings Call in August.

Ma'am, please begin.", "Aida Sukys", "Thanks, Howard. Good morning. This is Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations at Willis Towers Watson. Welcome to the Willis Towers Watson earnings call.

Investors should review the press release and supplemental slides we posted on our website.", "After our prepared remarks, we'll open the conference call for your questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone. Today we'll review our results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full-year of 2016. We'll also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results. Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the new Willis Towers Watson structure. We provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in an 8-K filed on July 14, 2016.", "We're pleased with our performance this quarter in a business environment that had some challenges. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.95 billion which includes $31 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis. Adjusted revenues which includes $26 million of deferred revenues were up 11% on a constant currency basis and 5% on an organic basis. Commissions and fees were up 3% on an organic basis. Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $72 million as compared to the prior year pro forma net income of $114 million.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $406 million or 20.6% of adjusted revenues as compared to the prior year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $401 million or 22.1% of adjusted revenues. The second quarter is a seasonally weak quarter due to the low level of renewals for some lines of business, primarily related to Gras Savoye and Miller where they had very strong renewals in the first quarter. Portions of the consulting and administration businesses also had weaker performance in the second quarter of the calendar year due to seasonality.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2016 was $1.077 billion or 25.4% of adjusted revenues, as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2015 of $979 million or 25.6% of adjusted revenues. Due to the seasonality quarter-over-quarter, we believe the first half of calendar 2016 is a more meaningful indicator of performance. For the quarter, earnings per diluted share were $0.51, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.66.", "Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on three areas of integration: revenue synergies, cost synergies, and tax savings. First, let's discuss the revenue synergies. We're making very good inroads in the three areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: global healthcare solutions, the midmarket healthcare exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another nine global healthcare solution clients and the pipeline continues to look very strong.", "Turning to the midmarket exchange, we've won a number of new clients with approximately 70,000 eligible lives for implementations this year, and continue to see the pipeline build. To provide some context to the 2017 wins, Willis, acting as our channel partner last year, sold approximately 9,000 lives for all of 2016.", "Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space, we've been awarded 10 new projects so far this year. We're certainly off to a strong start, but we continue to believe that our revenue synergies will be much more heavily weighted to 2017 and 2018. As we've mentioned last quarter, most of these wins will not have a significant impact on our 2016 financial results. However, we're very pleased with the progress to-date.", "Now, moving on to the tax and cost synergies. We continue to be on track to achieve our original goal of a 25% tax rate a full year ahead of schedule. We continue to expect to exceed this goal longer term. We originally estimated merger cost synergies of $100 million to $125 million by the end of 2018, and believe we're on track to achieve this goal. As noted last quarter, we plan to save about $20 million in calendar 2016 with an exit run rate of about $30 million.", "Next, I'd like to move to the operational improvement program or OIP. Incremental savings from the OIP were approximately $97 million from the second quarter of 2015. We incurred an incremental $16 million of restructuring cost in this same time period. We plan to spend approximately $165 million in 2016 and remain committed to saving $325 million by the end of 2017. OIP continues to be on track. We'll have more detailed information regarding margin impact at our Analyst Day in September.", "Now, let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of our segments. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees for Human Capital & Benefits increased 3%. Corporate Risk & Broking increased 9%. Investment, Risk, and Reinsurance increased 7%, and Exchange Solutions increased 47%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise.", "Okay, so, now let's look at each segments in more detail. Turning to Human Capital & Benefits or HCB. HCB generated growth of 3% driven primarily by the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees were flat. Retirement commissions and fees were up slightly due to strong demand in Great Britain, which was offset by the expected decline in the U.S. revenues with the decreased demand for bulk lump-sum project work.", "Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were down as the number of M&A transactions and special projects slowed year-over-year. Health and Benefits services continue to see strong demand in the U.S. large companies. And as I mentioned earlier, the global benefit solution business has strong momentum. Technology and administration solutions or TAS continued to produce solid results due to increased project and call center demand. We continue to have a positive outlook for the HCB business for the rest of 2016.", "The demand for bulk lump-sum projects and one-time annuity purchases has been picking up and we expect greater activity for the second half of the calendar year. Talent and Rewards generally has easier comps and a promising data services pipeline. We also continue to expect growth in the Health and Benefits and TAS businesses.", "Turning to Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB, commissions and fees grew 9% from the prior year, largely as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis, commissions and fees grew by 1%. In North America, commissions and fees were down slightly after a strong first quarter. Retention levels were strong, but we experienced lower levels of new business as compared to last year.", "Great Britain produced solid results as the PNC and financial lines led our growth. The international region had modest growth despite a challenging quarter for both China and Brazil. Western Europe had solid organic results given the environment. And Iberia was particularly strong, growing mid-single digit as a result of new business.", "We expect CRB to grow growth in the second half of the calendar year. We've seen some slowdown in the emerging markets but, generally, we see a good pipeline around the globe even if it is a bit softer than a year ago. While we don't believe the North America new business levels show any secular change in the market, we'll continue to monitor this closely.", "Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance. Commissions and fees grew 7% for the quarter, driven by the acquisition of Miller Insurance Services which is performing in line with our acquisition assumptions. Organic commissions and fees declined 4.5%, primarily due to a continued decline in demand for risk consulting projects, lower demand for investment advisory services, lower profit-sharing on certain insurance contracts and a slowdown in capital market.", "Capital markets commissions and fees are closely tied to the number of insurance-related M&A transactions and we've seen a significant slowdown in transactions year-over-year. Reinsurance commissions and fees were flat as the international market and the specialty business did quite well but new business was soft in North America.", "We anticipate some growth in the second half of the year as comparables get a bit easier for the IRR segment, and we may be seeing a slight increase in demand for reinsurance due to the recent losses noted by many of the carriers this past quarter. However, we expect most of the market headwinds related to this segment to continue for the rest of the calendar year.", "As discussed in the last earnings call, JLT paid a $40 million settlement in quarter two related to the Fine Arts and Jewelry team departure. This settlement was included in IRR's total revenues as other income. This item has not been adjusted out of GAAP earnings, and this is consistent with historic practice.", "Lastly, Exchange Solutions followed up the strong first quarter with another outstanding quarter, with commissions and fees of $154 million, an increase of 47%. On an organic basis, the Exchange Solutions segment grew by 43%. Driven by record enrollments, our retiree and access exchange revenues increased 48%, and the other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 44% and 36% on an organic basis. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increases. Our health and welfare administration business is growing primarily as a result of the unprecedented new business won over the last two years.", "I'd also like to provide some comments regarding the selling season for the 2017 enrollment period. We had a strong selling season, and expect to enroll over 300,000 retirees and active employees onto our exchanges. In the retiree space, a little over 100,000 retirees are expected to enroll for 2017. Now, we had a record enrollment last year as a result of the state of Ohio, and we did not anticipate duplicating the 2016 enrollment levels. While we aren't enrolling the retirees of a large state or municipality this year, we continue to feel confident in this market in the long term. However, we would also expect that the enrollments in this market will have some volatility from year-to-year.", "In the active space, we sold approximately 200,000 lives, with one client opting to enroll for 2018. We anticipate enrollment growth of approximately 80% to 100% year-over-year. I previously mentioned the success we've had in the midmarket in the very short time since the merger. I'd add one comment to my previous statements regarding the midmarket environment. It appears that the adoption rate in the midmarket has accelerated and we feel that this is sustainable.", "We continue to see strong interest from the large market, and we've had some success in winning a few large clients. But the pace of adoption continues to be slower as these organizations are still taking more time to make decisions. We can't predict the inflection point in this market, but the value exchanges provide to both the employee and employer is quite impactful, and we continue to expect the large market to be a significant part of the overall exchange market.", "We expect the second half will be strong, but we will not have any significant off-cycle enrollments this year. So, the second half commissions and fees growth rates will be lower that we've seen year-to-date. In the exchanges other, we continue to add new administration clients, but have strong comparables in the fourth quarter. So, we would expect commission and fee growth rates to normalize for this line of business as well.", "I'm encouraged by the quarterly results, the strong collaboration we're experienced at a grass roots level, the commitment to the integration efforts including the revenue synergies and, of course, the continued focus on our clients. I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their hard work in helping shape this organization for long-term success.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. I'd also like to add my thanks to our colleagues for all their hard work. Prior to the merger, in a previous call I talked about the unique opportunity we had to create a powerful organization which would be stronger than what we could have achieved as individual organizations. Now, that we're into our eighth month of integration, I'm happy to say that we're seeing clear development of these merger synergy focus areas.", "We have confirmation that the enhanced global footprint and large market relationships are having a positive impact on our global benefit solutions business. We're seeing some early success in utilizing the U.S. midmarket distribution network for our healthcare exchange. And we've had some early wins in the large market P&C space. And our cost rationalization efforts are bearing fruit. There's still a lot of hard work ahead of us, but seeing the collaboration among our colleagues and the market activity make me optimistic that we're creating the powerful organization that we envisioned.", "Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation.", "Income from operations for the quarter was $136 million or 7% of revenues. The prior year second quarter pro forma operating income was $170 million or 9.4% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $357 million or 18.1% of adjusted revenues. In the prior year quarter, pro forma adjusted operating income was $347 million or 19.2% of adjusted revenues.", "Income from operations for the first half of 2016 was $462 million or 11% of revenues. The prior year first half pro forma operating income was $553 million or 14.5% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the first half of 2016 was $1 billion or 23.7% of adjusted revenues, and the prior year first half pro forma adjusted operating income was $884 million or 23% of adjusted revenues.", "During the quarter, we recognized a net $6 million currency gain as shown in other non-operating income. This gain is driven by the reversal of a currency loss recognized on certain balance sheet positions in the first quarter. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21%, and the adjusted tax rate was 25%.", "Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues.", "For the second quarter, the operating margin for the Human Capital & Benefits segment or HCB was 15% as compared to pro forma 20% last year. Commission and fee declines in Talent and Rewards, and quarterly timing in the midmarket Health and Benefits business and in incentive costs drove the second quarter margin lower than the prior year.", "As a reminder, the North America midmarket Health and Benefits business placed a greater number of their policies in the first quarter this year, depressing the second quarter results. For the first half of 2016, the HCB segment operating margin was 24% as compared to 26% in 2015. We anticipate the HCB segment margin to be in the low 20% range for the year.", "For the second quarter, the Corporate Risk & Broking segment or CRB had a 19% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 22% in the prior year. For the first half of 2016, the CRB operating margin was 19% as compared to 17% last year. As a result of the heavy weighting of commissions and fees for Gras Savoye in the first quarter, the seasonality of the quarterly margin has changed as well. We anticipate CRB's operating margin to be around 20% for the year. The team is focused on balancing the expense base against the current revenue environment in order to drive margin enhancement.", "For the quarter, the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance segment or IRR had a 25% operating margin. The margin included the $40 million JLT settlement relating to the Fine Arts and Jewelry team departure. Without the legal settlement, IRR's operating margin would have been 17% for the second quarter or flat year-over-year. The increased margin was a result of the legal settlement and the Miller acquisition, which were partially offset by the decline in commissions and fees in the risk consulting and software and investment businesses. Inclusive of the legal settlement, we expect the IRR segment margin to be around 20% for the calendar year.", "Exchange Solutions operating margin was quite strong at 20% as compared to 8% in last year's quarter. For the first half of the calendar year, the Exchange Solutions segment operating margin was 22% as compared to 11% last year. For the quarter, the retiree and access exchanges led the segment with a 45% operating margin, with margins being flat to down for all other lines of business.", "We continue to invest in the actives exchange. Margin on the administration business is generally soft for several quarters as new clients come on the platform. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally higher in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the year due to our enrollment season. Costs build up prior to the open enrollment, but commissions and fees are recognized over the year once the policies become effective, which is typically the 1st of January.", "Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. During the quarter, we successfully issued our first public Eurobond of \u20ac540 million, six year issuance. This transaction completed our debt restructuring plan for the year. A portion of the bond proceeds were used to pay off the remaining balance on the $1 billion term loan facility we entered into in November 2015.", "We also reinitiated our stock buyback program in June. Through August 1, we've repurchased $100 million or approximately 805,000 shares. We anticipate repurchasing another $200 million by the end of December for a total repurchase of $300 million for the 2016 calendar year. Free cash flow was $265 million this quarter and $335 million for the first half of the year. Free cash flow is generally expected to build through the year.", "Now, let's review our guidance for fiscal year 2016 for Willis Towers Watson. We expect to incur approximately $150 million to $175 million for integration and transaction-related items. Our deferred revenue add-back adjustments were completed in the June quarter. Integration and transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures.", "In fiscal 2016, we expect reported revenue growth to be around 7% and constant currency revenue growth to be around 10%, with the primary drivers being the Miller and Gras Savoye acquisitions and the Exchange Solutions segment.", "We're bringing organic revenue growth guidance down to a range of 2% to 3%. Although the second quarter organic growth was quite solid at 5% overall and 3% for commissions and fees, we continue to see headwinds and lag where we expected to be. This new range reflects the market environment we've seen in the first half with some expectation of slightly improved commission and fee organic growth in the second half due to pockets of improved business momentum and areas of better sequential and year-over-year comparisons.", "We continue to expect GAAP operating income margin to be around 8% and adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. We believe the various cost reduction programs underway will allow us to keep this margin in line with previous expectations.", "In calendar 2015, pro forma GAAP operating income margin was 10.5% and pro forma adjusted operating income margin was 19.3%. The GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be in the 10% to 11% range and the adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the 23% to 24% range. We expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.48 to $2.68. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $.780, which is down from the previous guidance of $7.70 to $7.95. Guidance assumes average currency rates of $1.38 to \u00a31, and $1.11 to \u20ac1.", "Overall, I'm very pleased with the integration efforts, including the early wins that relate to our revenue synergies, the focus on margin growth and our continued progress in streamlining reporting.", "Now, I'll turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Roger, and now we'll take your questions. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question or comment comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Charles Peters", "Good morning, and thanks for hosting the call and taking our questions. I have three areas I'd like to focus on: competitive positioning, the OIP and EBITDA guidance. First on competitive positioning. Could you provide some additional color around how you see where the company is considering the recent results from some of your peers and what looks to be like some of the challenges you reported, like in legacy Towers Watson in the second quarter?", "John Haley", "Yeah. So, let's see, focusing specifically on the legacy Towers Watson there, I think we see some challenges in Talent and Rewards as I mentioned. And specifically, that is obviously the most economically sensitive of our businesses there and tends to go up and down. As we've seen a cutback on M&A and on some other projects, that has impacted where we are. We don't feel that we're losing out necessarily to the market at all. I just think we see the market as being a little bit slower.", "We do feel pretty good that we think we'll see a little more of a pickup there. We have easier comparables and we also see maybe a slightly improved pipeline for the second half of the year. So, while it's down, we don't feel that we're losing any market share and we feel that we continue to be well positioned there.", "I think in the Risk Consulting and Software and in the investment part of the business, those are both ones that have seen some challenges in the last couple of years really. And I think we continue to see them undergoing some challenges. Now, the Risk Consulting and Software is not one that our major competitors really have, so we don't have any direct comparables there. But we do see a decline in a lot of the Risk Consulting projects.", "The software piece of that business is doing relatively well. But the consulting part of the business, we're just seeing less of an appetite for that among our clients. And I would say that, again, it's not so much that it strikes us that we're losing market share there that we just see the market being softer than it had been.", "In the investment part of the world, we don't run the funds of funds, and so we don't have a direct comparison again to some of our competitors. But we are seeing a decline in some of the consulting projects around that. And so, we're seeing more of a focus to some of our delegated investment which I think was the growth area that we see. But a large part of our business has been consulting and we do see some softness there.", "If I look at the rest of the businesses, whether it's Legacy Willis or Legacy Towers Watson, I think we see some ups and downs. I think in general we're within a percent or so of where the market is going with the maybe exception of Exchange Solutions which has just had a fantastic first half of the year.", "Charles Peters", "Great color. Thank you. On the OIP - oh, go ahead.", "John Haley", "And then I think...", "Charles Peters", "Yeah. I just wanted to circle back on your comments on OIP. I know you previously said that you're on track to get the $325 million savings, but I know that a lot of it has been spent or invested so far. Can you give us an update on what you might expect to harvest in savings over the next two years of that $325 million?", "John Haley", "Yeah. So, that's a subject of intense study by us right now. And I think, Greg, we're really targeting next month when we have the Analyst Day to present the detailed analysis of that. But I think that it's safe for us to say that I think we're changing a little bit - no, we're changing a lot - the focus of OIP to say what we're concerned with is not what the cost reduction is, what we're concerned with is what the margin improvement is. And so, we'll be prepared to address that next month.", "Charles Peters", "Perfect. And just - I can use that to dovetail into the EBITDA issue. It looks like the guidance is just a tad lower than where it was before. I'm curious if that changes the calculation or the calculus on the debt and the rating agency discussions? And more importantly, ultimately, we're trying to reconcile EBITDA with your longer term target, I think it was 25% by the end of 2018, so any color there would be helpful?", "John Haley", "Yeah. I'll let Roger address that.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. Just to the first question, no impact on any rating agency matters at all. And in terms of the goal, I mean we - as John said, we will be talking about the levers to get to the goal by 2018 and we're still focused on that and creating the structure internally to drive to that.", "Charles Peters", "Great. Thanks for the color.", "John Haley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your line is open.", "Robert Glasspiegel", "Good morning. Quick question on the Reinsurance organic guidance, just making sure. We knew about the JLT settlement when you gave the prior guidance, so I assume we're not factoring in any lost revenues from departures in the revised lower guidance, it's other factors that you cited?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. I think that that's right. So, of course, there's a lot to IRR and John already talked about the Legacy Towers Watson Risk and Financial Services piece, there's no revision in that guidance related to the departure of the Fine Arts and Jewelry team or no change at all really with respect to that matter.", "Robert Glasspiegel", "Just clarifying that, you don't look to see any significant revenue lost from the departures? You can replace that with new hires or is that a ...", "Roger Millay", "No. What I'm saying is...", "John Haley", "No. That's already in there is what we're saying. It was already in there previously.", "Robert Glasspiegel", "Right. And what is the revenue impact from the departures? Is it material?", "John Haley", "I think it's about $10 million. Is that right?", "Roger Millay", "Somewhere in that neighborhood.", "John Haley", "Or is it about $20 million a year?", "Roger Millay", "$20 million revenue.", "John Haley", "Yeah, yeah.", "Roger Millay", "$20 million, about $20 million.", "Robert Glasspiegel", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. The free cash flow operations in the quarter was roughly $300 million from your cash flow statement. What were the big drivers in improvement there in the quarter?", "Roger Millay", "Well, so if you're looking sequentially, of course, we paid incentive comp in the first quarter. So, for...", "Robert Glasspiegel", "I was looking more year-over-year. It was $300 million versus $70 million?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, versus even $7 million, I think. So, when you're looking at a comparative cash flow statement, that's just the Legacy Willis cash flow statement. So, the biggest difference is really the consolidation of the companies and the free cash that's been added as a result of the merger.", "Robert Glasspiegel", "There weren't any significant items in and out that distorted the operating trend to cash flow?", "Roger Millay", "No. Just the performance of the business and what you would expect in the June quarter from the Legacy Towers Watson business. So, no distortion.", "Robert Glasspiegel", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Hi. Good morning. First question, in terms of your guidance, what are you including for currency on earnings for the back half of the year? And also, what was the currency impact in the Q2, and what had you been assuming for currency, I guess, in your prior earnings guidance.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. I mean, I think the rates - I don't have the rates in the prior. I mean, obviously, the pound is down, the euro is about the same, I think it was - I think we're at $1.11 and it was $1.11. Off-hand, I don't have it. Are you asking for what the rates are that are assumed in the second half?", "Elyse Greenspan", "No. I'm just asking what bottom line impact on EPS are you expecting in the second half of the year.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. We'll have to get back to you on that, Elyse. We don't have that on our fingertips.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. Do you know what the currency hit was in the Q2 on earnings?", "Roger Millay", "About $31 million.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. Great. And then in terms of the margin just going back into the EBITDA margin for this quarter in particular. So, if you kind of back out the JLT gain, you probably get close to about 400 basis points of deterioration when you look to last year. I know you said that there are some seasonality from some of the Legacy Willis acquisitions. But can you just kind of go into more detail, I guess, on what outside of just those two acquisitions is really driving the margin deterioration and how, I guess, you expect that to flip as you move - expect margin improvement in the back half of the year, and as you go towards that 25% target?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. So, that's why we gave you the six-month margins. So, for six months, the margins were either slightly up or about the same as last year. So, that illustrates the seasonal timing impact. And it's really, as we said in the first quarter call, the Gras Savoye revenues came in - about 70% of their revenues came in in the first quarter. So, there's extreme seasonality that drove that. So, again, as we said in the script, we think the six-month margin numbers are more indicative of where the company is.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. And then on the organic, the outlook for the risk and brokerage business for the second half of the year, it's implying some level of improvement versus half-year one. And I'm just curious how you kind of think about that business evolving on an organic basis, especially as you kind of look to Legacy Willis, the results there, is that you get a little bit tougher comps in the second half of the year. So, what's driving the organic improvement in your mind?", "Roger Millay", "And this was in IRR you're asking about?", "John Haley", "CRB.", "Roger Millay", "CRB?", "Elyse Greenspan", "Yeah.", "Roger Millay", "In CRB? Yeah. I mean, it does imply a little bit better second half. There are some areas where there's a pipeline that supports that growth level. There are areas where the difficulty in the first half or even the first quarter won't be repeated. For instance, we talked last quarter about the South Stream project that was a one-time write-off. There are also areas where seasonality of growth actually in the last couple years has been stronger in the second half. So, while it's not a big pickup, there are several factors that drive that expectation.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. And then one last question, if I may. You guys started repurchasing stock probably a little bit earlier than we were expecting, yet I noticed in your guidance the share count stayed the same. How come?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. We had this odd phenomenon based on the merger close that, because it closed on January 4, actually, and we're talking plus 1 million shares here. But the count was a little bit lower that the real run rate coming in to the merged company in the first quarter. So, we're now on a path where given the share repurchases we talked about, and now that the timing is normalized, we'll be seeing downward impacts to the share count.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Roger Millay", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Quentin McMillan from KBW. Your line is open.", "Quentin McMillan", "Hi. Thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to ask about the operational improvement program. John, thank you. It seems like you're going to give obvious a lot more color at the upcoming Investor Day, so look forward to that. But can you just clarify something? It seems that you just said that you're not focused on the cost reduction but what the margin improvement is. Am I reading correctly to assume that you're thinking that revenue synergies and top-line boost from potential gains from the operational improvement are what you now are focusing on and that the underlying expense savings are not necessarily what's going to drive the margin improvement?", "John Haley", "No, no. That wasn't what I meant to say. What I meant to say was that we don't see getting a cost reduction by itself as the end game. What we see as the endgame is getting margin improvement. And so, what we want to look at it, the OIP is to say, how does this result in margin improvement? And that's going to be what our focus is.", "Quentin McMillan", "Okay. Great. Appreciate that. And then, second question for you, John. People are now looking out to your own compensation metric $10.10 in 2018 as sort of the longer term guidance. I know you guys haven't necessarily put that out there, but that's what some are talking about. So, I just wanted to sort of laid out the baseline of holding the macro flag. If we live in an environment with a 2% GDP, the 10-year stays around 2%, inflation is constant, and the P&C rates stay in this negative - a couple hundred basis points maybe. Is that an environment where you feel confident that you're going to be able to drive towards that $10.10 number in 2018 or is there something that maybe needs to break to the upside for you to reach that?", "John Haley", "No, look I think one of the things we knew that when we were putting together Willis and Towers Watson was that the first year we would have some puts and takes and it would be a little bit messy, and we were in some ways in a difficult environment. But frankly, all the different possibilities that are there from the merger, whether it's revenue synergies, cost synergies, tax synergies, whatever, we think all of those things provide tremendous upside. And so, I continue to be bullish about the prospects. And as I told investors from the beginning, this is a three year project for us. It's one of the reasons why we put together the compensation plan the way we did. It focused on those metrics. And I continue to be positive about hitting them. So I'm still focused on that.", "Quentin McMillan", "Great. And if I could just - very quickly for the guidance in terms of the 2% to 3% organic growth, are we assuming that that $40 million is in a total organic growth number? The 2% to 3% you're giving is total, it's not commissions and fees organic growth and the $40 million JLT will be in there?", "Roger Millay", "That's right. It's total revenue.", "Quentin McMillan", "Okay. Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "David Styblo", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just want to talk about the areas of weakness and get a better understanding of what you guys think is under your control versus what's market related. We heard a lot of threads between China, a soft M&A market, some discretionary spending that happens by employers for Legacy Towers business. It seems predominantly market-related, but I just want to get a sense of the potential improvement, not so much for this year but also next year in terms of what you think you can do to change and improve the organic growth profile of the company?", "John Haley", "Yeah. So, let me just sort of talk about that at an overall level there. I think - as you mentioned, when I was responding to the question about the Legacy Towers Watson, I said to the extent we see some areas that are underperforming, we have a sense that it's the market and not so much specific things going there.", "One of the things that makes it a little bit difficult is in some of those areas like Risk Consulting and Software, we don't have natural competitors that are public companies to look to see what the market is. But our overall sense is just that the market is down there. And we've been through this. We see some ups and downs. We have areas like our old Talent and Rewards that are very heavily dependent on the economy overall. So, we see those going on.", "We have similar areas like that from the Legacy Willis part of the business. So, when we look at the capital markets area there, that's a small area, but it's one that is very sensitive to the amount of insurance-related M&A transactions that are going on. And for comparison, last year, there was $110 billion in M&A transactions in the insurance space. So far, this year, there's been $10 billion. That's a pretty big difference and it's one of the reasons why that has contributed to a decline in the IRR this year.", "I think when we look at it, there's a couple areas where we are trailing the market. I think if we look at our Corporate Risk & Broking and if we look at the Reinsurance, we're a little bit lower than the market there. I think in both cases, we look at those as it may be in some cases of portfolio effect. So for example, I think the international, which has been the real source of growth for Willis versus the market over the last several years, that's the area that's particularly down this year. So, that may affect us more than some of our competitors. But I think it's safe to say that we're probably a percent or so below them this year.", "We don't see anything that's structural. We think that some of that is related to just some goings on in the business that we expect to reverse themselves and we expect to be growing at about the level of the market or better in 2017.", "David Styblo", "Okay. That's helpful. On the exchanges, just to make sure I square the numbers right. So, I think you said 300,000, was that all for 2017, because I think there was also a comment about one of the employers or one of the clients was going to be landing in 2018 and wasn't sure what the impact of that was? And then, also while on the exchanges, should we expect margins to rise consistently from here on out year-over-year as the business starts to scale more? I'm just trying to juxtapose that against comments about continued investments in the active side of the business.", "John Haley", "Yeah. So, I think what we had said was, we do expect to enroll about 300,000 in total.", "David Styblo", "And those are not total covered lives, those are just actual employees. Right?", "John Haley", "Actually, what I should have said is we've sold 300,000 in total that we will be enrolling in both 2017 and one of them that's going to be deferred to 2018. One of the big ones that's deferred to 2018 is about 60,000. So, it's a big case that is deferred.", "David Styblo", "Got it. Okay. And then lastly, just on bridging the EPS a little bit. So, I guess $0.13 decline at the midpoint. Certainly, I'd imagine it's the organic growth is driving the vast majority of that. Are there any one-timers on the positive side, whether that be FX because I think the way the currency moves that actually benefits your earnings, although my understanding is you also have some hedges in place, not sure if that mitigates it. But is there a bit of a bridge you could provide us, so we have a clearer understanding of $0.13 drop at the midpoint?", "John Haley", "Yeah. So, I think, well, as Roger said, we'll get out some more detail on the actual currency effects and everything. I think we do have some hedges which take about 70% or 75% or so of the difference there. It's something like that.", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. I mean, so specifically the pound sterling is pretty much offset when you take the hedges into consideration. I mean, I think the big driver of the, as you said, of the downgraded guidance is the organic growth expectation.", "John Haley", "And I think if you look at it, look, in the first quarter we had revenue growth. Initially, we had said it was going to be in the mid-single digits and we said it was going to be muted. And so, that meant we were in the lower end of that. That's because it was down to about 3% to 4%. And now, we're looking and saying actually it's probably going to be closer to 2% to 3%. And so, we wanted to come out with some specific numbers this time but I think that's the overall effect.", "We have gone back and done - and Roger sort of alluded to this - we've gone back and done a re-forecasting exercise to look at what are reasonable revenue growth expectations. We feel pretty comfortable about that 2% to 3%. We think that's a pretty good number.", "David Styblo", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company. Your line is open.", "Timothy McHugh", "Thanks. Just to follow up on the exchange, two questions. One, I guess - sorry, I was a little confused. So, the 300,000 includes the 60,000 that's deferred into next year?", "John Haley", "That's correct.", "Timothy McHugh", "Okay.", "John Haley", "Sorry, Tim. We were talking. The 300,000 is the total we sold. And this client has signed up for 2018 already. So, we've already done that. But it does include everything, yeah.", "Timothy McHugh", "And then the 80% to 100% growth, what piece was that referring to?", "John Haley", "That was the enrollment growth in the active space year-over-year.", "Timothy McHugh", "Not including the 60,000 because that will take effect in...", "John Haley", "That's correct. Not including the 60,000, we'll still have the 80% to 100% growth.", "Timothy McHugh", "Okay. And on the retiree side, I get you're not going to have an Ohio every year, but how do you feel competitively you held up? Were there just not opportunities, or was there any change in the competitive dynamics in terms of competing for some of the larger retiree opportunities?", "John Haley", "No. No change in the competitive dynamics. There was not any big case like the Ohio case or even one any remotely close to that this year. So, yeah. We feel like we continue to have by far the strongest offering in the retiree exchange space.", "Timothy McHugh", "Okay. And then last question, just turnover. Where's it trended year-to-date, I guess, and I guess besides just the overall turnover number, I guess, any sense of how meaningful the turnover is in terms of key individuals?", "John Haley", "Yeah. So, I think, overall, frankly, the turnover has been lower than I would have expected. We were running, I think for last year or so, a little over 10%, in voluntary turnover, and we're actually running just under 10% now, which I used to think in terms of when we were in just the consulting area, whether it was Watson Wyatt or Towers Watson, I used to think of maybe 10% to 12% voluntary turnover rate as being about the right level. And I think there's probably more turnover in the brokerage market generally. So, I would've expected that to be somewhat higher.", "So, I think coming in at just under 10% - we're at 9.8% or something like that now - is a little bit lower than I'd expected, and so that's where we feel about that overall. When we look at the - there is obviously seasonality. And so, we noticed this in the old Towers Watson days, you get more turnover after you've just paid bonuses than you do there. We continue to see that, no particular changes there.", "And I think when we look at specifically where we've had some competitors try to target some of our individuals, one of the things we do is we prioritize those, and we don't necessarily try to respond to every raid on an employee like that. And we target the ones that we think are the real high value employees. We've been very successful at that, and we've continued to hold on to the ones that we really wanted to.", "Timothy McHugh", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Mark Marcon", "All right. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. With regards to the Exchange Solutions, can you just talk about that midmarket pipeline and what your expectations would be for continued sales through the balance of this year that can go into effect in 2017? And then I have a follow-up question on a different area.", "John Haley", "Yeah. So, I don't have right off at my fingertips here, Mark, the relative numbers for the second half. But the midmarket is different than the large market in that you can continue that sales that occur up until almost the November timeframe and still implement them. But by far the bulk of it will occur in the first half. So, I don't have at my fingertips whether it's like 80% occurs in the first half or it's probably something like that, but we'll get you those numbers.", "I would think it's safe to say, though, that the bulk of the sales have already occurred by far, although there will be some continuing. I think I made a comment in the script to say that we look at the midmarket as saying that it's accelerated and that we feel that that's sustainable. So, that's based on our talking with clients, our seeing what's happening to the pipeline, so I don't think we're expecting to see. We've had a terrific first half of the year in terms of selling this. We're not predicting any decline in the second half as a result of that. We think we're going to continue to see the midmarket being an important source of new business.", "Mark Marcon", "Can you talk us about the existing clients in terms of their experiences? What sort of client retention rate you're current lead running? What are the savings that you're currently experiencing? And also, to what extent do you think the ACA, all the work that went into getting ready for 1094s, 1095 may have distracted people from putting in place exchanges for this year.", "John Haley", "So, I think in terms of the overall savings, we can see that varied significantly. It can vary based on the specific geographical distribution of the employers. It can vary based on what kind of plan they're coming from, whether they already had a plan that, for example, had high deductibles or what other features they might have already had built into it.", "Generally, we look at savings between 5% and 15% for the employer, although often what will happen is the employers will probably give about one-third of that back to the employees and keep about two-thirds. So when they make the exchange, it's a win-win for both the employer and the employee in terms of the cost aspect of that. That's been something that we've seen since the beginning and we're not seeing any change in that overall.", "I think in terms of the adoption rate, it's hard to say exactly whether people are distracted by some of these other ACA things. I tend to think that that's not the case. I think we have seen, as I said, the midmarket pickup. And in fact, if you're thinking about employers that might be distracted more, you might think that actually it's the smaller one that have more of those distractions.", "So, I don't think that's what we're really seeing there. I do think we're seeing the natural conservatism of larger organizations continue to be a factor in the marketplace. But we are seeing the smaller ones adopting it somewhat more enthusiastically than they did even a year ago.", "Mark Marcon", "Great. And then can you just comment with regard to your UK business? I mean, Bank of England just took down their growth forecast. So, to what extent do you think your overall portfolio of UK businesses are cyclically sensitive?", "John Haley", "Yeah. I think they - the whole impact of Brexit, of course we did that call the other day and I guess it was last month after Brexit and went through that. I would say that we really don't have any change in views or necessarily guidance from then to now. When we look at Brexit, I think it's a hodgepodge of both pluses and minuses.", "And when we look at our overall exposure, for example, in Corporate Risk & Broking, the overall CRB revenue exposure, it's about 7% of our revenues. So, it's not like we see that that is the biggest deal in the world. If markets were to move from London to elsewhere, it's not clear that we're disadvantage by that. In fact, we might even be advantaged depending on where it were to move to. So, I think there's nothing that we see now that we say, this is necessarily a problem for us. I mean, I think even at the senior levels of our company we have different views as to the impact of Brexit overall. Some of us have - I've been relatively relaxed about the notion of Brexit. Some other people are more concerned about that. But I think overall we don't see - the movement of the BofE today isn't anything that was unexpected, and I don't think it changes our overall guidance.", "Mark Marcon", "Great. Thank you.", "John Haley", "Okay. I think we'll take one more question. So.", "Operator", "All right, sir. Our final question or comment comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you so much for fitting me in. Just on the free cash flow usage. Like how much you plan to spending on deleveraging the balance sheet and merger acquisitions as well as buybacks? Is that - can you spend most of your - would rating agency have issues with you spending most of your free cash flow on return to shareholders?", "John Haley", "A number of angles in there. So, maybe just stay at the last one. Everything that we're doing has been part of the communications with the rating agencies. So, we've been managing that internal and there are no issues there. With respect to the usages ultimately of free cash for the year, as we've said, we expect another $200 million of share repurchases at this point and we continue to evaluate that quarter to quarter based on how the company performs. So, that's where we are for right now.", "Kai Pan", "Are you considering [indiscernible] deleveraging or like are there going to be any sort of like on the merger front as well?", "Roger Millay", "So, I mean I think as we - we're in the same kind of mindset that we talked about, I think, last quarter, which was stabilizing the rating agency metrics and around the level that support our current rating. And there are a lot of angles to the rating agencies calculations, but it doesn't imply significant deleveraging.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. That's great. Last one, if I may. It's just like press a little bit further Quentin's earlier question. If organic growth is going to be slower that you currently expected going forward, are there other levers you can pull on the expense side will enable you still be able to achieve your $10-plus by 2018?", "Roger Millay", "Well, I don't know.", "John Haley", "I mean we think that - we have plans to get to the $10-plus level even with modest organic growth. So, we remain confident about hitting that.", "Kai Pan", "That's great. Well, thank you so much for the questions.", "John Haley", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "John Haley", "Thanks everybody else for joining us this morning and I look forward to talking to you at Analyst Day in September.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would like to introduce your host for today's conference Ms. Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.", "Aida Sukys", "Thanks very much and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Willis Towers Watson earnings call. On the call today are John Haley, Willis Towers Watson Chief Executive Officer, and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please refer to our website for the press release issued earlier today. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for a replay via telephone through Monday by dialing 404-537-3406, conference ID 4925029. The replay will also be available for the next three months on our website.", "This call may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 involving risks and uncertainties.

Now I will turn the call of the John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Aida. Good morning, everyone. Today we will review our results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide updated guidance for the full year of 2016. We will also provide consolidated 2016 and certain pro forma 2015 financial results.", "Our segment results for this quarter are presented based on the new Willis Towers Watson structure. We provided historical Willis Towers Watson segment information in an 8-K filed on July 14, 2016.", "I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to address the management changes we announced last week. First, I\u2019d like to thank Dominic Casserley for his contributions to Willis and all of his efforts in assisting in the creation of Willis Towers Watson. Dominic has been a terrific partner throughout the entire transaction and integration process.", "Second, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the appointments we\u2019ve made to the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance and the Corporate Risk & Broking businesses and to the Americas region. Not only have we enhanced the operating committee by increasing the strength of the brokerage perspective, but I\u2019m very excited about bringing the vision and passion Carl Hess, Todd Jones and Joe Gunn bring to their new roles. I\u2019m confident that based on their previous success and the depth of their knowledge of our business they will continue to be strong and effective leaders.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our results for the quarter. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.78 billion, a 2% increase on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year. This includes $51 million of negative currency movement on a pro forma basis.", "Commissions and fees for the reportable segments were up 2% on an organic basis. The net loss attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the quarter was $32 million as compared to the prior-year pro forma net income of $209 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $275 million, or 15.5% of revenues as compared to the prior-year pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $307 million or 17.6% of revenues.", "The year-over-year decline is due to revenue pressure from CRV and IRR and the seasonality of Gras Savoye business. Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2016 was $1.35 billion or 22.5% of adjusted revenues as compared to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2015 of $1.27 billion, or 22.8% of adjusted revenues. For the quarter, loss per diluted share was $0.23 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.04. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a negative impact of $0.02 on adjusted EPS.", "Before moving on to the segment results I\u2019d like to provide an update on three areas of integration: revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. First, let\u2019s discuss the revenue synergies. In the first year we expected to achieve sales of approximately 5% to 10% of our stated 2018 revenue synergies.", "We are where we want to be but we also realize that achieving our first year goals is a small portion of our overall objective and we still have a lot of work ahead of us. As we've discussed on previous calls, the Global Health Solutions and mid market revenues will primarily be recognized in 2017. The majority of the P&C wins will also impact 2017 and beyond. We are continuing to make good progress in the three areas of revenue synergies we've outlined in our previous communications: Global Healthcare Solutions, the mid market healthcare exchange and the U.S. large market P&C sector. We've won another six Global Healthcare Solution clients this quarter and the pipeline continues to look very strong. We also won 30 single country multinational assignments.", "Turning to the mid market exchange, as previously discussed we sold approximately 70,000 eligible lives for the 2017 enrollment. We may see a pause in sales activity while the enrollment season is underway but continue to be pleased with our 2018 sales pipeline. Lastly, in the U.S. P&C large company space we've been awarded 16 new projects so far this year. Now moving on to the tax and cost synergies, we continue to be on track to achieve our original goal of a 25% adjusted tax rate a full year ahead of schedule, in fact. We continue to expect to exceed this goal longer term. We originally estimated merger cost synergies of 100 million to 125 million by the end of 2018 and believe we are on track to achieve this goal. We continue to estimate savings of approximately $20 million in calendar 2016 with an exit run rate of at least $30 million.", "Next I'd like to move to the operational improvement program or OIP. Incremental savings from OIP where proximally $14 million from the third quarter of 2015. We incurred an incremental $11 million of restructuring costs in this same time period. We plan to spend approximately $165 million in 2016 for restructuring charges. Now let's look at the performance as well as our revenue and margin expectations of each of our segments. On an overall constant currency basis, commissions and fees for Human Capital & Benefits increased 5%; Corporate Risk & Broking increased 8%; Investment, Risk & Reinsurance decreased 5%; and Exchange Solutions increased 25%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency unless specifically stated otherwise. ", "Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. Turning to Human Capital & Benefits or HCB, HCB generated growth of 5% driven primarily by the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis commissions and fees increased 2%. Retirement commissions and fees were up slightly due to increased bulk lump sum project work in the U.S. and new pension administration client implementations which were offset by softness in the Netherlands. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were up as a result of strong demand for executive compensation work and the delivery of data surveys, but we continue to experience softness in the Rewards, Talent and Communication business in North America and EMEA.", "Moving to health and benefits, we continue to see strong demand in the large company space globally with strong product and plan management activity in North America. Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, contributed to produce solid results due to new clients and higher call center demand. We continue to have a positive outlook for HCB business for the rest of 2016. We should continue to see bulk lump sum projects in the fourth quarter. Talent and Rewards is seasonally in the second half of the calendar year and we continue to expect growth in the health and benefits and TAS businesses.", "Turning to Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB, commissions and fees grew 8% from the prior year as a result of the Gras Savoye acquisition. On an organic basis commissions and fees were flat. Revenue declines in North America and in the International business offset the growth in Great Britain and Western Europe. In North America a one-time project in 2015 created a strong comparable and our new business was lower than expected.", "China and Brazil accounted for most of the revenue declines in our International business as a result of the economic and political climate in those countries. Great Britain had very strong results across all lines of business and Iberia led the growth for Western Europe with some weakness in Denmark and with the Affinity business. We expect Great Britain and Western Europe to continue providing revenue growth and we don't see any significant near-term changes in the Asian and Latin American markets. We are seeing a small pricing headwind in the North American market and continue to focus on building our new business pipeline. Overall we expect similar results in the fourth quarter.", "Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance, commissions and fees were down by 5% for the quarter. Organic commissions and fees declined 5% primarily due to a decline in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets business. The decline in North America Reinsurance revenues offset the revenue growth in the other region. The Capital Markets business, which is generally volatile and is dependent on transactions, generated its highest revenue ever in the third quarter of calendar year 2015 and had nominal revenue this quarter. So while the business is rather small to our portfolio, the volatility had a material impact on the growth of the segment.", "On a positive note we continue to see wholesale delivering solid results from Miller. Risk consulting had modest revenue growth led by software sales and investment had a very strong quarter as a result of increased performance fees and a soft comparable in the third quarter of 2015. We anticipate that IRR will continue to see headwinds in the Reinsurance and Capital Markets businesses as we don't expect the overall environment to change by the end of the calendar year.", "Lastly, Exchange Solutions followed up the strong first half with another outstanding quarter with commissions and fees of $161 million, an increase of 25%. Driven by record enrollments our Retiree and Access Exchanges the new increased 35% and the other Exchange Solutions businesses increased 14%. Increased membership in new clients drove the revenue increases. Our health and welfare administration business continues to grow, primarily as a result of the new business we've won over the last two years. We continue to receive high satisfaction scores from retirees where 95% feel they selected the right plans to best meet their needs and we have an overall 93% retiree satisfaction rate. We've also experienced 100% renewal as our first round of active Exchange client contracts were ending this year.", "We expect the fourth-quarter revenue growth to be more moderate as the retiree and health and welfare businesses start to overlap the strong enrollment numbers and new clients which were added in the fourth quarter of calendar year '15 which created a strong comparable.", "I'm pleased with the progress on a number of initiatives associated with the merger, especially the focus on revenue synergies. We are even seeing crossover in marketing efforts we did not contemplate as we created Willis Towers Watson and we remain committed to continue to support and encourage these activities. In order to provide the investments needed to attain our growth goals we are taking steps to help ensure we achieve our merger commitments of enhanced margins and shareholder return. We are extremely focused on balancing our growth initiative while maintaining financial discipline. I feel we have the right team in place to deliver the 2017 objectives and beyond.", "And last I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for their enthusiasm in supporting our efforts and their continued steadfast commitments to our clients. Now I will turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Great, thanks John and good morning to everyone. I'd like to add my congratulations to Todd Jones, Carl Hess and Joe Gunn. I'm excited about how the experience Todd, Carl and Job bring to the table aligns with our long-term opportunities and goals. Based on their proven track records I'm confident in their future success. Now for our financial results; as a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation. Income from operations for the quarter was $1 million, or 0.1% of revenues. The prior-year third-quarter pro forma operating income was $104 million, or a 5.9% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $243 million, or 13.7% of revenues and the prior-year quarter pro forma adjusted operating income was $267 million, or 15.3% of revenues.", "As we highlighted earlier, revenue pressure and seasonality related to Gras Savoye impacted the third-quarter margin. Income from operations for the first nine months of 2016 was $463 million, or 7.8% of revenues. The prior-year first nine months pro forma operating income was $632 million or 11.3% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of 2016 was $1.25 billion, or 20.7% of adjusted revenues. And the prior-year first nine months pro forma adjusted operating income was $1.13 billion, or 20.3% of revenues. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 46% and the adjusted tax rate was 22%. Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the 8-K we filed on July 14, 2016. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues. For the third quarter the operating margin for the Human Capital & Benefits segment or HCB was 16% as compared to pro forma 17% last year. As expected, the 2016 margin trended lower due to the Gras Savoye margin being lower than the Company average.", "For the first nine months of 2016 the HCB segment operating margin was 22% as compared to pro forma 23% in 2015. We continue to anticipate the HCB segment operating margin will be in the low 20% range for the year. For the third quarter the Corporate Risk & Broking segment or CRB had an 11% operating margin as compared to a pro forma 14% operating margin in the prior-year third quarter. Revenue pressure from North America and the International business impacted margin.", "The heavy weighting of Gras Savoye in the first quarter has also changed the seasonality of the quarterly margin. For the first nine months the operating margins for 2016 and pro forma for 2015 were 16%.", "We continue to anticipate CRB\u2019s operating margin to be around 20% for the year. The change in leadership has not impacted the focus to drive margin enhancement.", "For the quarter the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance segment or IRR had an 8% operating margin as compared to pro forma 10% operating margin in the prior-year third quarter. The revenue pressure from Capital Markets and Reinsurance was generally offset by growth in wholesale, risk consulting and investment.", "For the first nine months of 2016 the IRR segment operating margin was 26% as compared to pro forma 25% in 2015. Inclusive of the JLT legal settlement we continue to expect the IRR segment margin to be around 20% for the calendar year.", "Exchange Solutions operating margin for the quarter and the prior-year pro forma was 12%. For the first nine months of the calendar year the Exchange Solutions segment operating margin was 18% as compared to 11% pro forma in the prior year.", "For the quarter, Retiree and Access Exchanges led the segment with a 27% operating margin as we continue to invest in the active exchange. For 2016, we expect the Exchange Solutions segment margin to be in the mid-teens. As a reminder, margins are seasonally hunger in the first half of the calendar year as compared to the second half of the calendar year due to cost buildup for the enrollment season. Commissions and fees are recognized over the year once the policies become effective, which is typically January 1.", "Moving to the balance sheet we continue to have a strong financial position. As of September 30, we had repurchased $233 million of Willis Towers Watson stock. We continue to anticipate a total repurchase of $300 million for 2016.", "Free cash flow was $122 million this quarter and $457 million for the first nine months of the year. Free cash flow is generally expected to build through the year. We still expect to deliver approximately $650 million in free cash flow for 2016.", "Now let\u2019s review our guidance for fiscal year 2016. We expect to incur approximately $150 million to $175 million for both integration and transaction-related items and restructuring items. Integration and transaction-related expenses and restructuring costs will continue to be adjusted from our GAAP measures.", "In fiscal 2016 we are adjusting the expected reported revenue growth to be around 6% and constant currency revenue growth to be in the 9% to 10% range with the primary growth drivers being the Gras Savoye acquisition and the Exchange Solutions segment. Last quarter we estimated that organic revenue growth would be in the 2% to 3% range. Based on the third quarter results we now expect organic revenue growth to be around 2%. We expect GAAP operating income margin to be around 7% and adjusted operating income margin to be around 20%. In calendar 2015 pro forma GAAP operating income margin was 10.5% and pro forma adjusted operating income margin was 19.3%. We are progressing with various cost reduction programs which will allow us to keep this margin in line with previous expectations. We believe that we are beginning to realize the results of this cost control work. While costs can ebb and flow and it can be difficult to fully lock down sequential organic momentum we believe we saw modest net sequential enterprise expense reduction in Q2 and that we enhanced the level of sequential reduction in the third quarter versus the second. Assuming continued organic revenue growth this is the path to margin expansion momentum in 2017.", "On a segment basis, we are holding margin estimates to previously reported estimates for all segments. For revenue guidance we will be referring to organic commissions and fees. Based on the third quarter results we are maintaining low single digit revenue growth for HCB, lowering CRB revenue estimates from low single digit growth to flat, lowering IRR revenue estimates from a low single digit decline to a mid single digit decline and, finally, increasing Exchange Solutions revenue growth from high 20%s to around 30%.", "The GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be in the range of 5% to 7% and the adjusted tax rate is expected to be around 23%. We expected GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.80, which is in line with our previous guidance. While our financial results this year haven't been as strong as we hoped, this adjusted EPS range represents upper teens percentage growth over the merger pro forma for 2015. Guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.35 to the pound and $1.12 to the euro.", "I continue to be pleased with the integration efforts. While we are seeing early signs of success in areas like reducing the tax rate, winning projects aligned to our revenue synergies and a greater focus on margin management, many of these initiatives are building the foundation for 2017 and beyond. I remain confident in achieving our long term success.", "Now I will turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks very much Roger. And now we will take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Hi, good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. John, can you just talk a little bit about the progress to date versus the long term goals? It's slower out of the box on the revenue side and clearly you need the CRB segment to pick up in revenue growth on an organic basis to get to where you want to be in a couple of years. What are you seeing internally in the business that makes you feel comfortable that you are going to see that progress over the next year or so?", "John Haley", "Thanks Shlomo, I think as we came into this year we could see there were some headwinds in some of the businesses that we were facing a little bit. I think we've seen North America has been a place where we've probably seen it, particularly in CRB more than in some areas although International has also been a place where we've experienced a good bit of a decline there. We see those things as being turning around somewhat next year. I think we had tough comparables on the International, for example, last year. We had some reversals of some income that we had booked in 2015 that occurred this year that we have gone on. I think when we said what we were going to try to do this year it was first we were going to try to make sure we got the right kind of margins and then we were going to use that platform to build with profitable revenue growth. I think that's still been our focus. We feel pretty good about coming in at exactly what we had said last quarter with the EPS.", "We might be a percent or so lower on or at the bottom end of the revenue guidance that we gave last quarter. But we still feel we will come in right around there. I think with the new team we have in place, too, I think one of the things I like about that with some strong brokerage representation from North America leading both CRB and the Americas geography, I think we are well poised to turn around North America there. So I do feel like we have the right people there. We have the right offerings and I think we just need to build on that.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "So is there anything marketwise that you feel has increased headwinds in North America broking or do you really think it's a people item or a combination?", "John Haley", "I think you always have a little bit of loss whenever you go through some big changes like this in the merger that we did. So I think we probably lost a little bit of that. I think as we put the organization together we probably made it a little too complex, too, and I know one of the things that both Todd and Joe Gunn are focused on is making sure that we streamline some of the organization and are spending more time with clients and less time internally.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Okay, and then in the IRR business it seems the guidance implies a pretty big step down next quarter. And is there -- can you just give us a little bit of a thought as to what's in play over there and is that something that we should continue to see those kinds of declines or is that specific to the quarter but don't think about it that way for say next year or so?", "John Haley", "I think IRR it's a mixture of a number of businesses. As we said in the script, the Capital Markets business is a relatively smaller part of that overall portfolio but in this particular quarter, best quarter ever in the third quarter of 2015. And nominal revenue is really -- I mean, it was pretty close to zero so it was really quite nominal revenue for this year. And it reflects the fact that there's just been a dearth of deals in the insurance business generally. And so we are not expecting to see, for example, that to pick back up in the fourth quarter, although we do see some signs that 2017, we have had a couple of wins recently that could very well deliver some nice revenue in 2017. So we will have to see about that. Reinsurance we have, we are facing some headwinds in Reinsurance. Our Facultative Reinsurance, of course, is off in CRB, so we don't report that in IRR. And that's the part of the business that's been growing more than the tree. We see that business as still facing some headwinds. I think some of the restructurings that our clients have done and some of the just withdrawal of Reinsurance from the market as you've seen some big mergers have also contributed to headwinds for us there. So again we are not projecting that the fourth quarter is going to be a big improvement there either. I think some of the other businesses, investment which has been down for a number of quarters here we saw some real improvement in the third quarter, and I think we feel better about the fourth quarter now than we would have a quarter or so ago. And I think we are beginning to see some signs in the Risk Consulting & Software of a bit of a pickup. So it is a mixed bag. But I think we continue to see pressure on Reinsurance and we continue to see Capital Markets as being down. And I think overall that's what contributes to a lower forecast for the fourth quarter for that segment.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "If I could sneak in just one P&L or balance sheet question for Roger, did the DSOs spike up a lot this quarter? And if so, can you give us a little detail on that?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, not based on our numbers, Shlomo. So I think in total in our numbers we're a little over 100 days this time. I think that's maybe a couple days higher than in the June quarter but not a big spike up.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Greg Peters", "I guess I just wanted to circle back. You gave some excellent color on organic. Can you speak to customer retention specifically in Corporate Risk & Broking and IRR, especially in light of some organic challenges that you are having there?", "John Haley", "Yes, our retention rate is in the low 90s, which is I think about what -- that's about the traditional rate. I think it's standard for that. I think where we've been seeing the pressure on the CRP is actually some new business wins haven't been as high as we might have hoped, and so that's been more the issue than the renewal rate, Greg, retention rate.", "Greg Peters", "So I'm just trying to marry that. Roger you said on your path to margin expansion for 2017 assumes organic growth. Just trying to parse out exactly what you mean by that. And then the follow-on to that, John, would be it doesn't seem like there's a lot of changes in the numbers with the third-quarter result that would represent new headwinds towards your 25% EBITDA margin target in 2018. But perhaps you could talk a little bit about anything that's changed from Analyst Day to now that might have adjusted your thinking.", "John Haley", "Yes, actually, thanks Greg for that. And I will let Roger maybe address that, but let me just address the sort of the macro point you raise there. We don\u2019t actually see anything in these results that have really changes our thinking from what we presented in Analyst Day. I mean when you look as I said at where we project our earnings will be this year, we are still right where we thought we would be at Analyst Day and actually we are even more confident that will be in the range we guided to. So we feel very good about that. The kinds of things, when we talked in Analyst Day we talked about what we needed to do to deliver in 2017 and then 2018. We knew that this 2016 had been a tough year and that it was going to continue to be a bit of a tougher year. But I think we feel like we have everything in place to get to where we need to in 2018. Roger, do you want\u2026", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I will just comment, Greg, on my words there and that they weren\u2019t intended to be profound words. It was actually more, and I don\u2019t say mathematics in front of John, it was arithmetic. But what really we challenged ourselves to do this quarter was step back and say do we start to see the seeds of momentum shift towards our margin expansion goal. And while we are still in this period of, one, having comparison, two big acquisition periods so that makes it a little difficult on a comparison side, and so the comparisons aren\u2019t really apples-and-apples, year-over-year. But we took a look sequentially at what we saw in the numbers and given the actions we know we\u2019ve taken this year. The path to margin expansion is continuing the kind of growth as we\u2019ve had this year, albeit at a low level, and then if sequentially costs are going down the way margin enhancement pops is you get to a quarter where you are comparing to a year where you began the cost reductions and revenues have been growing through that period and the margin enhancement pops. And so the only point I was trying to make is, and again with a lot of noise in the system and you have to adjust for things that are seasonal in nature, but we believe that we see a sequential cost-reduction momentum, which means that when we start comparing next year to 2016 that we would expect to see margin enhancement. So I didn\u2019t mean anything particular by citing organic growth, just saying that\u2019s the calculation.", "Greg Peters", "Perfect. Just a cleanup question on the tax rate, it\u2019s been running ahead pretty much all year of where you thought it would be. When do we start factoring in a lower tax rate for 2017 or 2018 or do we still keep it at the mid-20s?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, I mean, I think my view on tax is, one, there is enough complexity there is I don\u2019t like to declare victory on a year until you close the year out. So we are hopeful and as you can tell we dropped our guidance a bit this quarter, hopeful that we conclude that this kind of range is where we\u2019d like to see going forward and then maybe set a new goal. But I'd really like to close this year out before we talk about what 2017 and 2018 might look like.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Tunis", "Hey, thanks. My first question I guess is just on how to think about variable compensation. And I was wondering if in a year where organic is slower does that change the relationship of variable comp to revenues? In other words, is there margin expansion coming through this year in some shape or form because organic growth hasn't been quite what you guys thought it would be at the start?", "Roger Millay", "Maybe I will start with just a more numerical discussion and John might have some philosophical comments. So certainly we have incentive compensation programs across our businesses that are sensitized to performance and you can see in our numbers that the segments, there's a pretty broad diversity of performance in the segments. So there is a reduction at this point in incentive compensation, total dollars versus what the target amounts might be, and so we have had some adjustments over the last couple of quarters.", "In terms of getting where we are right now and getting to the end of the year and having a material impact on margins, I don't think those adjustments are at that level. I guess the other thing just in terms of the way the accounting works that I'd observe is what we called in Towers Watson discretionary compensation, which was a quite material item financially relative to a total year, it's not as material for Willis Towers Watson because there are more separate sales compensation programs in Willis Towers Watson. So, anyway, long and the short is pure bonus not as impactful as Towers Watson was, but there have been some downward adjustments and that's a part of that supported margins somewhat.", "John Haley ", "And I guess the only thing I would add about that is to say that we do have a pay for performance philosophy and we expect to pay our people better when results are good and not as well when results are not good. So we tend to maintain our variable compensation plans of all different stripes, when we add them altogether we come somewhere in the low 30s as a percent of our pretax pre variable comp margins. So they do adjust, but they actually don't tend to affect the margins themselves that much because they tend to be a constant percentage of that.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay. That's really helpful. Then I guess my follow up is just thinking about organic on the Reinsurance side, I think listening to John talk about these headwinds, it comes across as sounding environmental softness in North America Treaty Capital Markets. And I guess if you could just elaborate him why you think it's environmental as opposed to more broadly maybe some loss of market share, because when we look at competitors that are quite a bit bigger than Willis I guess in Reinsurance we are still seeing organic hold up reasonably well. So if you could just elaborate on why what gives you confidence that it's environmental at this point. Thanks.", "John Haley", "Yes so I think Reinsurance is a -- it's an interesting one. If we look at North America which is where we have experienced, I think, some of the biggest headwinds, we actually have exceeded our new business targets so far this year. So the new business part of it has gone relatively well. What has hurt us is A; there has been some of the existing clients are buying less reinsurance and so we've seen that occur partly because people are buying less reinsurance, partly because mergers have actually just taken, just cut the market in total, and then we've also seen, we've had a couple of clients that have restructured things, some of the reinsurance programs, which have led to revenues being shifted to different years. And we've seen that on a couple of big ones that have had a material impact on our results.", "When we look at it overall the Reinsurance, it does tend to be a little lumpy from year to year when we compare our results to we were looking at one of our big competitors the other day and they were minus 4% last year and they are plus 1% this year. So we had a better 2015 and a little bit lower 2016. I think we tend to look maybe at a little bit longer trends than just a year or so. But when we look at it we fundamentally are encouraged by the fact that the new business efforts have been strong even in North America and, in fact, have exceeded targets. And that is what makes us think going into 2017 we are well placed.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay and I guess one thought I had is the legacy Towers risk business that you guys kept when you sold the old Reinsurance business to JLT, have there been any revenue dissynergies in that business from I guess now bringing Willis Re back into the fold? Has there been softness do you think there that's at all related to merger, and how big is that revenue base for the legacy Towers risk business? Thanks.", "John Haley", "Yes, so I think no, there haven't been -- certainly there's no net revenue dissynergies and I don't think there have been really any revenue dissynergies to speak of. Interestingly enough, I referred in the script to businesses spontaneously working together. And I think it's the Reinsurance and the RCS business which have actually led the way in terms of doing that. So our Reinsurance folks have reached out to the RCS folks, have been adopting some of their models, have been using them in joint client presentations. And we've seen getting some synergies across business lines. Probably the poster child for that right now is our Reinsurance and our RCS folks. So we don't see a big difference there. Roger, what is the number on the size?", "Roger Millay", "I think with RCS is what $275 million, $300 million, something like that? That neighborhood.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay. Thanks for your answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Quentin McMillan with KBW. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Quentin McMillan", "I think one of the things, and I know you gave a lot of organic color that is confusing people, is just the change from what you saw as of September 29 at the Investor Day on the organic growth and the lowering of that. You were at 2% to 3%, you go to 2%. It's not a huge change but really just want to know what changed in the last 30 days and is that also related to your decision to change leadership at Corporate Risk & Broking post the Investor Day?", "John Haley", "So I'll let Roger talk about the numbers and how we got to that because it is a mix of a lot of different things. But let me just address the leadership changes. As we were looking out as to what we need to deliver in 2017 and 2018 I became focused on making sure I had the team that I had the most confidence in to deliver those results. And I made the changes to put that team in place. And so it wasn't anything specific about just one quarter, it was a matter of identifying the team that I felt the most confidence in.", "Roger Millay", "I would just say on the guidance question that even though Analyst Day was at the end of September, as you probably know in the CRB business there can be some big transactions that may or may not happen at the end of the quarter and in our forecasts, our internal forecasts which advise guidance, we had anticipated some larger transactions that would generate meaningful revenue for us and ultimately they did not come in by the end of the quarter. So CRB was the biggest piece of the miss in driving the reduction.", "Quentin McMillan", "That would sort of imply that the fourth quarter should be very strong because those contracts would have just rolled into the fourth quarter, correct?", "Roger Millay", "There are items that we hope for the third quarter that we now expect in the fourth quarter.", "Quentin McMillan", "And just shifting to the free cash flow, your 2018 guidance of 1.3 to 1.4, I just wanted to clarify one expectation for that. At the Analyst Day you guys did break out the $10, $10 EPS, you get there from 2.5% top-line growth, 25% EBITDA and 8 million decrease in shares. Is the free cash flow $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion number based on those same expectations or are there any differences in how you get to that free cash flow expectation?", "Roger Millay", "They are based on the same level and they are based on our belief at this point that free cash flow while balance sheet items go in there and there will be puts and takes year to year, but over time that free cash flow should fall into the range of adjusted net income. So the adjusted net income underlying $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion is consistent with the $10, $10 plus that we've talked about. And the $1.3 billion so, and it's to the exit rate of 2018 into 2019.", "Quentin McMillan", "Meaning you will finish 2018 with $1.35 billion or a roundabout in free cash flow?", "Roger Millay", "Well no, so the difference, so the big reduction or detractor from free cash today are all the restructuring and integration costs. We don't get out from under those until the end of 2018. So that's why, so the $1.3 billion to one $4 billion is saying, look, if you are running at a $10, $10 level for adjusted EPS, adjusted net income that underlies that and you are out from under the restructuring and integration costs then you\u2019re at $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.", "Quentin McMillan", "Okay, so the reported number will be lower but adjusted for the restructuring it should be that number? Okay. Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Mark Marcon", "I\u2019m just wondering if the some of the headwinds in CRB and IRR don\u2019t really abate, and let\u2019s say that revenue ends up being a little bit lower than the 2.5% in terms of getting to the 2018 target, how much room for adjustment? It seems like you have lots of different levers to pull in order to be able to still get to the 10, 10. Can you just talk about that a little bit?", "John Haley", "Yeah, I think I will let Roger will probably have some things to add to that, but I think, Mark, if you remember that slide we had from Analyst Day, one of the points of that was to show that there were a number of different levers, that if you grew at 2.5% then you had a 25% tax rate and you reduced 8 million shares you could get the 10, 10. If you grew it 4.5% then you had a 25% tax rate and you only reduced by if you\u2019ve got 2 million or 4 million shares you could still get the 10, 10.", "So what we were trying to illustrate is we did have a number of levers to pull. We tended to focus in that one on even at a relatively low growth rate we could still get to 10, 10 if we were buying back enough shares. but in addition to that we could, we didn\u2019t factor in what happens if our tax rate is better than we had suggested, for example, so we have a couple of different levers that we could pull.", "Mark Marcon", "Great. And then.", "John Haley", "Roger, do you want to?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah, just I will just add maybe another element of context, which is look every year one of the things we do, I would say, pretty thoughtfully is step back and say what are our best opportunities? As you said Mark, and I agree and John went through it, we do have a number of levers and we will continue to do that relative to shareholder value in general but then the specific targets that we\u2019ve set out. That\u2019s generally how we meet our commitments is adjusting with the times, finding the levers and executing on them.", "Mark Marcon", "Great. And then could you talk a little bit about some of the things that you think Todd and Carl will end up doing a little bit differently? I know it\u2019s early, obviously, but just in broad strokes here were some of the reasons behind the changes and some of the different executional elements that might go into reaccelerating growth in those areas.", "John Haley", "Well, so first of all, when Dominic indicated his intention to leave at the end of the year, we had to find a replacement for running IRR. And I think one of the things that we especially like about Carl, he had run the investment line of business for both Watson Wyatt and Towers Watson as part when he was running that, he was part of a leadership team in that segment. And at the time it included both Risk, Consulting & Software and the Reinsurance business that we had at Towers Watson. So Carl has some background in all three of those areas. I think the background he has in investment will serve him well in understanding the Capital Markets part of the business, also. Carl is one of the smartest people we have in the organization, and I think he will be a quick study on the other parts of the business too. So we liked his background. We like the fact that he has been involved with delivering high revenue growth in the areas he's been in, and he understands the importance of generating profitable revenue growth. So he was I think a very good fit for that.", "In terms of CRB and North America, as I mentioned in the script one of the things that I thought we needed more of a perspective on at the operating committee was our brokers. And by moving Todd who has a brokerage background and then putting Joe Gunn in charge of North America, we have increased some of that perspective on the operating committee and I think that will be very helpful. Both Todd and Joe I think are hard charging folks who understand what we need to do to build up the brokerage business in North America. And I think that's going to be one of their key focuses in the short run. And as I said earlier, I do think that this is a business that we probably have over complicated our structure a little bit, and I do think some streamlining is probably called for.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Kai Pan", "Good morning. Thank you. On your buybacks $300 million this year plus dividends probably close to $500 million and you have free cash flow generation about $650 million this year. I just wonder going forward was the free cash flow generation will be mostly used for shareholder returns?", "Roger Millay", "I think that one as we've said before we love to balance those two. We think certainly this year we are leaning to share repurchase. Returning cash to shareholders is very important to us and we think is appropriate at this point. And we are in the process right now of formulating our plans once we are complete with the $300 million. And I think in the short term we will be highlighting where we come out of that.", "John Haley", "But just as a matter of philosophy I think shareholder returns are what we probably see is the highest priority.", "Kai Pan", "Good. And then I just have a quick numbers question. On your presentation at Investor Day you mentioned that the integration cost will be about $150 million to $175 million in 2016. I'm assuming that will be mostly to achieve the $100 million to $125 million of cost synergy. Then you have about $100 million each year in 2017 and 2018. I just wonder are those additional restructuring costs and what kind of savings could coming from that?", "Roger Millay", "So there are various activities and I think we might have referred to this at Investor Day. Some of the actions that you take are short term and, I don't know, low-hanging fruit or whatever but very targeted and happened in the first year. Then some like things that require, let's say, combining systems, so finance and HR systems and the related technology, that's a multiyear project. So the benefits come in gradually and later in the integration period. Something like real estate, as well. While we have overlapping real estate it's best to execute those combinations when leases are closer to co-terminus. And so it's those kind of things that extend into '17 and '18, bigger process and technology changes and the real estate.", "Kai Pan", "Do you expect to generate additional cost savings over time beyond the $100 million to $125 million outlined.", "Roger Millay", "The 100 to 125 anticipated all those changes that I referred to.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. So the total cost is about $375 million, for the saving about $100 million to $125 million?", "Roger Millay", "Right. That's right.", "Kai Pan", "That sounds bigger than the normal restructuring cost of about 1.25 times.", "Roger Millay", "Yes, I mean some of it is, again, because you look at a project like an ERP project. There are some big changes that we're making as part of restructuring. Some of the real estate activities are quite expensive. So it's more than headcount-driven changes. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Brian Meredith", "A couple of questions. Roger, I was hoping to focus a little more on the expense side. Do you have an organic expense growth number on a year-over-year basis? If you factor out Gras Savoye what were expenses up on a year-over-year basis?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, I think it's about -- well, actually I don't have a year-to-date number. But I think for the full year we're anticipating organic expense growth in the neighborhood of the level of organic revenue growth. Pretty close.", "Brian Meredith", "Pretty close to it. Got you. Then on the OIP program, still on track to achieve the $230 million of cumulative savings in 2016? And then on that, how much do you think is flowing to the bottom line at this point?", "Roger Millay", "Well, the second question gets a little complicated but relative to all that's going on in the Company. But we are on track for the savings and the savings are realized. There's a very disciplined process to track both the exits as well as then how that relates to the additional folks that are added in Mumbai or elsewhere in the service centers. So those costs are quote, unquote dropping to the bottom line. Of course, as a result of both the shortfall in revenues versus what we expected and the plans that had been built for the year relative to that business momentum, that has certainly challenged our ability to show net margin expansion as a result of the savings that are going on, which is really I wanted to highlight that sequential cost momentum item that I talked about in my script. So while right now you see in the adjusted operating margin a little bit of increase it's not at all what you would expect based on the savings we are seeing in OIP plus merger. But we have been adjusting our expense levels all year as the year went by and we are now starting to see the results of that. In this 2017 planning period we continue to emphasize that, so we have our eye on the prize and we think we are starting to see the kinds of results financially that will lead to margin expansion, but we are not seeing it yet.", "Brian Meredith", "And the weaker-than-expected organic revenue growth, is it changing any of your thoughts as to how much needs to be reinvested back in the business to get that organic revenue growth going and maybe less falling to the bottom line of the OIP and the integration expenses?", "Roger Millay", "I will comment on the idea of investments and John may have a comment or two, as well. I think, and it's why we cite the shortfall to revenues. I think there are areas in the Company; I would say specifically the legacy Willis International business where there had been tremendous success I guess over the last few years at least in growing revenues organically. Certainly as they had targeted that and anticipated that it would continue they did have plans of continuing to add resources and invest relative to that momentum. It certainly has halted here this year. So we have been in the process of both pulling back what had been identified let's say as targeted investment initiatives but also pulling back the momentum of cost growth relative to prior organic growth momentum. So it's been a major discussion item. Again, it's a major planning item and we are pushing that hard to make sure that where we are investing it's in places where there's good visibility getting a payback. If there isn't then we are not going to do it.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please go ahead.", "Elyse Greenspan", "First off, is the currency impact that you guys are now, last quarter I think it changed to a $0.14 tailwind for the full year in terms of the EPS impact. What are you now expecting in terms of currency? I see the exchange rates you provided in guidance moved a little bit. And then also what was the currency impact on earnings in the third quarter versus what you are expecting for the fourth quarter?", "Roger Millay", "I think overall, so year to date the FX impact on EPS is now $0.11. I will say that relative to the $0.14 I don\u2019t think we had all of the hedging impacts in that $0.14. So the $0.11 is a refined number, and there was only a couple of cents in the third quarter.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay, so we will see most of the currency benefit at that point.", "Roger Millay", "Negative, yes, headwind.", "John Haley", "There was a couple cent headwind in the third quarter, just to be clear.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. And the tailwind will be in the fourth quarter?", "Roger Millay", "No. I don\u2019t know that we have the guidance in the guidance what the FX impact would be. We can follow up with you on that.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay, that would be great. And then just in terms of I guess you guys there was an earlier question in terms of some compensation changes that were variable comps this year given publicly the weaker organic. I mean how are you guys thinking about that in terms of just retention overall? There's been some high-level departures from legacy Willis organization that you guys have seen over the past year. So how are you balancing I guess may be lower comp this year versus your desire to want to retain most of the employees that you have on the platform now versus potentially seeing additional departures of people you might potentially not want to lose?", "John Haley", "Yeah, I mean, look I think we do have a pay for performance culture and we do pay people for results and I think we want to continue to do that. I think the people who are performing well will get compensated well, so we are not really too worried about that and I think we think we have the right kind of programs in place to incent the right kind of performance.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you very much. I think you had mentioned last quarter that the adoption rate for exchanges was accelerating in the middle market, larger companies are a little slow to adopt. Your language at least in terms of the growth you expect 4Q to be a little more moderate. How are you seeing the development of that market now?", "John Haley", "Yeah, so I don\u2019t think we see the market developing really any differently. I think the point about the quarter four is just that for all of us in the Exchange business quarter four is the quarter where we are all implementing. January 1 is when all the activity occurs, and so we are all focused on implementing and there is not as much effort on the sales then. We will have all of the open enrollment season for Medicare is from October to December. The folks who have are with employers that have a calendar year plan, which is most of them, all of that enrollment occurs during this fourth quarter. So it wasn't reflecting anything different about the market, just saying that most of our attention is on enrollment now.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Josh Shanker", "Yeah, thank you for taking my question. I just want to follow-up a little bit on again on the management. When we watched the Analyst Day on 9-30 I sort of assumed that Tim Wright and Dominic Casserley were the authors of the plan that was articulated for the traditional insurance brokerage type segment. Maybe that's an incorrect assumption to have. And given that we've seen 2% to 4% growth among your peers and probably about negative 2% at Willis, maybe the management change makes sense. I'm trying to figure out who's the author of the new strategy and why should we think that's going to work?", "John Haley", "I think the strategy that we presented at Analyst Day was one that reflected really input from the whole operating committee and where we thought we were going. And I don't think no strategy is ever just one person doing that. So I think there was a group that were focused on that and, frankly, as I said Dominic indicated his intent to leave, and so we did have to find somebody to replace him. The other changes that I made were really more about putting in place what I felt was the team that was best able to execute in 2017 and beyond given the strategy that we had already developed.", "Josh Shanker", "Did you already know these changes would be made at the Investor Day but it was too early to let us know that?", "John Haley", "No, if I had known the changes were going to be made I would have made them.", "Josh Shanker", "Okay. And the 2% organic growth for 2016 implies about 6% in the fourth quarter, without the JLT settlement you are at flat growth through nine months. It seems like a big haul to get 6% in the back half of the year. How confident are you on the 2% number?", "Roger Millay", "You are saying 6% in the fourth quarter to get that? That's not correct. Remember the 2%, this is total revenue growth so it does include the JLT settlement.", "Josh Shanker", "Yes, I can go through the math excluding I think you need about 8%, I get flat without JLT maybe 60 bps of growth with the JLT settlement. Maybe my math is wrong but I think it's going to be you are confident on the 2%, I guess?", "A - Roger Millay", "This is organic constant currency, remember. But, yes, the 2% based on the forecast and, of course, you have the segment guidance as well, so you don't find anything in there that's 6% growth.", "John Haley", "We are talking about growth for the Company as a whole.", "Josh Shanker", "Yes, I guess I will run the numbers again. I'm not quite there but that might be my bad math. I apologize.", "John Haley", "I think we have that right, Josh. But we can follow up with you.", "John Haley", "I think we are probably going to have to end this now. So thanks very much everyone for joining us this morning. And I look forward to talking with you at our fourth quarter earnings call in February.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Aida Sukys, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Aida Sukys", "Thanks, Kat. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Willis Towers Watson earnings call. On today\u2019s call are John Haley, Willis Towers Watson\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Roger Millay, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please refer to our website for the press release issued earlier today.

For a discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliation for non-GAAP financial measures under Regulation G to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the press release we posted on our website.", "After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the conference call for your questions. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thank you, Aida. Good morning, everyone. Today, we\u2019ll review our results for the first quarter of 2017 and discuss the 2017 outlook.", "Reported revenues for the first quarter were $2.32 billion, up 4% as compared to the prior-year first quarter. Adjusted revenues for the quarter were up 2% as compared to the prior-year first quarter. Reported and adjusted revenues include $50 million of negative currency movement. As a reminder, adjusted revenues for 2016 include $32 million of revenue not recognized due to purchase accounting rules for the prior-year first quarter. There were no adjustments made to revenue for the first quarter of 2017.", "For the quarter, adjusted revenues on an organic basis were up by 5%. Net income for the quarter was $352 million as compared to the prior-year first quarter net income of $245 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $708 million or 30.5% of revenues as compared to the prior-year first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $671 million or 29.6% of adjusted revenues.", "We\u2019re pleased to see year-over-year margin enhancement consistent with our goal. This is a testament to the work the team has done over the past year to both drive growth and drive the benefit of our cost-savings initiatives to the profit line.", "As a reminder, the first quarter is seasonally high, and while we are on track for our full year margin enhancement goal, margin in subsequent quarters is expected to be seasonally lower.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $2.50 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.71. Currency fluctuations, net of hedging, had a negative impact of $0.10 on adjusted diluted EPS.", "Before moving on to the segment results, I\u2019d like to provide an update on three areas of integration: revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. So I\u2019ll start with revenue synergies. Our merger objective identified three specific areas of revenue synergies: global health solutions, the U.S. midmarket exchange and large market P&C. It\u2019s early in the sales season for both the global and U.S. midmarket health care solutions to provide a lot of color around the sales process. However, we currently have a larger pipeline in our global health care solutions than this time last year, and are very pleased with the health care exchange activity in the U.S. midmarket.", "Finally, we won 8 large-company broker assignments this past quarter. These wins continue to produce moderate revenues, but we feel very positive about the progress we\u2019re making in developing key relationships and refining our marketing strategies in the U.S. large market P&C space.", "As mentioned previously, we surpassed our original goal of a 25% adjusted tax rate, a full year ahead of schedule. We\u2019ve already had a number of questions on President Trump\u2019s proposed tax plan. The current tax plan lacks details and we\u2019ll need to wait until the treasury drafts legislation to better understand its impact.", "Our 2017 guidance anticipated achieving $30 million in merger-related savings. We recognized more than $10 million in savings in the first quarter of 2017. We continue to feel very confident in meeting our 2017 savings objectives and achieving the $125 million 2018 savings goal.", "Now turning to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. We\u2019ve saved $12 million year-over-year through the first quarter on a run rate goal of $95 million as we exit 2017. This program remains on track to be completed at the end of 2017.", "We\u2019ve made good progress in driving OIP and merger-related savings to the bottom line. However, our focus on cost management remains a priority as this is a key factor for obtaining our 2017 and 2018 margin goals.", "One last note before turning to the segment results. I\u2019d like to make a comment regarding the announcement made last month that our U.K. brokerage subsidiary, Willis Limited, is under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority for possible agreements or concerted practices in the aviation broking sector. The aviation broking business contributes less than $100 million in annual revenue to our company. We are cooperating with the FCA but beyond that, we are not in a position to comment on the status of the investigation.", "Now let\u2019s look at each of the segments in more detail. As a reminder, beginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affected our segment results. These changes were detailed in the Form 8-K we filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017.", "For the quarter, total reportable segment constant currency commissions and fees growth was 5%. Constant currency commissions and fees for Human Capital & Benefits increased 5%, Corporate Risk & Broking increased 3%, Investment, Risk & Reinsurance increased 5% and Exchange Solutions increased 10%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.", "Turning to Human Capital & Benefits or HCB. HCB commissions and fees constant currency and organic growth was 5%. Retirement commissions and fees were up 3% as a result of increased actuarial project demand, primarily due to legislative changes in Great Britain and additional project work in Western Europe, along with the timing of the Easter holidays in both of these geographies.", "The Easter holidays were observed in the first quarter of 2016 but in the second quarter of this year. So we expect our second quarter to be somewhat softer than the first.", "North America also experienced revenue growth as a result of the continued phase in and of new pension administration clients.", "Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were down, primarily due to a decline in new business in North America and Great Britain. As discussed in the previous earnings call, implementation of our new organizational structure and restructuring took place during 2016, requiring internal focus in the second half of the year. However, with the restructuring behind us, we have additional market facing resources and a renewed focus on clients and sales. We expect to build towards growth as the year progresses.", "Health care consulting had strong commission and fee growth as a result of strong demand in the midmarket and large market globally. France and Spain placed a number of policies in the first quarter of 2017 that would have normally been placed later in the year, so we may see some softening later in the year. Technology and Administration Solutions or TAS continue to produce strong results due to new clients in the U.K. legislative changes I discussed earlier.", "We continue to have a positive outlook for the HCB business in 2017, but expect momentum to slow in the second quarter due to the timing issues mentioned above. We expect commission and fee momentum will then build in the second half of the year.", "Turning to Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB, constant currency and organic commissions and fees grew 3% from the prior year. Commissions and fees [increased] in all regions, except for North America. The international region led with strong performance primarily due to strong client retention levels and new business wins. The region\u2019s performance was also helped by regulatory changes which brought business forward into the first quarter. We also experienced solid growth in many of our Asian operations as a result of new business.", "Great Britain\u2019s commissions and fees increased due to growth in Construction. As you may recall, both international and Great Britain had low comparables in the first quarter of 2016 as the result of the cancellation of a large energy project. Western Europe grew as a result of retention in new business growth in Southern Europe and most notably, strong new business wins in France. Revenues declined in North America as a result of softness in new business and strong comparables in quarter one of 2016. Client retention stayed strong.", "The quarter results were helped by the timing of revenue into Q1 and we may experience a slowdown in growth rates in the second quarter. However, we continue to be optimistic about the momentum in our CRB business going forward. The investments we\u2019re making today, coupled with our analytical approach, will create a powerful proposition to help our clients manage their risks.", "Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance. Constant currency and organic commissions and fees increased 5% as compared to the prior-year quarter. The reinsurance line of business represents treaty-based reinsurance only. The facultative reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment. Reinsurance commissions and fees growth was the result of growth in international and specialty, offset by some softness in North America, which was in line with expectations. International benefit by positive timing of policy placement in specialty grew as a result of new business. Wholesale delivered growth as renewals were stronger than expected and a significant policy renewed in the first quarter of this fiscal year as compared to the second quarter of 2016.", "Risk Consulting and Software or RCS also experienced strong growth as the result of a greater demand for project work. We\u2019re now seeing traction from the hiring we\u2019ve done over the last 12 months and our updated marketing strategy.", "Investment commissions and fees increased as a result of increased performance fees and new wins in the delegated investment services business. While the advisory business grew this quarter, we anticipate a secular decline for these services, but offsetting this decline is an increased demand for delegated services. Max Mathiessen delivered strong growth due to higher performance fees as a result of a more robust European equity market and an increase in new business.", "We continue to feel good about the IRR business for 2017, but expect commissions and fees growth will moderate in the second quarter due to the positive timing related to the reinsurance and wholesale business. We also expect a decline in total segment revenues due to the fine arts and jewelry team settlement received in the second quarter of 2016.", "As a reminder, we received a onetime $40 million settlement, which was included in other revenues. This not only provides a very difficult revenue comparable, but the second quarter 2016 segment operating margin was enhanced by 8 percentage points.", "Lastly, Exchange Solutions commissions and fees increased by 10% from the prior year, driven by increased enrollments, our Retiree and Access Exchanges revenue increased 6%. The rest of the segment increased 16%.", "Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increase in our active employee exchange. The health and welfare and North American pension outsourcing business continue to grow, primarily due to new clients and special projects related to the ACA reporting requirements. Our 2017 sales pipeline continues to look strong especially in the midmarket. For the active exchanges, we also have 6 large clients with about 150,000 total lives that have already committed for the 2018 enrollment period and one large client committed for the 2019 enrollment period. However, we expect the midmarket to continue to adopt at a faster pace than the large companies. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth of this business.", "As you all know by now, Roger Millay will be retiring in October. So I\u2019ll provide my official congratulations to Roger next quarter. But I\u2019d like to say that Willis Towers Watson has been extremely fortunate to have Roger\u2019s experience and influence during the most crucial period of the merger. We\u2019re clearly seeing the impact of his leadership in these first quarter results.", "I also want to thank all of our colleagues who have worked so hard for the last year during some of the most difficult actions we had to undertake in this merger. I hope all of our colleagues are excited as I am about the great results this quarter. The quarter was strong across many lines of businesses and while we benefited from some timing issues, our first quarter results should give us all a clear perspective of the strength and potential of the organization we envisioned as we created Willis Towers Watson.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before getting to the results, I\u2019d like to congratulate John on his 40 years with the company. His accomplishments are too numerous to list here, but one fact really stands out. John took the helm as CEO of a private financially troubled company with a value of $120 million, almost 20 years ago. Since then, he\u2019s been masterfully creating shareholder value. He brought Watson Wyatt public, making it the first human resources consulting firm to do so, successfully led the creation of Towers Watson through a merger of equals and, ultimately, helped to create and lead Willis Towers Watson, which now stands at a market value of over $18 billion. John, I hope your next 40 years are as successful as your first 40.", "I also want to add my thanks and congratulations to all of our colleagues for producing a really great quarter. A lot of work has gone into this merger and integration. And much of the hardest blocking and tackling was accomplished last year. We built the initial foundation for strong financial discipline which will help us obtain our margin enhancement, growth \u2013 revenue growth and shareholder value creation objectives.", "Clearly, there continues to be work to do over the next two years, and we should expect some bumps in the road as we manage through the integration period. However, with the collaboration and the client commitment I\u2019ve experienced firsthand from our colleagues, I\u2019m confident in the long-term success of Willis Towers Watson.", "Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation.", "Income from operations for the quarter was $463 million or 20% of revenues. The prior-year first quarter operating income was $326 million or 14.6% of revenues.", "Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $681 million or 29.4% of revenues, and the prior-year quarter adjusted operating income was $646 million or 28.5% of adjusted revenues. Our momentum toward clear, consistent and sustainable profit margin growth continues. We like this trend.", "There was a $20 million increase in E&O expense during the first quarter of 2017. About half of this increase related to an expected settlement of one of the matters discussed in our SEC filings. The settlement will be discussed in more detail in our upcoming 10-Q filing.", "The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.6% and the adjusted tax rate was 15.6%. The lower adjusted tax rate quarter-over-quarter, contributed approximately $0.15 to the adjusted EPS.", "The first quarter generally produces the lowest tax rate for the year. The change in stock based compensation accounting policies added $0.01 to adjusted EPS.", "Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I\u2019d like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income for the prior periods in the Form 8-K we filed on April 7, 2017. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues.", "For the first quarter, the operating margin for the HCB segment was 37% compared to 34% in 2016. Margin enhancement was due to revenue growth, the restructuring which took place in late 2016 and general expense management.", "CRB had a 19% operating margin has compared to 17% in the prior-year first quarter. Revenue growth accounted for the increase in margin.", "For the quarter, Investment, Risk & Reinsurance had a 44% margin as compared to a 40% operating margin in the prior-year first quarter. The margin improvement resulted from increased revenues and expense management.", "Exchange Solutions had a 21% margin compared to 26% last year. Retiree and Access Exchanges and TAS led the segment with 37% and 23% operating margins, respectively. But both businesses experienced a drop in quarter-over-quarter margins. We invested resources into the retiree business to bring up service levels and as we phase in new clients in TAS, we often see a short-term decrease in margin.", "Moving to the balance sheet. We continue to have a strong financial position. During the quarter, the company refinanced its $800 million revolving credit facility and $218 million associated term loan, both due in 2018, with a new $1.25 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2022. Additionally, $394 million of the 6.2% notes matured in March 2017. The note repayment was financed using the new revolver as well.", "Assuming favorable market conditions, we expect to launch new long-term financing in the second quarter of this year. We plan to use the proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance of the current revolving credit facility.", "Free cash flow was $33 million in the first quarter, a decrease from $71 million in the prior-year first quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the full year payment of discretionary bonuses versus a half-year in 2016 for the former Towers Watson colleagues. We continue to focus on enhancing free cash flow in 2017.", "This quarter, we repurchased approximately $156 million of Willis Towers Watson stock. As of the end of the first quarter, the remaining stock repurchase authority was more than $975 million.", "Now let\u2019s review our guidance for 2017. In fiscal 2017, we continue to expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the 2% to 3% range. Constant currency and organic revenue will be closely aligned as we now have a full year of results for all of the 2015 acquisitions. However, we\u2019ve closed on two smaller transactions: the acquisition of the remaining shares of OAAGC in France and the acquisition of a small defined benefit group in Australia, which are not expected to be material to the overall 2017 guidance.", "We expect the adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the 23% to 24% range for the full year. As a reminder, the first quarter margin is seasonally high, and we expect seasonally lower margins as the year progresses.", "For segment revenues, we continue to expect low single-digit constant currency commissions and fees growth for HCB, CRB and IRR. Exchange Solutions should have commission and fee growth of approximately 10% with continued retiree growth, enhanced with good growth in TAS and the actives exchange. As a reminder, while we enrolled a record number of employees in the actives exchange, the revenues in this line of business are underweight compared to the retiree revenues.", "We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the 23% to 24% range. As a reminder, there were some onetime discrete items in 2016 that will not be repeated in 2017.", "Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.40 to $8.55. Guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.25 to the pound, and $1.08 to the euro.", "As I mentioned in the last call, 2016 was a year of building a new organization and developing a new focus on financial management. I believe the first quarter of fiscal 2017 shows that we built a foundation for financial success. And while we still have some hurdles to cross as we continue our integration efforts, I remain very optimistic about our long-term prospects.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Roger. Now, we\u2019ll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Hi, good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. John, it looks like a good quarter, a strong organic growth of 5% organic constant currency. There was a decent amount of commentary about some of the timing items. And just for us to get a sense as to what the underlying growth in the improvement over there, do you have a way to kind of tell us what it either quantitatively you\u2019ve calculated what it would be if you\u2019d normalize for some of those items or just your own gut sense, was this 4% organic, 3% organic? Or how should we look at it in terms of, if I would normalize for some of the timing? And then how should we think about that for the second quarter?", "John Haley", "Yes. So I think, Shlomo, as we think about this \u2013 so let me just say, first of all, we feel very confident. We had out there the guidance for the year of the 2% to 3%. And we look at this first quarter and we say, we think clearly we\u2019re on line to hit the 2% to 3% growth rate for the whole year. And in fact, if anything, we\u2019d expected to be at the higher end of that, rather than the lower end of that. So that\u2019s just about the overall. To the extent that timing affected things, it\u2019s \u2013 we haven\u2019t done an exact calculation of all of these, but it\u2019s probably, it makes it look like a more 4% quarter \u2013 in the 3% to 4% range somewhere there, as opposed to 5%. So I think as we \u2013 one of the reasons that we love this quarter because we talked about the first quarter being a time where we wanted to establish that the sort of turnaround that we had seen in the fourth quarter of 2016, that, that was really an inflection point. We like what this shows. We\u2019re just not ready to raise our guidance for the year yet though, simply because we think there was a little bit of timing that affected things.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Thanks. And then for my follow-up. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on what\u2019s going on in CRB in North America? That\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been a focus to try and improve the growth over there. That was still \u2013 sounded like it was a negative. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about pipeline or just where it feels like you are? And what we should expect for the balance of the year based on at least what you seeing now?", "John Haley", "Yes. As we said, for North America, we did see strong client retention levels. But the new business was not as robust as we would have liked. We are \u2013 we think we\u2019re \u2013 it had a tough comparison last year. You may remember last year, in the first quarter, North America was plus 4%. And so as we look at that, we have a tough comparable compared to that, the rest of the year was much lower for North America. We expect that, we have been repositioning our strategy, we\u2019ve repositioned some management. We feel very good about some of the new folks we\u2019re bringing on here. So we expect to see some growth as we get into the latter half of the year.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next session comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Crystal Lu", "This Crystal Lu in for Ryan. My first question is also just kind of around that organic growth timing. How far in advance did you know about the possible impact of the timing? And also, what are the impacts of the restructuring efforts on the organic this quarter?", "John Haley", "And so I think we knew about it as it occurred. I mean, that\u2019s - this was unanticipated bring forward a thing, so we didn\u2019t know about it. The only thing we might have known a little bit about was Easter. We had some sense that it would probably be a better quarter because of that. But most of the other things were just things that occurred. I\u2019m sorry, what was your second question?", "Crystal Lu", "Just around the restructuring impact on the organic as well.", "John Haley", "Roger, do you want to handle that?", "Roger Millay", "Well, sure. I think the main point that we referenced in the script was around the restructuring in Talent Rewards. And I think as John remarked in his script, we anticipate that as the year goes by, that impact will fade.", "Crystal Lu", "Okay. And then also on the organic expenses, I saw that the total segment expenses came down around 80 basis points year-over-year. Can you kind of help us think about the impacts of FX? And also, I guess just anything else that might have helped that organic expense number come down.", "Roger Millay", "I think as you point out, so certainly, foreign exchange would have an impact there. But also, again, the restructuring was a result of \u2013 were resulted in expenses being lower year-over-year. So it was the combination of those two things.", "Crystal Lu", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Mike Phillips", "Yes, thanks. It\u2019s Mike Phillips in for Kai Pan. Can you talk about share repurchase? Your first quarter looked like it was pretty strong and I think you had got it to about $500 million for the full year. Is that still in place? And any seasonality for the rest of the year or any kind of stock level that would kind of impact that as we go forward for the rest of the year?", "John Haley", "Yes. So we continue to attentively look at the intersection of business results and related cash flow on our share repurchase program. And we\u2019re on track for the roughly $0.5 billion that we talked about. And we\u2019ll continue to monitor that through the year, but we\u2019re on track.", "Mike Phillips", "Okay, thanks. And then if you could just provide just a little more elaboration on just the restructuring integration progress in terms of expense savings for your targets and how that\u2019s looking. You mentioned in your commentary, but if you could elaborate a little more on that, again, just the restructuring integration for expense savings for the year?", "Roger Millay", "Yes. I\u2019ll lead, I guess, on that. So really, we\u2019re pleased to say that at this point, we\u2019re on track for all of our targets, as noted in the remarks. And there has been a lot of activity, but we\u2019re on track. So it\u2019s going well. And we\u2019ll continue, obviously, to monitor it closely.", "Mike Phillips", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Your line is open.", "Adam Klauber", "Thanks. The \u2013 seems like throughout comments a number of divisions, the European businesses appear to be picking up. Is that true?", "John Haley", "Yes. We think we have very good momentum in Europe.", "Adam Klauber", "Okay. And that seems sustainable? Do you know? Again, you\u2019re seeing that throughout the first half?", "John Haley", "Well, we liked where the first quarter came out. And a number of our European businesses, a number of the countries were quite strong there. And so we would expect to see that \u2013 we\u2019d expect to see Europe have a good year.", "Adam Klauber", "Okay. And then on exchanges, we\u2019re hearing it\u2019s a pretty active selling season compared to last year. I guess, would you say that\u2019s true? And also you mentioned 150,000 lives in the larger active market. At this point, how does that compare to last year?", "John Haley", "It\u2019s the best large market sales we\u2019ve ever had.", "Adam Klauber", "Great. And how about the \u2013 is the selling season pretty active?", "John Haley", "Yes, I think the selling season is pretty active. I mean, I think one of the things, and this is particularly true of the large market, that you\u2019ll notice. You\u2019ll see, we have one large client that has committed to 01-01-2019 already. So the larger clients tend to have a longer timeframe from when they decide to go to when they implement. And that\u2019s because they\u2019re somewhat more complex and there\u2019s a lot more moving pieces in terms of doing them, but active sales season.", "Adam Klauber", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Mark Marcon", "Good morning. First of all, I\u2019d just like to pass along my congratulations to Roger, it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you over the years.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks very much, Mark. Same to you.", "Mark Marcon", "Thanks. Can you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing on the midmarket in terms of the exchange business? And then I have a follow-up.", "John Haley", "So I think, Mark, we\u2019re seeing a more active midmarket. I mean, I think we see it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a big growth in the number of clients last year. We saw a very large growth. We\u2019re seeing the same kind of thing occurring this year. I think the sales season for the midmarket as I was mentioning, it\u2019s just a longer sales season because there\u2019s a \u2013 we can \u2013 a midmarket client can decide to go later in the year, we can implement much faster than for the large company ones. But although we had this great growth, although we have this great results for the large market, we\u2019re still seeing much faster growth in the midmarket.", "Mark Marcon", "And are you seeing the full engagement of the Willis health insurance brokers in terms of facilitating that growth? Where would you say we are with regards to the level of execution relative to what you think the potential is?", "John Haley", "I would say that the major cause of the big increase in midmarket sales is in fact, the engagement that we have from the Willis side of the HCB. They\u2019ve been absolutely terrific in doing that.", "Mark Marcon", "Great. And then on a completely separate note, can you talk a little bit about where you think the bigger, the biggest incremental opportunities are for savings, among all the different cost programs that we have now on an annualized run-rate basis. You have so many, and we\u2019ve always seen some benefits, obviously. But kind of just lay them out.", "Roger Millay", "Yes, sure. And Mark, we don\u2019t necessarily rack and stack them in that sort of way. Maybe I\u2019ll just comment on things that are going to build momentum here this year. And one of the things you\u2019d note in John\u2019s remarks about the cost programs is increasing momentum, actually, in the second half of the year. And it\u2019s really the real estate activities as well as the technology activities that are building now and will be in execution mode as we end 2017 and begin 2018. So I think there\u2019s a lot of focus there right now.", "Mark Marcon", "Terrific, congratulations.", "Roger Millay", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Hi, good morning. My first question is just on your margins. I guess, it\u2019s a two-part question. So you guys reaffirmed your guidance, but said Q1 is stronger than the other quarters. Is that in reference to the Q1 on margin in totality or the level of margin improvement you expect on a quarterly basis? And my second point on the margin front. As you guys saw 90 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. If I look at the expense saves you gave, the merger savings and the OIP savings, I get about 100 basis points of margin just from your expense program. So I\u2019m a little surprised that a 5% organic that we\u2019re not seeing greater leverage on the margin front and more of margin improvement. If you can just talk to that as well?", "Roger Millay", "Sure. So relative, Elyse, to the seasonal patterns, we do have seasonality of margins. That is inherent in the business. So a strong seasonality of revenues in the first quarter, also reasonably strong in the fourth quarter. Those will tend to be higher margin quarters and the second and third, softer. The only thing I\u2019d say about what to expect in the pattern of margin enhancement that is of note and it came out in the script, that is the impact of the fine arts and jewelry settlement last year. So given that, that was in the GAAP earnings, that created a tough comparable for the second quarter, it really needs to be pulled out. So given that, we don\u2019t expect that same kind of growth in margin in the second quarter. I\u2019m sorry, can you repeat the second half of your question?", "Elyse Greenspan", "Yes. So the second part of the question, you guys reported 90 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the first quarter. If I add together the OIP savings that you alluded to in the quarter, the $12 million, plus $10 million of merger-related savings, the $22 million, gets me about 100 basis points of margin improvement from expense savings initiatives. So that would mean that there\u2019s actual margin contraction in your core business outside of just the savings coming to the bottom line. I\u2019m just a little bit surprised, if you saw 5% organic revenue growth in the quarter, a strong number. We\u2019ve seen other brokers expand their margins at a greater level, at a lower level of organic revenue.", "Roger Millay", "Yes. Thanks for that, sorry for blanking. But the thing I\u2019d point out relative to that question is \u2013 and it\u2019s really the reason we I pointed it out \u2013 the E&O related activity of about $20 million this quarter. So that really, it\u2019s all at one-time or whatever, episodic type expense that won\u2019t continue of that level. And that was again, driven largely by a particular settlement that we booked this quarter. So that really offset the savings, but won\u2019t repeat in the next few quarters.", "Elyse Greenspan", "And that comes out in the unallocated expense line?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, it does. Yes.", "Elyse Greenspan", "And then if I could also follow-up on the organic revenue growth in the quarter. So you guys reported a 5%, in response to an earlier question, you said maybe more in the 3% to 4% range, ex timing. Q1 is \u2013 when you write, when you book the majority of your revenue, strongest revenue quarter. So if you\u2019re thinking, if you\u2019re leaving your guidance at a 2% to 3%, my math will translate into something of about 1% organic growth over the next three quarters to hit that target. I understand the timing difference between the Q1 and the Q2. But if you are optimistic about the second of the year and some of the initiatives in some of your segments that you alluded to in the prepared remarks, why not raise on the organic growth outlook today?", "Roger Millay", "Well, again, and I think John might have alluded to it in some of his comments and he might want to make more here. But one, the timing, I would say, is of course, quite real here and there were specific transactions. And they did pull some of what otherwise would have been growth in the second quarter. And particularly, the specific transactions that John alluded to. So we\u2019re on track for the kind of overall momentum that we expected for the year. As John said, probably looking more towards the top of the range. And I haven\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know yet, I think your 1% calculation might be to get to the bottom of the range. But we feel good about where we are and what we thought for the year, and it would be early to change that.", "Operator", "And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to John Haley for any closing remarks.", "John Haley", "Okay. Great. Thanks very much, everyone, for joining us this morning, and I look forward to talking to you at our second quarter earnings call in August.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thank you, Aida, and good morning, everyone. Today, we\u2019ll review our results for the second quarter of 2017 and discuss outlook for the remainder of 2017. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.95 billion, that\u2019s flat as compared to the prior year second quarter, up 2% on both a constant currency and organic basis. Adjusted revenues for the quarter declined 1% as compared to the prior year second quarter, but were up 1% on both the constant currency and organic basis. Reported and adjusted revenues include $43 million of negative currency movement. As a reminder, adjusted revenues for the second quarter of 2016 include $26 million of revenue, which was not recognized as GAAP revenue due to purchase accounting rules. The second quarter of 2016 was the last quarter for such adjustments.", "As a reminder, the $41 million settlement we received from JLT for the Fine Arts and Jewelry business was included in the second quarter 2016 revenues. In the second quarter of 2017, we received $6 million in settlement payments, primarily related to the loss of a team in South Florida.", "As we mentioned in the first quarter, revenues were positively impacted due to the timing of the Easter holiday, timing of renewals and work that derived from regulatory changes. Therefore, in reviewing the results, our six month results more accurately reflect the business momentum. For the first half of 2017, reported total revenue growth was 2% as compared to the same period in the prior year, and up 4% on both the constant currency and organic basis. Adjusted revenues for the first half of 2017 increased 1% as compared to the same period in the prior year, up 3% on both a constant currency and organic basis. Adjusted revenues for the first half of a 2016 include $58 million of revenue not recognized due to purchase accounting rules. Reported and adjusted revenues include $93 million of negative currency movement for the first half of the year.", "Net income for the quarter was $41 million as compared to the prior year's second quarter net income of $76 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $387 million or 19.8% of revenues as compared to the prior year second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $406 million or 20.6% of adjusted revenues. Net income for the first half of 2017 was $393 million as compared to the same period and the prior year net income of $321 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2017 was $1.10 or -- sorry, $1.1 billion or 25.6% of revenues as compared to the first half in the prior year adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion or 25.4% of adjusted revenues.", "As a reminder, the first quarter is seasonally strong and margin is seasonally lower in subsequent quarters. As expected, the second quarter margin came in softer than the first. In addition to the seasonality, the 2016 JLT settlement negatively impacted margin comparison by 2 percentage points. While the second quarter margin enhancement may be masked somewhat by the JLT settlement, we're very pleased with our efforts this quarter with expense management.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.24 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.45. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a negative impact of $0.06 on adjusted diluted EPS.", "Before moving on to the segment results, I'd like to provide an update on 3 areas of integration: revenue synergies, cost synergies and tax savings. I'll start with revenue synergies. Our merger objective identified 3 specific areas of revenue synergies: global health solutions, the U.S. REIT market exchange and large market P&C. We've already achieved approximately 46% of our 3-year global health solutions synergies sales goal, and the sales pipeline continues to be robust. Integrated global management of employee health benefits brings a clear value-add to our clients, and that is showing through in the results of our sales effort. It's still a bit early to make any conclusions on the mid-market exchange progress as the sales season continues into November. However, we have a strong sales pipeline as we see the interest in the mid-market maintaining the momentum we experienced last year.", "Finally, we've won 18 large company P&C broker assignments in the first half of this year. We've been refining our marketing strategy into a more targeted approach and are pleased with the number of wins we've had to date. Our win rates in the large market are somewhat higher than the mid-market, but there are fewer proposals in the large market. While the initial wins are generating modest revenues, we feel positive about the development of key relationships, which we hope to expand on in an effort to help us achieve our long-term growth objectives.", "As we mentioned previously, we surpassed our original goal of a 25% adjusted tax rate a full year ahead of schedule. Our 2017 guidance anticipated achieving $30 million in merger-related savings. We continue to feel confident in achieving our 2017 savings objective and the overall savings goal of $125 million as we exit 2018.", "Now turning to the Operational Improvement Program or OIP. We continue to anticipate generating an additional $95 million of savings as we exit 2017. Most of the benefits associated with the saving program will impact 2018, and many of these programs are weighted to the second half of 2017. The program remains on track to be completed at the end of 2017. We continue to see progress in driving OIP and merger-related savings to the bottom line, but cost in margin management will remain a priority.", "Now let's look at each of the segments in more detail. As a reminder, beginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affected our segment results. These changes were detailed in the Form 8-K we filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017. For the quarter, total segment constant currency commissions and fees grew 2%. Constant currency commissions and fees for Human Capital & Benefits increased 1%; Corporate Risk and Broking increased 1%; Investment, Risk & Reinsurance increased 3%; and Exchange Solutions increased 15%. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commission and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.", "So turning to Human Capital & Benefits or HCB. Commissions and fees constant currency growth was 1% and organic growth was flat. For the first half of the year, on an organic basis, HCB commissions and fees growth was 3%. As I mentioned earlier, due to the timing of Easter and early renewals, comparing the first half results year-over-year is a better indicator of business momentum than quarter-over-quarter.", "Retirement commissions and fees were down by 2%. Great Britain experienced strong growth this quarter, however, was offset by declines in Western Europe due to the timing of Easter and in North America, as a result of lower demand for both lump-sum projects. The growth in Great Britain was a result of increased actuarial project demand, primarily work relating to legislative changes.", "Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were down 1%, primarily due to a decline in new business in North America with an overall increase of commissions and fees in the three other regions. As we discussed in our previous earnings call, the implementation of our new organizational structure and restructuring impeded our market focus at the end of last year. We're still on track to generate growth as the year progresses and have already seen progress in our new business efforts, with steady increases in our pipeline each month.", "Health and Benefits have a strong commission and fee growth as a result of increased service to large market clients in North America, implementation and expansion of our global benefit management for multi-national clients and strong client retention in new business outside North America. Notably, timing of renewals in France and Spain created some softness in Western Europe for the quarter, though the year-to-date growth was nearly double-digit.", "Technology and Administration Solutions or TAS continue to produce strong results globally as we on boarded new clients in Great Britain and Western Europe and provided additional support to existing clients with respect to the UK legislative changes I mentioned earlier. As a side note, HCB revenues included a $5 million settlement related to the departure of Health and Benefits Brokerage teams. As you may recall, the company recognizes brokerage team settlements as revenues, which are included in adjusted earnings. We continue to have a positive outlook for the HCB business in 2017.", "Now, turning to Corporate Risk and Broking or CRB. Constant currency and organic commissions and fees were up 1% as compared to the prior year. For the first half of the year, CRB grew 2%. Commissions and fees growth was led by Great Britain, with wins in transportation, financial lines and natural resources. Western Europe up had solid growth, primarily led by Ireland and Iberia. Additionally, international experienced solid growth in Asia and Latin America, but experienced some softness related to the accelerated timing of policy placements and renewals in the first quarter due to regulatory changes. Commissions and fees declined in North America as a result of several large, onetime projects booked in 2016 as well as unfavorable rate and risk exposure changes.", "New business levels continued to grow as expected, and client retention stayed strong. We continue to be optimistic about the momentum in our CRB business going forward as we expected North American revenues to build in the second half of the year.", "Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance. Constant currency and organic commissions and fees increased 3% as compared to the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the Reinsurance line of business represents premiums based reinsurance only. The facultative reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment. Reinsurance commissions and fees growth was a result of strong new business in international and favorable timing in specialty and in North America. Wholesale was soft in the second quarter due to the timing of renewals booked in the first quarter, which had been booked in the second quarter in the prior year. For the first half of 2017, wholesale commissions and fees grew by 4%.", "Risk Consulting and Software or RCS also experienced strong growth as a result of greater demand for project work in EMEA and software sales. Investment commissions and fees increased as a result of new delegated investment clients and increased performance fees. Max Matthiessen delivered strong growth due to higher performance fees as a result of new business and a more robust European equity market.", "As a reminder, we received a onetime $41 million settlement for the fine arts and jewelry business in the second quarter of 2016. As expected, we had a decline in total segment revenues due to this large onetime event. This also enhanced the second quarter 2016 segment margin by 8 percentage points. We continue to feel very positive about the momentum of the IRR business for 2017.", "And lastly, Exchange Solutions. Commissions and fees increased by 15% from the prior year. Driven by increased enrollments, our retiree and access exchange revenue increased 14%, and the rest of the segment increased 17%. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increase in our active employee exchange. The Health and Welfare in North American Pension Outsourcing business continue to grow, primarily due to new clients and customized active exchange projects. As the active exchange market evolves, we\u2019re seeing the work we do for our clients split between the exchange and the administration teams, as well as all our health and benefits lob.", "As large companies make the initial move to exchanges for health benefit delivery, they\u2019re opting for a more customized approach. The benefits administration group is currently more effective at providing this customization, as our outsourcing clients have unique requirements. As we move towards the 2018 enrollment period, it will become increasingly difficult to separate active exchange revenues from administration revenues and H&B revenues as we see these three groups working in collaboration with each other.", "Our 2018 active sales pipeline continues to look strong in both the mid-market and large market. As we mentioned in our previous earnings call, we have 6 large clients with about 150,000 total lives that have committed for the 2018 enrollment period and 1 large client committed for the 2019 enrollment period. The mid-market sales season will not be finalized until early November. Our channel brokers are keeping pace with prior year sales. The retiree exchange enrollment process is changing somewhat for 2018. We're seeing enrollments more evenly spread throughout the year, with a slight bump in enrollments in the fall of 2017, and the sales season is continuing as some larger companies are contemplating off-cycle enrollments.", "We're also seeing an impact from the current health care debate, and yet there are some clients who have held off this year until there is more clarity. Now while ACA doesn't generally impact Medicare retirees, it has a significant impact on the pre-65 retirees, and many companies are looking for a coordinated solution for both groups. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth of this business.", "So I'm excited to see the progress we've made in building Willis Towers Watson, not only evidenced by our first half results, but with the commitment of our colleagues as well. We recently received the results of our employee engagement survey, and I was most impressed with a couple of factors. First, the response rate was higher than we'd anticipated. This, alone, highlights to me that we have strong colleague engagement across the globe. Second, we scored very well in the areas that are key to our long-term success, such as positive responses relating to colleagues who are proud to be part of Willis Towers Watson, strong alignment to our values, colleagues who believe in our commitment to inclusion, having an environment where we value differences and colleagues who feel supported by their managers. We've also identified areas that need more focus as we work through our company's evolution and integration, but we now have a clear roadmap to move forward.", "I'm extremely proud of our colleagues, all 42,000, who've been instrumental in creating Willis Towers Watson. We've been given a unique opportunity to build an organization which reflects our values and a strong client commitment and also provides distinctive, integrated market-leading solution. The changes we have experienced in the last 18 months have been significant. I believe the financial results for the first half of this year reflect the engagement and commitment of our colleagues. As we move forward through the integration process, we can now shift greater focus to the market and build on the fundamentals of a merger strategy, which we believe will create more value for our clients, colleagues and shareholders. Based on what we've accomplished in the first 18 months, I'm excited as I look forward to the progress we can make together in the next 18 months.", "On a bittersweet note, this may be Roger's last conference call. And I say, maybe his last call, as Roger has been very gracious to remain flexible to ensure a smooth transition with a new CFO. Roger joined Watson Wyatt, a $2 billion company, just before the merger of equals that created Towers Watson. He played a key role in shaping that business and in enhancing the financial profile of the company. There were a host of acquisitions and mergers along the way. Perhaps, one of the most significant acquisitions, Extend Health, brought us the advent of the exchange business. Then, about 2 years ago, Roger was asked to take on the challenge of yet another merger of equals with the creation of Willis Towers Watson. As Roger retires from Willis Towers Watson, he leaves behind a $20 billion organization.", "We've experienced a great deal of change in Roger's tenure as CFO, but some things have remained rocksteady, such as Roger's pragmatic counsel and his desire to win. I want to thank Roger for his many contributions, guidance and his partnership over the last several years and hope that he and Robin have a long, healthy and rewarding retirement.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Roger.", "Roger Millay", "Well, thanks, John for those very nice, kind words. And good morning to everyone. Before getting to the results, I'd also like to comment on my retirement. I have had some of the best experiences of my career as CFO of Willis Towers Watson. It's really been an honor and a pleasure to work with a group of such bright and innovative people. And more importantly, people with such deep values and strong sense of commitment to their colleagues, clients and value creation. I've truly entered the challenges, the success and, most of all, the journey. Thank you for the opportunity to share in that experience.", "As I leave Willis Towers Watson, I feel confident that the team will continue the journey to even greater heights. In addition, I\u2019ve really enjoyed the opportunity to participate in the capital markets and all the back and forth that entails, over time, and the relationships that were built as a result.", "Now for our financial results. As a reminder, our segment margins are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs, such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions. The segment results include discretionary compensation. Income from operations for the quarter was $124 million or 6.3% of revenues. The prior year second quarter operating income was $136 million or 7.0% of revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $363 million or 18.6% of revenues, an increase over the prior year quarter adjusted operating income of $357 million or 18.1% of adjusted revenues.", "The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.8% and the adjusted tax rate was 29.1%. As we discussed last quarter, the first quarter tax rate is generally the lowest of the year. As expected, after reiterating our 2017 tax guidance of 23% to 24% in our last earnings call, we experienced a significant increase in the tax rate for the second quarter. Our first half tax rate is on plan. I would also like to address one point regarding the other expense and income line on our income statement. This quarter we had a $30 million expense on this line versus $6 million of income in Q2 '16. This variance is primarily due to a favorable balance sheet re-measurement in the prior year and greater operational FX hedging cost in 2017.", "Before we discuss the segment operating margins, I'd like to remind you that we provided recast segment operating income with the prior periods in the Form 8-K we filed on April 7, 2017. Additionally, our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues. In Q1, HCB, CRB and IRR all experienced very strong revenue performance, some of which was timing related, and the corresponding increase in operating margin. In Q2, these businesses had dampened margin results due to the Q1 timing factors as well as a very difficult Q2 2016 comparative in the case of IRR. Overall, these businesses continue to perform well in managing cost levels to drive margin enhancement.", "For the second quarter, the operating margin for the HCB segment was 17%, flat to the prior year. Despite a drop in reported revenues, margins stayed level due to the restructuring which took place in late 2016 and general expense management. For the first half of 2017, operating margin was 28% as compared to 26% in the prior year. The CRB segment had a 16% operating margin, flat to the prior year. As a result of cost management, the second quarter margin remained flat despite the annual pay increases as of April 1 and planned phase in of expense allocations related to acquisitions.", "For the first half in 2017, operating margin was 17% as compared with 16% in the prior year. For the quarter, the IRR segment had a 25% operating margin as compared to a 29% margin in the second quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the $41 million JLT settlement enhanced the IRR segment Q2, 2016 margin by 8 percentage points. Excluding the impact of the settlement, the 2017 margin would have been almost 4 points higher year-over-year. The first half 2017 operating margin was 36% as compared to 35% in the prior year, including the JLT settlement.", "The Exchange Solutions segment had a 19% operating margin as compared to 22% in the prior year second quarter. The benefits administration business was primarily responsible for the decline in margin. As we prepare for the 2018 healthcare enrollment season and continue phasing in new clients, compensation expenses ramp up to prepare for the enrollment, and revenues are deferred until projects go live. The first half of 2017 operating margin was 20% as compared to 24% last year. This decline was anticipated as strong growth typically dampens operating margin on a temporary basis.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a strong financial position. In May, we issued $650 million -- a $650 million seven year note with a coupon of 3.60%. The proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding balance of the current revolving credit facility. Free cash flow for the first half of 2017 was $200 million an expected decrease from $344 million for the first half of the prior year. The decrease was driven by higher capital expenditures, changes in working capital and increased discretionary bonus payments. As a result of the merger, the legacy Towers Watson colleagues experienced a change in fiscal year, which resulted in a partial year payout of bonuses in 2016. We continue to focus on enhancing free cash flow in 2017.", "This quarter, we repurchased approximately $140 million of Willis Towers Watson stock, bringing the total for the year to $296 million. As of June 30, 2017, the remaining stock repurchase authority was approximately $837 million.", "Now let's review our guidance for 2017. We continue to expect constant currency revenue growth for the year to be in the 2% to 3% range. Constant currency and organic revenue will be closely aligned as we now have a full year comparative results for all of the 2015 acquisitions. This guidance includes the impact of the divestiture of the Charles Monat business, or Global Wealth Solutions, which closed in July.", "We expect the adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the 23% to 24% range for the full year. As a reminder, the first quarter margin is seasonally high, and we expect seasonally lower margins as the year progresses. For segment revenues, we continue to expect low single-digit constant currency commissions and fees growth for HCB and CRB. We're increasing the IRR commissions and fees expectation to a range of low to mid-single-digit growth. Exchange Solutions should have commissions and fees growth of approximately 10%, with good growth in the benefits administration and the actives exchange, supplemented by moderated growth in retiree.", "Integration costs are expected to approach $200 million for the year. The expected increase in cost related to enhancement of the global benefit solution platform, the cost of shareholder lawsuit related to the merger, and balance sheet provisions related to operational harmonization. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the 23% to 24% range. As a reminder, there were some onetime discrete items in 2016 that will not be repeated in 2017. We expect the adjusted tax rate in the second half of the year to be similar to the Q2 '17 adjusted tax rate. In 2016, our discrete item benefits were concentrated in the second half of the year, so the third and fourth quarter tax rates of 2016 should not be considered a good benchmark for the second half of 2017.", "Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.36 to $8.51. The guidance range has dropped by $0.04 due to the divestiture of the Global Wealth Solutions business, which was sold in July. Annual guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.28 to the pound and $1.13 to the euro. We also expect approximately $20 million to $25 million of expense associated with our FX hedging programs in the second half of the year. This expense flows through other expense and income, below the income from operations line. The hedging program excludes the potential impact for balance sheet movements.", "I believe the results for the first half of 2017 indicate the continued progress of our integration efforts and the ability of our colleagues to adapt to change. This is a testament to the strong collaboration of our colleagues and our unrelenting client focus. Every dynamic organization must adapt to ever-changing global markets, political and economic risks, and most importantly, for Willis Towers Watson, our clients' needs. As I've watched the integration progress and our ability to adapt to change becoming stronger and stronger with each quarter, it gives me great confidence in the long-term success of the company. I've been very proud to be part of this unique opportunity, and I wish all of our colleagues the best of luck and much success. And now I'll turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Roger. And now we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.", "Greg Peters", "Good morning. Before I begin with my two questions, congratulations on your retirement, Roger. Certainly enjoyed talking with you through the years.", "Roger Millay", "Great. Thank, Greg, and have enjoyed working with you as well, certainly.", "Greg Peters", "Obviously, there's a lot of questions I have around the release. But why don't I zero-in on to, John, in your comments, you mentioned, I think, $94 million, $95 million of OIP savings. Is that what you expect to fall for the bottom line or is that just a general savings? I know, in the past, we've been challenged to figure out how much of that actually falls to the bottom line?", "John Haley", "Yes. I think that's the amount of gross savings that we expect to come out of OIP, Greg. I think as Roger and I have talked about in the prior calls, one of our big focuses is to make sure that we get the bulk of that dropping to the bottom line. But we don't -- we don't have numbers for that until we get our 2018 guidance.", "Roger Millay", "Maybe, Greg, just to add to that, because as John alluded to, we're most focused on margins. So as we look at the first half of the year and the enhancement of operating -- adjusted operating margin, that's where we look to see if the savings, both for integration and for OIP, whether they're impacting the company, which is why I spent the time I did going through the first half margins.", "John Haley", "Yes. I mean, and just to maybe emphasize that, if you look at the first half margins, in HCB, it's up from 26% to 28%; CRB, it's up from 16% to 17%; IRR was up from the 31% to 32% range, without the JLT settlement to 36%; and Exchange Solutions was down a little bit due to growth from 24% to 20%. But we're seeing a lot of these things drop to the bottom line this year already and we expect to see that continue next year. But that's where our push is going to be.", "Greg Peters", "Right. And then as it relates to the OIP, is there savings that -- are you going to come when some of the reinvestments that were made previously expire and are not remade? Does that make sense to you?", "John Haley", "Yes, it does. I think -- we haven't actually gone back and examined all of the different reinvestments that were made with some of the OIP things. And so I think I don't want to make a blanket statement about how these things are going to be. I think one of the things that we're very much focused on going forward is making sure that we prioritize and rationalize all of the investments we have within the company. And we're embarking on some new investments today. We're consolidating some old ones and we're eliminating some old ones. And so, we're doing all of that and we expect them all to pay off in the future.", "Roger Millay", "And I think, also, just in our planning approach last year rather than go back and try and figure out history and make kind of tactical decisions based on what had happened in the past, we think that by putting emphasis, going forward, in the organization on margin enhancement, the prioritization process will naturally come out. If there were investments, two, three years ago that aren\u2019t paying off, that, that\u2019s where people will go to enhance margins. If those investments were working, then they\u2019ll go somewhere else. So, that\u2019s the \u2013 we thought the most productive approach.", "Greg Peters", "Thanks for that color. Now, my second question was just around tax. It is moving around a little bit and I know you cited two numbers: the 16.8% and the 29.1%. Can you give us some additional color around what\u2019s causing all the movements within the tax rate? And what sort of the long-term targets are?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. So maybe, kind of do a macro thing first and then a little bit on the seasonality. So, we continue to view this kind of range that we\u2019ve talked about, 23% to 24% as being the landing point from a run rate, without any discrete items of where Willis Towers Watson began its life, so to speak. And last year, as you know, we came in a bit lower than that because of discrete benefits that we talked about last year and that I talked about in my remarks.", "And so we particularly wanted to highlight this quarter that those discrete benefits last year came mostly in the second half of the year. So, when you step back from the tax rate, and if you\u2019d seen last year, without those discrete benefits, the first quarter, we expect going forward will be below mark for the adjusted tax rate. And then quarters two, three, and four will be higher. And it is kind of unfortunate the way the dynamics of the accounting work between the operating results and the adjusting items, but because the adjusting items are in higher tax locations, when you add those back, they add to the tax rate, so that\u2019s what you see between the GAAP rate and the adjusted rate. But also then, in periods of lower operating profitably, you get this big spike, so that\u2019s what you get in quarters two, three and four. So I think that\u2019s going to be the trend, and I think this year, it\u2019s looking like the quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter rates are going to be pretty true to that trend.", "Charles Peters", "And just on the follow-up on that point. When I think about -- push aside the first quarter estimate or results, when I think about the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, how much variability will we see in the tax rate on a go-forward basis between those 3 quarters?", "Roger Millay", "So we would expect -- and this is without getting into predicting kind of plus or minus one point, or maybe even plus or minus two points, but the high 20s rate that we came in for the second quarter, we would expect to be in the higher 20s in the third quarter and fourth quarters as well. I mean and if you do the arithmetic for 23% to 24% versus where we are for the first half, that\u2019s what you get as well.", "Greg Peters", "Perfect. Thank you for your answer.", "Roger Millay", "Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of the Ryan Tunis from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open", "Crystal Lu", "This is Crystal Lu, in for Ryan. My first question is on the constant currency growth guidance. I think last quarter, you guided to the high end of the two to three full year revenue growth range. And you said that organic growth was expected to accelerate in the second half of the year. We've now achieved about 3% in the first half, but you still maintain the 2% to 3% guide. Are you no longer expecting that growth acceleration in the second half?", "John Haley", "No. I don't think -- we weren't saying anything different, I think, than what we've said in the first half of the year. So what we said after the first quarter was we maintained our guidance at 2% to 3%, and I think, then, in a question, somebody asked and we said \"Well, we're more likely to be at the high side of that.\" I think if you asked the question today, I'd say, \"Yes, we're more likely to be at the high side of that.\" We think our outlook is pretty much where it had been. Maybe it's even a little more positive after the whole strong first half. But we don't think there's anything that's calling for us to necessarily raise our guidance now, but we feel very encouraged by the results of the first half.", "Crystal Lu", "Okay, great. And then also, John, in your comments in the press release, you alluded to reaching the full potential. And we were just wondering if this full potential refers to achieving that $10 EPS 2018 target discussed before at the Investor Day, or it refers to some other metrics of the company?", "John Haley", "Yes, let me just pull up the press release here. So, I'm sorry, I just had to take a quick look at that to refresh my mind. When I was talking about that, I was actually talking about the much broader thing. And I think, as we talk to our colleagues and to our investors and our analysts, there's 2 things we focus on: one is, some of the short-term commitments that we made, relatively short-term commitments we made when we were trying to do the deal as to what we were going to work on, and those are around the synergies, those are around the -- achieving some of those results. And those have -- those are very important to us. We take commitments we make to our colleagues and to investors seriously, so we want to make sure we live up to them. But frankly, when we think about the vision of what we can create at Willis Towers Watson, and what we can do in the longer run, that's much greater than the short-term commitments, and that's what I was referring to in the press release.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Before I ask my questions, just to make a point of when you went through the litany of things you put Roger through over the last 10 years, you sounded like you just flat-out wore him out.", "John Haley", "Roger is shaking his head vigorously, yes.", "Roger Millay", "He's quite the task master, so...", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "John, could you just talk a little bit more about the Corporate Risk & Broking. In North America, the commentary was the revenue was flat, you had tough comps year-on-year because of some projects. Could you just talk about, sometimes there's movement between quarters and then, sometimes there's a talk about what does it feel like you're growing at, just in the general sense? Can you make some commentary about that in North America?", "John Haley", "Yes, so I think, and Roger, you may want to add to this, too, but I think the -- we had a few really large projects that we had worked on last year in 2016 that we knew were not going to be repeating. And, let me just, we had\u2026", "Roger Millay", "There's some big real estate projects, and particularly, things in the Northeast.", "John Haley", "Particularly big things in the Northeast. And so in the second quarter of 2016, we had 6 accounts over $500,000 and it was a total revenue of nearly $4.6 million. And we knew that these were big projects that weren't necessarily going repeated, or well just weren't going to repeat. In quarter two, we have two accounts that are $1.8 million there. So there's a bit of a decline there. But if we just step back from those and look at the business overall, I think we're pretty optimistic about the rest of the business and what is going on there. So as I said in the script, we feel pretty good about the momentum in the CRB business going forward and in particular, I called out North America as a place where we expect the revenues to build in the second half of the year.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Okay. So you feel like you're in an upswing right now in what's it\u2019s called -- in CRB in North America in particular?", "John Haley", "Yes. I think that -- I do think that we've sort of passed an inflection point. I think 2016 was a tough year, overall, particularly for North America, but I think it's trending up this year. And again, remember, we did, overall CRB, we did grow by 2% for the first half of the year.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Great. And then you made a comment about the settlements, you had a loss in the team in South Florida. Was that a higher wave, a whole team? Where was it exactly? I don't usually hear about this coming out of your company.", "John Haley", "Yes, it was a whole team in South Florida here, and that was in -- gosh, I want to say the fall, maybe October of last year or something like that.", "Roger Millay", "And we had talked about that, I think, when people have asked us questions about some of the turnover and things like that. So it's nothing new from what we've talked about.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "But it's healthcare brokerage, it's not insurance brokerage?", "Roger Millay", "Well, it's a mix, but it was more.", "John Haley", "I mean, just, Shlomo, just to be clear about that, I think we did talk about that in some of the earnings call because we talked about the fact that we lost the people in that revenue.", "Roger Millay", "We have talked about that, a lot. Because it's the one area -- it's really the one specific thing that we've identified consistently that was a departure kind of out of the norm.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Hi. Good morning. My first question is on the margin side. So based on my math to hit the whirlwind or the 22% of your margin target for this year, you probably need to see about 130 basis points of margin improvement in the second half, I calculate around 90 ex-JLT in the first half of these year. So I guess what I'm trying to tie together is what's driving the margin improvement in the second half of the year? And also, what drove the unallocated net, that $9 million benefit that hit margins this quarter?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, so let me deal with the second one first. So when you look at the unallocated net, we typically will expect that to run at an expense level that's probably more in the range of what you see for the six month period. When you look at those numbers, it is more consistent six month over six month. The reason for the volatility between the first quarter and the second quarter is that we did have some movement between expenses booked at the corporate level in the first quarter that were then pushed out to the business, so released or created income in that non-operating line, and pushed out to the businesses, the segments in the second quarter.", "So that\u2019s not a net impact to margins of the company, and something that you generally wouldn\u2019t expect to happen. We just had that movement this period between the first quarter and the second quarters. In terms of overall margins, and maybe just to go back to what we talked about with Greg\u2019s question. So I think the clearest way to look at the margin management success of the company is to look at operating margins. And if you step back from first half operating margins, our operating margin was up some 50 basis points, 60 basis points by itself. But then, if you adjust for the fine arts and jewelry settlement, that will give you another 100 basis points or so, or actually, I think it was up 70 basis points without that. So you have about 170 basis points of operating margin improvement without fine arts and jewelry, which was not operating last year, so you do have to back that out.", "So, I think that\u2019s the best indicator of our margin momentum. I think when you look at EBITDA margin, it is complicated this quarter because of this FX related hit that we took for intercompany and balance sheet items which does bounce around, but it\u2019s non-operating in nature. So, I think you have to back that out, and that's why I think operating margin is a clear indicator. So, we think we\u2019re on track. As you've said, we've maintained the guidance. In our plans, we think the second half is achievable, the organization is very focused on it, I think, John talked about some of the segment progress, you can see everybody's focused, I think.", "Elyse Greenspan", "So just a follow-up to that. So as you think about the second half margin improvement, it seems like depending upon what level of OIP savings do essentially fall to the bottom line, that\u2019s more of a 2018 margin benefit based off of your comments during previously in the call. So I guess, there could be some benefit from merger savings, but you see yourself hitting your full year margin goal just by greater margins throughout all of your segments, is that how you think about it?", "Roger Millay", "Yeah. I mean, I think it\u2019s the whole company, is in the game. So it\u2019s not just the segments, but it\u2019s also all the functional areas, which you might recall, that\u2019s where a lot of the integration activities are happening. So, it is by creating plans and managing the plans throughout the company to enhance margins. I mean, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to steadily get there over the next 18 months.", "Elyse Greenspan", "And then my second question, I just want to follow up on one of the questions earlier on the call. I mean, you guys are leaving the organic growth outlook unchanged, but the half year itself probably seems to be, is at the high end. So, as you look to the pipeline and you get a feel for the business that should be coming over the next quarter, next couple of quarters, I\u2019m just finding, why not just raise the target today to enforce the momentum that you\u2019re seeing, or do you -- is there some timing or shifts that might cause you to come in below that 3% in the second half of the year?", "John Haley", "No, I mean, look, I think we had a very strong first half. We still feel pretty confident about what we're going to achieve. But I think -- we don't want to keep on, when we do well, raise the target until we make sure at some point, we don't hit it. So I mean, that's just not the game we're interested in playing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from R. W. Baird.", "Q - Mark Marcon", "Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Roger, it's been a pleasure working with you, congratulations and best wishes. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about the Exchange Solutions business? It sounds like it's evolving. How should we think about the margin profile, longer term, within that business as we end up having a bigger merger between what we used to think of as exchange -- pure exchange versus the benefits administration?", "Roger Millay", "John, you probably have some thoughts on this, maybe I'll start. I mean I don't think there's been any change in how we view where Exchange Solutions should be. They should be at least at the overall average margin targets of the company, if not with growth, leveraging -- it is more of an operating type business than the administration and related exchanges areas, so as scale is built, with the opportunity, at some point, to have above average company margins.", "John Haley", "Yes. I think that's right, Roger. And look, this is a business that is really in its infancy. And so there's a lot of cross currents that are occurring right now. We feel pretty good about being able to operate in what's a very high-growth business. We feel very good about being -- operate at a reasonable margin now. But we do think that when this builds scale and the market comes down, we are going to have an opportunity to achieve even higher margins.", "Mark Marcon", "Great. And then with IRR, you took up the guidance for the growth for the year. Can you comment on specific -- the specific areas that you're seeing the improved trends in? And then, separate from that, can you just discuss any sort of very specific timing issues that somebody should consider as it relates to just a very near-term Q3 outlook relative to Q4, if there's any particular items that we should be adjusting or incorporating into our estimates? Thank you.", "Roger Millay", "Yes, sure, maybe just a comment from me first, and that maybe John will have something to add on. I think when you look across IRR, broadly, as John went through in his script remarks, you're seeing just better performance year-over-year in most of that segment. And reinsurance is performing well, the risk consulting business is performing well, and the investment business is performing well. So taking up the guidance just as a reflection both of first half performance as well as the expectation that trends will be better through the year than they were last year. John?", "John Haley", "Yes, I think, to your second question, Mark, there's really nothing we see that are big flows between quarter three and quarter four at this time, so nothing to report there.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, please note that this call will be ending at 10:00 o\u2019clock a.m. It\u2019s a hard stop. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Cash flow, up nicely for six months was down in the second quarter, 41% versus 76% I calculate. I assume the legal settlement a year ago drove that. This is a relatively thin quarter typically for cash flow. Anything big pushes and shoves in the numbers? And where are you on sort of pension cash expenses for the year in your expectations versus last year?", "Roger Millay", "Yes, so for pension specifically, I think there was roughly $250 million of outflow last year and we think it's going to be a bit below $200 million this year. Overall kind of puts and takes in the first half cash flows, we do have some absorption from working capital in the first half. You see that in the cash flow statement. We have a bid in CapEx, so I think we've talked about this in the past, but you would expect during integration to have a bit of a bump up in capital expenditures as a result of the big IT consolidation projects we have, as well as the big real estate projects, and you're starting to see that more in the first half of this year.", "And then, as I mentioned in my remarks, you also have an impact from the bonus payments year-over-year. so a bit more cash going out this year because of the half year only payment to the Legacy Towers Watson folks last year.", "Bob Glasspiegel", "How much above normal would you say your IT CapEx for restructuring is running?", "Roger Millay", "So CapEx was $20 million over last year. I mean, I don't know if I should call last year a fairly normal year, but we didn't have a lot because the CapEx projects themselves take a while to -- they tend to be more complex type areas. So that's probably the best benchmark that we have about how much in the first half was above normal.", "John Haley", "Okay, thanks very much, everyone, for joining us this morning. And I look forward to talking to you at our third quarter earnings call in November.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call.

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Willis Towers Watson Earnings Call. On the call today, with me on the call today are John Haley, Willis Towers Watson\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Burwell, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please refer to our website for the press release issued earlier today.

After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the conference call for your questions.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Aida, and good morning, everyone. Today, we\u2019ll review our results for the third quarter of 2017 and discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2017. However, before I get to the results this morning, I\u2019d like to acknowledge those who\u2019ve been impacted by any of the recent tragedies that have been experienced around the world. On behalf of all the Willis Towers Watson colleagues, I extend our heartfelt condolences to those who lost loved ones in the hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, fires, landslides and the horrific events in Las Vegas and New York. Our thoughts are also with those who lost their homes and businesses and continue to deal with these life-changing events. A number of our own colleagues were also impacted by these events. Our thoughts are with them during this time of recovery.", "I also want to thank all of our colleagues for their swift action to help our clients before, during and in the aftermath of all of these events, with a special acknowledgment to our brokerage colleagues. Before the storms hit, our brokers were able to run proprietary models, which provided a cone of uncertainty to our clients, so they could focus resources on the locations which were most at risk. We were providing these updates five to six times a day. We contacted our clients with claim and contact data ahead of the storms and for those who were in the vicinity of the wildfires in California. Our forensic teams were out in full force within hours, and many more of our colleagues were called into the field to support them. Not only are our teams working with the carriers to try to expedite claim assessment and payment, but they\u2019re also trying to minimize losses after the fact and get our clients back on their feet as quickly as possible.", "One example of this commitment came in the aftermath of Irma. A Willis Towers Watson broker worked with the carrier to track down a generator, so additional damage to a client\u2019s facility could be prevented. Even as many of our own colleagues were impacted by these events and were out of pocket, our commitment to our clients was and remains steadfast. Contingency plans were implemented to ensure our clients in the impacted areas had a point of contact. The collaboration and support among all of our colleagues exemplified Willis Towers Watson values. It\u2019s especially clear that in times like this, the commitment to our clients goes well beyond just securing an insurance policy.", "Now I\u2019d like to move on to our third quarter results. Reported revenues for the quarter were $1.9 billion, up 4% as compared to the prior year third quarter and up 4% on both the constant-currency and organic basis. Reported revenues included $12 million of positive currency movement. We observed growth in all of our segments and regions for the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $54 million, as compared to the prior year third quarter net loss of $31 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 17% and was $322 million, or 17.4% of total revenues, as compared to the prior year third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $275 million, or 15.5% of total revenues. For the quarter, diluted loss per share was $0.40 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.12. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had no impact on the adjusted diluted EPS.", "Now let\u2019s look at each of the segments in more detail. As a reminder, beginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affected our segment results. These changes were detailed in the Form 8-K, we filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees constant currency, unless specifically stated otherwise.", "Our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues and are before consideration of unallocated corporate cost, such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring cost and certain transaction and integration expenses, resulting from mergers and acquisition. The segment results include discretionary compensation.", "Total segment commissions and fees grew 3% on a constant-currency basis and 4% on an organic basis. Human Capital & Benefits, or HCB, commissions and fees growth was 2% and organic growth was 3%, as compared to the prior year third quarter. Our Technology and Administration Solutions, or TAS, revenues increased by almost 30%. All regions had strong growth, as we continued to implement new clients and provided additional support to existing clients in Great Britain with respect to the legislative changes.", "Health and Benefits commissions and fees growth was 2%, contributing to the year-to-date growth of 8%. This quarter\u2019s results were driven by the major increase in new global benefit appointments. North America\u2019s large market also continued to see strong growth in both project work and product sales, and middle market revenues grew modestly. Notably, these results were partially offset, as international revenues decreased due to the sale of our Global Wealth Solutions business.", "On an organic basis, international grew by 16%. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees grew 1%, primarily due to strong software sales, increased project work related to corporate transactions and growth in compensation surveys. This growth was somewhat offset by lower demand in the rewards advisory business.", "As expected, retirement commissions and fees were down by 2%. The lower demand for Bulk Lump Sum work in North America and a decline in special projects in Western Europe were partially offset by very strong growth in Great Britain. The growth in Great Britain was related to pension legislation and continued demand for derisking services.", "International also had strong growth, in large part due to our acquisition of Russell\u2019s actuarial business, earlier this year. The operating margin for the HCB segment was 19%, an increase of 1% from the prior year third quarter. Revenue growth in disciplined expense management contributed to the margin growth. Overall, we continued to have a very positive outlook for the HCB business in 2017.", "Now turning to Corporate Risk and Broking, or CRB. Constant currency and organic commissions and fees were up 4% as compared to the prior year third quarter. North America CRB had solid growth of 4%, driven by increased new business and strong retention in all regions. International had 15% growth as a result of increased new recurring business as well as excellent retention driven by Russia, South Africa and Asia, offset by softness in Latin America. Western Europe had solid growth led by Sweden and Benelux. Great Britain commissions and fees declined by about 1%, as a result of declines in transport and a strong comparable from the prior year. Client retention was approximately 92% this quarter.", "On a side note, I\u2019d like to say how pleased I am with the progress the management team and all of our colleagues have made over the last few quarters. To see the growth in North America is a very positive sign. Not only do we have the management and regional market structure finalized, but I believe this is a turning point for the segment as exhibited by our results this quarter. The job of our leadership certainly doesn\u2019t end with the restructuring. Moving forward, the business will be managed in a continuous improving environment or what we call business as usual.", "The CRB segment had an 8% operating margin, flat to the prior year third quarter. The third quarter margin remained flat despite the revenue shortfall in Great Britain. We\u2019re very pleased with the momentum in our CRB business globally.", "Now to Investment, Risk and Reinsurance, or IRR. Constant currency and organic commissions and fees increased 2% as compared to the prior year third quarter. As a reminder, the Reinsurance line of business represents Treaty-based Reinsurance only. The Facultative Reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment. Insurance, Consulting and Technology, or ICT, formally called Risk, Consulting and Software, lead the growth for the segment as a result of strong software sales, Reinsurance commissions and fees growth was flat as a result of positive timing in previous quarters and continued pricing pressure on renewals. However, overall renewals increased as a result of higher returns on U.S. investment income. Investment commission and fees were flat but revenues increased as a result of increased performance fees.", "Wholesale, Securities and Max Matthiessen grew slightly due to an increase in performance fees and new business as well as positive timing on some contracting. Commissions and fees were offset by a decline in the portfolio in underwriting business, driven by a loss of profit commissions following the Atlantic hurricanes, the cancellation of a contract and the divestiture of a number of our small programs in the portfolio.", "For the quarter, the Investment, Risk & Reinsurance segment had a 12% operating margin, flat to the prior year third quarter. We continue to feel very positive about the momentum of the IRR business for 2017. Not only is the core business doing well, but we\u2019re excited about some of the innovation taking place. For example -- well, I guess, one prominent example is the development of the Asset Management Exchange, or AMX. This exchange is a more efficient way for institutional investors and investment managers to transact with one another. It offers investors a smarter, easier and less expensive way to access their preferred investment managers by cutting the time needed and the expense occurred in operational tasks, like negotiating contracts, while at the same time, introducing an extra layer of risk monitoring. It also provides many of the same efficiencies for investment managers and it reduces their compliance burden while opening up a marketplace for a potentially new business. AMX is currently available in the UK, in Ireland and Australia and has only been operational for eight months. We already have more than $2 billion of assets on the exchange and are getting great traction in adding both investors and investment managers.", "So last, we\u2019ve changed the name of Exchange Solutions to Benefit, Delivery and Administration, or BDA. Commissions and fees for BDA increased by 11% from the prior year third quarter. Driven by increased enrollment at our Individual Marketplace, which was formerly known as the Retiree and Access Exchanges. The Individual Marketplace commissions and fees increased by 9%. The rest of the segment increased by 15%. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increase in our Group Marketplace, and that was what was formerly known as the active employee exchange. The Health and Welfare in North America, pension outsourcing business continued to grow, primarily due to new clients and customized Active Exchange projects.", "So let me turn to the 2018 enrollments. As we mentioned in our previous earnings calls, we have six large clients with about 150,000 total lives that have committed for the 2018 enrollment period in our Group Marketplace. The mid-market sales season is winding down, and it won\u2019t be finalized really until later this month, but we expect to have enrolled approximately 35,000 lives by the end of December 2017. As we mentioned in our previous call, the Individual Marketplace exchange enrollment process is changing as the business matures. Enrollments will be spread more evenly throughout the year, so that while we may have 70,000 to 80,000 retirees enrolled during 2018, only about 30,000 are scheduled to enroll for January 1, 2018. The BDA segment had a 20% operating margin, as compared to 14% in the prior year third quarter. The Individual Marketplace business was primarily responsible for the increase in margin, as our seasonal staffing models were aligned with the expected pacing of enrollments during the year. While there are elements of this business, which continue to evolve, we like the direction the business is taking and continued to be optimistic about the long-term growth of the BDA business.", "So moving on to our merger synergy objectives in the Operational Improvement Program, or OIP. As we\u2019ve discussed in past calls, we surpassed our tax rate objective of obtaining a 25% tax rate by the end of calendar 2017, and we\u2019re on track to achieve the net $125 million in cost synergies when we exit 2018. All savings initiatives will be completed and project management resources and costs will be eliminated as of this December 31, 2017. We expect to meet our savings goals of $95 million, and this is an important driver in achieving our 25% adjusted EBITDA margin.", "Our merger objectives also identified three specific areas of revenue synergies: Global Health solutions: the U.S. mid-market exchange; and large market P&C. We\u2019ve already achieved nearly 60% of our three year Global Health solutions synergy sales goals. The average sale size has increased over 2016, and the sales pipeline continues to be quite strong. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in this service offering. The mid-market sales exchange process for the January 2018, enrollment implementations is winding down, and unlike the large market sales, we expect to see a decrease in our year-over-year sales. The sales pipeline, that remain strong, but we\u2019ve seen clients delaying decisions, and we think this may be related to the long-running ACA debate. Now the ACA [technical difficulty] impact our clients, but we seem to experience a pause whenever there\u2019s debate around healthcare legislation. We continue to believe their significant potential for the mid-market exchange business and that we continue to be focused on its growth.", "Finally turning to the P&C synergies. We\u2019ve won almost 40 assignments in the large market. As discussed in the last earnings call, most of the wins are generating modest revenue, but we have a strong pipeline, are adding key resources and continue to enhance our marketing strategies. Overall, we like the momentum in the large market space.", "So I\u2019d like to thank all of our clients for placing their trust in our company to assist them with important risk and human capital issues. I also want to thank our colleagues for their continued client focus, collaboration engagement and to congratulate everyone on a very good quarter.", "I\u2019m also pleased to introduce Mike Burwell, our new CFO. For those of you who\u2019ve not seen the press release announcing Mike\u2019s appointment, he has extensive experience in accounting, finance, M&A and organizational transformation. We couldn\u2019t possibly have asked for a better fit for Willis Towers Watson, and I couldn\u2019t be happier to have Mike as part of the team. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.", "Mike Burwell", "Thanks, John. Thanks very much for those kind words, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019m very excited to be here as well. I\u2019m looking forward to executing the role of CFO, working with our board, John and the entire leadership team as well as our 41,000 colleagues around the world here at Willis Towers Watson, as we look to deliver 2018 merger objectives and share our long-term vision well beyond next year.", "So now for some additional insight into our financial results. Income from operations for the quarter was 41 million, or 2.2% of revenues. The prior year third quarter operating income was 1 million, or 0.1% of total revenues. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was 287 million or 15.5% of total revenues, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter, adjusted operating income of 243 million or 13.7% of total revenues. The key drivers were strong revenue growth and prudent expense management.", "I\u2019ll also like to touch base on taxes. I\u2019ll like to provide you with some additional insight, as it relates to our U.S. GAAP and adjusted tax rates. U.S. GAAP tax rate for the quarter was negative 53%, and the adjusted tax rate was 32.1%. The negative 53% U.S. GAAP tax rate is primarily a result of tax expense associated with the discrete tax item recorded in the third quarter regarding an internal tax restructuring. The adjusted tax rate of 32.1% is a result of our seasonality in our earnings. We continue to reiterate our 2017 adjusted tax rate guidance of 23% to 24% for the entire year. Included in other expense, income line -- on our income statement is $10 million loss on the sale of our Global Wealth Solutions business. This line item also includes the impact of our currency hedging program.", "Moving on to our balance sheet. We continue to have a very strong financial position. This quarter, we repurchased approximately $166 million of Willis Towers Watson stock, bringing the total for the year to $462 million. As it was discussed in our Form 10-Q, we also settled the shareholder appraisal lawsuit related to the Willis-Towers merger, this past quarter. As part of the settlement, we paid approximately $211 million to settle the shareholder lawsuit, which resulted in the cancellation of more than 1.4 million shares. This cancellation had the same impact as a buyback and then -- that reduced the number of outstanding shares. As of September 30, 2017, the remaining stock repurchase authority was $671 million. The canceled shares related to litigation are also excluded from the share buyback authority. As you may recall, our expectation was to buy back about $0.5 billion of shares for 2017. Through September 30, we\u2019ve spent $669 million in stock buybacks, which includes the cancellation of shares relating to the settlement on the shareholder litigation.", "Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2017 was $317 million, a decrease from $470 million for the same period in the prior year. The year-over-year variance was related to an increase in days sales outstanding, specifically in the southern part of United States; our capital spending cost in the prior year for our increase in integration efforts; the interest charges and cost related to the shareholder appraisal settlement; and the 2017 bonus payments. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, on a year-to-date basis, we paid out full year of bonuses in March 2017, as compared to a partial bonus payments related to the timing of the merger in 2016.", "One additional note regarding the shareholder appraisal settlement. If we consider the total settlement of $211 million, which included the $33 million consisting of statutory interest and other charges, we were able to cancel the shares at approximately $150 per share, a discount from the current market pricing. The fourth quarter is generally a seasonally strong free cash generator for us, and we will continue to focus on enhancing free cash flow as we wind down fiscal of 2017.", "Now let\u2019s review our guidance for 2017 for Willis Towers Watson. We now expect constant currency revenue growth for 2017 to be around 3%. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the 23% to 24% range for the entire year. For segment revenues, we continue to expect low single-digit constant currency commissions and fees growth for HCB and CRB. IRR commissions and fees are expected to be in the range of low to mid-single-digit growth. Benefits, Delivery and Administration expects to have commissions and fee growth of approximately 10%.", "Before moving on to the rest of the guidance, I\u2019d like to address the potential of pricing increases in the market. We\u2019ll be issuing our Marketplace Realities annual report for North American insurance buyers shortly. This report, which is based on carrier discussions and update loss -- updated loss projections, states that we expect to see rate increases in the property CAT and property CAT with loss products. I\u2019d highlight that the rate increases in a couple of products in an otherwise expansive market is not an indicator of an overall hardening market or that Willis Towers Watson will benefit from these increases in any meaningful way. There are many variables to assess, such as client reactions and carrier competition, to fully understand the impact to our future results.", "Now moving on to transaction integration expenses. We had projected integration expenses of approximately $200 million earlier this year. We\u2019re now expecting this to approach $240 million for 2017 due to the $33 million transaction expense incurred related to the shareholder appraisal settlement. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be 23% to 24% for the full year, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $8.36 to $8.51. Again, annual guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.28 to the pound and $1.13 to the euro. We expect approximately $10 million of expense associated with our currency hedging programs in the fourth quarter. This expense flows through other expense income below the income from operations line. The hedging program excludes the potential impact for balance sheet movements.", "Before I turn the call back to John, I\u2019d like to address plans to communicate how the forthcoming revenue recognition standards will impact our results. We anticipate filing an 8-K and hosting a call to review the changes later this year. Consistent with transition requirements, we plan to report our results in parallel with our current methodology and under that the new guidelines, for all 4 quarters of 2018. This will allow the investment community to track changes in the quarter. There\u2019ll be no need to recalibrate our 2018 merger objectives.", "Additionally, we\u2019ll be hosting Analyst Day on March 16, 2018. I also look forward to meeting our analysts and investors in the following months.", "I\u2019ll turn it back to John.", "John Haley", "Okay, thanks very much, Mike. And now we\u2019ll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James.", "Greg Peters", "I wanted to follow up on your comments around the margin improvement -- the operating margin, or lack thereof, of improvement in CRB. As we look forward to future quarters, is there any seasonality around the expected rate of improvement in adjusted EBITDA or operating margins?", "John Haley", "I don\u2019t know, Greg. We have -- We certainly have seasonality in the revenues overall through the quarters. Seasonality in the margin improvement, I think, is probably a little less pronounced than that. So we\u2019ll be looking to -- in some ways, some of those -- the margin improvements are a lot like the tax rate, where we focus on the annual result as opposed to its distribution among the quarters too much.", "Greg Peters", "Right. Well, and I -- and I\u2019ve observed, if I just look at the adjusted EBITDA on a year-to-date basis, there\u2019s only a 60 basis point improvement. And I would\u2019ve expected to track a little bit higher than that, but it\u2019s in line with your guidance.", "John Haley", "Yes.", "Greg Peters", "Maybe you can came at it from a different way. I know you\u2019ve established 25% adjusted EBITDA margin as, sort of, your longer-term target. And I think some of the integration savings are expected to be fully realized when you exit 2018. So, can you provide us some perspective on that longer-term target? And where you are in that process?", "John Haley", "Yes. So I think I\u2019ll make a couple comments and Mike may want to weigh in on this too. But -- look, a lot of the -- as you know, we\u2019re winding down OIP now. And we\u2019ve had some of our -- I referenced the $95 million in savings, we expected from OIP -- or the $95 million we spent for some of the savings to come in, and I think we\u2019ll probably get a little less than half of that flowing through to margins. But we see some of that has come in already, but actually a big chunk of that will be coming in, in 2018. So we\u2019ll see some of the savings that\u2019ll continue to come in there. I think overall though, as we look at the -- we\u2019ll come out with our guidance for 2018 on the next call, but there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve seen that makes us back off our 25% EBITDA for the next year. Mike, do you want to...", "Mike Burwell", "Yes, I would just add, John. I mean, if you look at through quarter, you see the reduction in salaries and benefits overall. You see it in terms of other cost reductions, that are happening. Uniquely, it\u2019s offset, obviously, by inflation that\u2019s come into place, but you\u2019re seeing that overall improvement happening. So I think that glide path, there\u2019s nothing there right now that tells us -- that suggests to us that we shouldn\u2019t meet that EBITDA margin of 25% by the end of 2018.", "Greg Peters", "So that, John, just to clarify, the 25% target was by the end of 2018. It wasn\u2019t for the full year, I believe?", "John Haley", "That\u2019s correct. Yes.", "Mike Burwell", "That\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dave Styblo from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Dave Styblo", "Just come back on organic growth, you guys had a strong quarter, 4%. I think, it was better than the 3%, what the industry were looking for. And to come back on the margin, I guess, I would\u2019ve expected margins to be a little bit better and outperform on that side. A couple of the areas I know, Greg was just asking about CRB seemed not to have the uplift that we would\u2019ve thought and the same thing in IRR, where margins were up nicely year-over-year in the first and -- first quarter and second quarter, if you adjust for JLT, but the third quarter margins in IRR were actually down if you back out the $7 million of higher interest and other income. So, just curious to understand again, why we didn\u2019t see more leverage in the business, was there a timing aspect and then as you go forward and realize more of these synergies, should we expect more of that future flow of -- through in the fourth quarter, as you exit the year? Or when you talk about exiting this year, is the impact more as you get into 2018?", "Mike Burwell", "Yes, I mean, I -- we\u2019re continuing to see the directional improvement happening overall. We definitely see IRR having higher revenues in the first half of the year and in terms of what those numbers actually drive to. And I\u2019ve -- you see pretty good EBITDA growth overall in terms of the numbers themselves. So look, we\u2019d always love more, but we feel pretty good about with the numbers are.", "Dave Styblo", "Mike, maybe, as you are stepping into the seat, I just -- I\u2019m curious to hear what your mandate is? What are the top three or four priorities that you\u2019re working through? And maybe some early takes of what you\u2019ve observed so far being in the CFO seat.", "Mike Burwell", "Well, I mean, the mandates aren\u2019t different than the objectives that John has laid out in -- from previously, in terms of execution on that and executing in the CFO role. I\u2019ve been really frankly pleased with the depth and breadth of the people that exist at Willis Towers Watson. The individual leaders of individual business segments are very strong individuals, and my impressions of them and their ability to be able to drive and lead us to the objectives that we\u2019ve put forth, I\u2019ve felt a lot of confidence in them, and I really look forward to working with them. So I\u2019ve been even more pleased then I went through the interview process in terms of interacting with people and what that means. And I think, I\u2019ll go back to what John said at the outset of this call, when he talked about colleagues and what they do for our clients, and how they help and work with each other. I mean, the culture at Willis Towers Watson is one about serving clients, and ultimately, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about and I\u2019ve been truly impressed with how people have serviced and worked with their clients and the various stakeholders that we have overall. So I guess, my initial views, like I am continuing to formulate in terms of what those specifically mean, but I\u2019ve been very impressed that -- I was just starting week four here in terms of being here at Willis Towers Watson.", "Dave Styblo", "Okay. And then lastly, just on the portfolio itself, it sounds like you guys made a little bit of pruning a couple of divestitures at least. If you go forward, how much more trimming or reshaping of the portfolio do you think you have to go? And as you look forward to M&A opportunities, are there things in the pipeline that look very attractive to you guys? Or do you have more of a bias towards buyback, as you just want to continue to work on integrating the two businesses and not get distracted by another other deal, potentially?", "Mike Burwell", "Yes, I mean, I think, as we said in the press release, overall, I mean, we\u2019ll continue to look at the portfolio where things -- whether they make the right strategic alignment for us or not. But we don\u2019t see anything big or imminent that\u2019s there in terms of our overall thinking. But we will continue to refine and align our strategies and look at assets that make sense. We\u2019ll equally look at as you\u2019ve seen throughout the year, look at acquisitions where they make sense to be niche businesses and tie back into it. Really, our focus is continue to deliver, what we\u2019ve put forth in our integration efforts and synergies, going forward. So that\u2019s my thoughts, John, anything you\u2019d add to that?", "John Haley", "No. I think that\u2019s right. I think, look, this has been a relatively complex merger, and this is required all of our time and attention during this first couple of years. We always said that in the longer run, we thought M&A would be a part of it and I think we\u2019re at the point now where we could potentially contemplate some things, but we are still mostly focused on just making this merger as successful as we can. Let me just make a one quick point too, about -- I think, as we talk about the margins, I mean, I think, one of the things we looked at is the 17% increase in EBITDA. So we\u2019re pretty excited about the margins we had overall. There are some things that happened underneath this thing as to how things get allocated. So for example, I think with the aggressive line integration last year, we didn\u2019t allocate a lot of corporate expenses to them, and we had them in other places. This year, we\u2019re allocating corporate expenses to them. So it\u2019s makes the margins is CRB look a little bit worse, but we are really focused on the overall 17% increase in EBITDA. We have a next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Kai Pan", "And first, congrats to Mike for the new role. My first question is, sort of, if you\u2019re looking back a year ago where you have your Analyst Day, you layout like three like drivers for your 10-10 target in 2018. How do you feel like a year later, your confidence level in each of those?", "John Haley", "Yes. So I think, if you look at our EBITDA, the 25%, getting to that by the end of 2018. That\u2019s still something that we are -- that\u2019s just something that we\u2019re continuing to drive towards. And as I said it, that\u2019s not anything that we\u2019ve been backing off there. We talked about share repurchase also, and I think we talked about share repurchase between -- somewhere between 2 million and 8 million, or something like that. So far, we\u2019ve repurchased I think through September 30, 4.8 million -- 4.7 million, 4.8 million, somewhere around there. So we\u2019re well into where we\u2019d intended to be there. We look at the revenue growth, and we were looking at revenue growth figures between -- somewhere between 2.5% and 4.5% or so, or something like that. And we\u2019re now delivering solid margin growth in the 3% to 4% for each quarter. ", "So I think, as we look at all of those, we still have work -- we have not yet put together our 2018 guidance on the specific things, but when we look at the different targets we\u2019ve been setting ourselves -- oh, and finally, the other one, of course, was the tax rate, but as we talked about, you\u2019ve already gotten to where we wanted to there. We look at all these things, and we say, we feel some confidence that we can attack these and get to where we want to be.", "Kai Pan", "Okay, that\u2019s great. My follow-up question is on your free cash flow. I think you\u2019re talking about in the past of getting to that $1.3 billion run rate by the end of 2018. I just wonder, as your free cash will grow, how do you allocate then in term of the buybacks and maybe on the deleverage side or acquisitions and also on the buybacks, as your stock has appreciated quite a bit so far this year? And do you think it\u2019s still attractive return for you guys to continue to the buybacks?", "John Haley", "Yes, so I think, look we had talked about wanting to maintain a low investor grade rating -- investment grade rating. And so I think, we\u2019ll continue to do that. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see -- we\u2019re not anticipating to do significant deleveraging or anything there. But to keep that -- but to be solidly in that low investment grade rating, that\u2019ll free up a lot of our free cash flow for other purposes. We -- as we said earlier, well, we\u2019ve been looking at potential acquisitions and we\u2019ll continue to do that. When we model it there, we still find our stock to be an attractive use of our cash and buying that back. And so we have to balance all of those. But I wouldn\u2019t -- I think, unless something unusual were to come along, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any significant decline in our buying back shares, and I think, we\u2019d continue to use most of our free cash flow for that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "John, is there anything that was pulled forward into the third quarter or anything that was unusual in terms of the 4% organic growth? And what I\u2019m driving at over here is the organic -- the growth guidance was nudged up from like 2% to 3% to 3%, but you\u2019ve grown 3% plus, I think, a little bit in the first half of the year, now 4%, and is there any reason, why you shouldn\u2019t be above 3% for the whole year?", "John Haley", "No, I think, look, we -- Shlomo, we had 3%, I guess, for the whole fourth quarter here, and we did 4% -- we had 2% to 3%, I guess, for the fourth quarter, and we did 4% and we nudged it up to 3%. We\u2019re not trying to fine tune this all that much beyond that, but somewhere around 3%, we think sounds reasonable.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then can you just give us a little bit of a free cash flow walk just talking about some of the, maybe, onetime items in the year to date. I think you talked about the $211 million on the settlement, but are there other thing we should talk about in terms of getting a good baseline in 2018, as we think about the exit 2019 -- excuse me, 2017 as we talk about the exit 2019 target of somewhere around $1.3 billion?", "John Haley", "Sure, I\u2019ll get a -- I think I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike, Shlomo, to take you through that but actually [best] before I move on to that, I might mention something from your previous question, which triggered a thought that the third quarter of 2017 is an unusual quarter for Willis Towers Watson, in that there\u2019s nothing unusual about it. This is the first time that we don\u2019t have some really big distorting event in either our current quarter or the quarter a year ago or something like that. And so when you asked about things being pulled forward or something, I mean there\u2019s always the little things around the margin. But by and large, it\u2019s a relatively clean quarter, and we couldn\u2019t be happier about that.", "Mike Burwell", "Yes, and coming back on your free cash flow question, Shlomo, I mean, we still believe there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s changing our mind in terms of looking at the \u201818 target we\u2019re had out there at $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, free cash looking out through the end of \u201818. If you look specifically at \u201817 or this quarter, what the difference is -- as referenced in my comments, one is, really looking at bonus payments. So this year we had a full year of bonus payments where in the prior year, we only had a partial year of those bonus payments. We did see a DSO rise in the current quarter, and I referenced the southern part of the United States, but as you relate to certain parts of the hurricane and some of those disasters impacted the processing and payment abilities of certain of our clients and customers and stakeholders to get that money in, and we believe that we\u2019ll see that return here in the fourth quarter, and equally we had integration spending happening as a key driver as you see in the numbers for the fourth quarter. So those are their principal things or the primary things that were really driving that change in free cash flow.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Naklicki from Citi.", "James Naklicki", "Just a follow-up on the last question there. So on the free cash flow, the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, just to clarify that, is that a 2018 number or is that an exit 2018 number? And then, my second question -- well, I guess, you can answer that one and then we\u2019ll go in the that -- so then I have a follow-up.", "Mike Burwell", "That there is a 2018 number.", "James Naklicki", "And looking at the business, you just restructured it. You are our selling new business again. Then I look at the organic growth rates, it\u2019s been 3% to 4% this year. Is that, sort of, what should we -- we should expect from the company in the future, or do you think it could actually improve from there?", "Mike Burwell", "Yes, I mean I, obviously -- I\u2019m excited about the prospects of what you see happening in the marketplace and with clients or customers, but John, I\u2019ll defer to your thoughts.", "John Haley", "Yes, I mean, look, I think, if we look at our overall businesses that we\u2019re in, we think that probably about 3% is what the market is growing at. Now, as we go through the different segments and the different lines of business, you can see that they all have their own individual growth rates. But probably about 3% is right for the organization as a whole. We\u2019ve been focused on making sure we\u2019re growing at least as fast as the market, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve accomplished this year. We were slightly ahead, I think, this year with that. But in the long run, we won\u2019t be satisfied with just growing at the market, we want to be growing faster than that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Elyse Greenspan", "So my first question, I guess, just a little bit more color on the CRB segment, the 4% growth was a nice pick up in the quarter. Can that level of growth continue from here? I mean, is that what you have embedded in, kind of, your 3% overall outlook, you just mentioned? And included within that question, you alluded to maybe not potentially seeing a benefit in your growth from the improving property and property CAT pricing. And maybe this is a more broader brokerage question as opposed to just CRB, can we get a breakdown of your business mix between commissions and fees just on the brokerage side of the business?", "John Haley", "Yes. So let\u2019s see, let me deal with the second one first. It\u2019s about 65% is the roughly commissions, right, I think?", "Mike Burwell", "Yes.", "John Haley", "That\u2019s not an exact number, Elyse, but it\u2019s roughly right.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Oh, and then on the...", "John Haley", "I\u2019m sorry, the first part of the -- the first question was?", "Elyse Greenspan", "The first question was just in terms of the CRB growth, the 4%?", "John Haley", "Growth, yes. Yes. Right, I mean, look, I think, I wouldn\u2019t want to take one quarter and say that\u2019s going to be exactly what we\u2019re going to be doing. But we\u2019ve been growing at about 3% or better this whole year, and I think that\u2019s what we think -- that\u2019s what we probably be planning for, for next year. And in the prior question, I said we want to be a company that\u2019s going to be growing above the market in the long run. But I think what we\u2019re focused now is making sure that we are solidly in it, that 3% area, year-after-year, and then we\u2019ll try to move on from that. The third quarter is probably our lowest quarter anyway, so I don\u2019t want read too much into that.", "Elyse Greenspan", "And then I have a tax question. So you guys alluded to achieving the tax saves associated with the merger. There is, obviously, some upcoming potential changes to the U.S. tax structure. So as the U.S. tax rate goes to 20% and interest deductibility is limited, how do you see that potential changes to the U.S. tax structure impacting Willis Towers Watson\u2019s overall tax rates and kind of the 23% to 24% rate that you guys are running at?", "John Haley", "Yes. So this is one of these things, Elyse, where the devil really is in the details. So I think, for example, when you say limits on interest deductibility, it depends very much on what those limits are, of how they do it -- as to how it would affect us. Here\u2019s what I think we could tell you, and probably what we would look at as the worst case, if the U.S. went to a 20% rate, and there were severe limits on interest deductibility, it could actually make our tax rate go up 1% or so. That\u2019s if we did nothing and presumably, we would be able to -- our current structures isn\u2019t the best and so we would be able to get back to where we were eventually or maybe even a little better. But if you get to the 20% rate and depending on how some other things are done, some particular details there, we could actually be better off. So we don\u2019t know for right now, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a major impact to us one way or another, and certainly, whatever happens, we\u2019ll have to make sure that we have our taxes structured in the most-efficient tax planning we can.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay, great. And then 1 more modeling question if I could ask. At unallocated expense line, there seems to be a lot of volatility on a quarterly basis. I believe earlier, you mentioned bringing some expenses down to the segments this year that maybe was not the case last year. Is that part of what we\u2019re seeing? Also, there was a benefit this Q3 that was higher than last Q3. Just some, kind of, direction of how we could think about modeling that line going forward and what should we expect in the fourth quarter? Does your guidance assume corporate -- if that line would see expenses about in line with last Q4, the 36 million?", "John Haley", "Okay. I mean, Mike is the expert on the expense line, so Mike I\u2019ll pass it over to you.", "Mike Burwell", "So the number for this quarter that you\u2019re reading, the 1 million in there is actually a benefit, and the benefit is principally related to bonus payments. So the segments have been charged the bonus amounts, and we have reversed a bit at the topside and, therefore, in the fourth quarter we\u2019ll reallocate that back out to the actual segments themselves. So actually, their margins have been a bit penalized because it hasn\u2019t been allocated fully out to them at this stage but that will get cleaned up. In the fourth quarter, I would expect a fairly small or modest number there on that line item because when we close the books out, everything has been allocated back out. And it\u2019s just a timing issue in terms of how things are actually done from a bookkeeping standpoint.", "John Haley", "But just to make it 100% clear, the margins at the organization level, at the whole company level are correct. What happens is, and we have some expenses that we don\u2019t -- that are too high for the segments essentially is what happens and to the extent they\u2019re too high, we just do that, we put that in the unallocated bucket and get back to the right ones.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open.", "Mark Marcon", "Welcome, Mike. Just look forward to working with you. With regards to what is now called the DBA segment, how should we think about just the underlying savings that are being provided to the clients? Are they still seeing the same, sort of, savings on what was -- what used to be formerly called the Active Exchange? And how are you thinking about the prospects of those savings going forward? And should -- if there are in fact savings, shouldn\u2019t we continue to see growth in that area over time?", "John Haley", "Yes, I think the answer is that this is still an attractive business for the clients in that regard. We\u2019re seeing -- certainly on the active side we\u2019re seeing at least 5% I think for our clients there. Depending on what their particular configuration is and where they\u2019re coming from, the 5% to 15% is certainly in the range. But we\u2019re seeing at least 5%, so we\u2019re continuing to see larger increases for the retirees. That\u2019s still a very attractive proposition. So all of the financial advantages to -- and there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s happened that\u2019s changed the financial advantages to going to exchanges. And so it\u2019s one of the reasons why we said, despite the natural reticence of people to maybe make moves in the middle of a big debate about ACA or other potential healthcare legislation, we\u2019re pretty excited about the longer-run future of exchanges.", "Mark Marcon", "Great. And then if I could just get a little bit of clarification in terms of the intent with regards to the -- your question three within the press release, specifically about rate increases within Property & Casualty. Generally speaking, all other things being equal. If we get rate increases, that would typically be better for business, no?", "John Haley", "Oh, yes. If we get rate increases it would be better for business. I think the caution there is -- let me say this, rate increases will -- are like -- rate increases are in the first blush are likely to increase our commissions and fees. Now one thing that could happen is, of course, sometimes people might buy less insurance or buy less reinsurance if rates are higher, so you have to factor that potential behavior in there. The other thing we were saying is, you have to know which lines of business the rates increases are coming through to understand what the impact is on the company, and we just don\u2019t want to rush to any conclusions about that.", "Mark Marcon", "Sure. And so you, just to clarify the intent of the comment. It\u2019s basically in order to make sure that people don\u2019t get ahead of themselves but at the end of the day, it\u2019s hard to imagine how this wouldn\u2019t be positive.", "John Haley", "Well, yes. I mean, yes, yes, Mark, although there\u2019s a -- potentially a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines that -- alternative capital that could flow into the market. And certainly, in 2006, after the big events in 2005, we saw an enormous influx of alternative capital. So I just -- I think anybody can who tells you they know what\u2019s going to happen for sure is that -- the one thing you can be sure is they probably don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America.", "Jay Cohen", "Yes. Most of my questions were answered. Just one follow-up from the Elyse\u2019s question on the unallocated. You kind of explained what happened this quarter, but looking forward, can you give us any guidance, should it be a positive number, a negative number, or should we just assume zero for that line?", "John Haley", "Yes. I would say that assuming zero, I think the most important thing for this though to recognize is that, if for 1 reason or another, we\u2019ve been accruing expenses inside a segment that is too large or too small, then we\u2019re trying it up, so that we get to the right thing for the organization. And so at the organizational level, it\u2019s -- it doesn\u2019t matter whether we put it in the segments and we have unallocated at 0 or whether we charge it in the segments and then reverse it in unallocated, it -- you\u2019re getting to the right number.", "Jay Cohen", "That makes sense. Really from a modeling standpoint, it makes sense to put the 0, and if it is different than 0, there\u2019s an offset somewhere else, probably.", "John Haley", "Exactly.", "Mike Burwell", "Exactly.", "Jay Cohen", "That\u2019s great. And then the other question, benefits delivery. The margin there increased pretty significantly, year-over-year. Anything unusual happening in that number or hurting the year-ago quarter?", "John Haley", "No. I think there\u2019s two aspects to that. And we have always said that when -- in the times when growth slows, then we would see an increase in margins, and so what happens is, we had more folks that we were enrolling January 1 of 2017, than we\u2019re expecting to enroll January 1 of 2018. So that means, we needed more benefits -- benefit colleagues to be taking the phone calls in the last quarter of 2016 than we do the last quarter of 2017. So the expenses are a bit more favorable. In addition, as you may recall, we really beefed up the thing last year to make sure we were addressing some performance issues we had there in terms of handling the rights volume of calls. So we probably had a little bit of an extra spend there, but those two things are doing it. But it\u2019s a natural consequence to that. One of the other things I mentioned in the script was that in 2018, we expect to see a more even distribution. So we\u2019re not seeing as many of the enrollments occurring exactly on January 1, 2018. As we get that distributed throughout the year, it gives us better expense management.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Klauber with William Blair.", "Adam Klauber", "HCB had a good quarter. I think you said Global Wealth -- the sale of Global Wealth and also retirement solutions were drag on that business. What would\u2019ve been organic or underlying growth, excluding those drags for HCB? ", "John Haley", "Oh boy, I -- do we have that write-off in? Just 1 second.", "Adam Klauber", "Sure.", "John Haley", "About 3%.", "Adam Klauber", "Okay, okay. And I think you mentioned, in that division, the technology delivery did very, very well. Could you go in more detail, what was driving that?", "John Haley", "Well, we\u2019ve been our -- our TAS is basically -- its benefits, administration, operation and I think we\u2019ve been talking about this for a number of quarters now. We\u2019ve just had a fantastic record of winning there, and the team does a terrific job in servicing their clients and we\u2019ve been -- we\u2019ve just continued to add lots of new clients.", "Adam Klauber", "So those -- as we think those revenues if you\u2019re adding new clients today, we should see those clients continue to add to revenues next quarter, next quarter, if I am correct, is that right?", "John Haley", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference back to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Okay. Thanks very much for joining us today, everyone, and I look forward to talking to you at our fourth quarter earnings call in February.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

After our prepared remarks, we'll open the conference call for your questions.", "Now I'll turn the call over to John Haley.", "John Haley", "Thanks, Aida, and good morning, everyone. Today we'll review the fourth quarter and the full year 2017 results, as well as provide outlook for 2018. Closing out the fourth quarter of 2017 signified the end of the second year of our three year integration plan. 2017 was an eventful year. We completed a number of organizational changes and corporate initiatives during the year and we made great headway in advancing our innovation efforts.", "From an organizational perspective, our key priority was finalizing the restructuring of the Corporate Risk and Broking business with a specific objective of achieving revenue growth in North America by the third quarter of 2017. This was accomplished as planned. The operational improvement program concluded as of December 31 with $95 million of gross savings and we achieved our multiyear goal of $325 million of annual gross savings.", "As a result of an extensive review of our portfolio of operations, we divested approximately 10 businesses including a portfolio of programs and executed a couple small bolt-on acquisitions. Last, we added some key talent such as Mike Burwell who came on board as our new Chief Financial Officer in October. Mike has certainly hit the ground running and I couldn't be more pleased with the transition.", "From an innovation perspective, we introduced our first CEO Circle Award, a program meant to encourage innovation among our colleagues and to provide a path to bring the best ideas to market. We introduced a number of new solutions and analytics during the year and I'd like to highlight just two of the new client solutions we are very excited about; the Asset Management Exchange or AMX and our proprietary benefits accounts platform.", "AMX is a new market place designed to transform institutional investment for the benefit of the end saver. It aims to create a smarter, easier and cheaper way to connect asset owners to those who manage their money. We are very pleased with the reception we received from the UK and Ireland markets in a relatively short time frame. As of the end of December 2017, AMX had over $3 billion in assets under management and we are planning on expanding into several other markets during 2018.", "The second initiative is our benefit accounts or accounts business, which is the administration tool for account such as health savings and health retirement accounts. We received our non-bank custodial status last year and enhanced our accounts proprietary platform to integrate with our marketplace and health and welfare administration systems for a seamless transition for our clients.", "Ultimately, we anticipate that Willis Towers Watson's account platform will eliminate the need for us to use third party providers in the future. We limited the release to a small number of clients this past enrollment season. We are very pleased with the preliminary results thus far and we plan to continue to expand the program in 2018.", "So, moving on to our merger synergy objectives. The original merger objectives included decreasing the tax rate from approximately 34% to 25% by the end of 2017, and realizing $100 million to $125 million in cost savings as we exited 2018. We surpassed our tax goal in the first year of the merger with the 21% adjusted tax rate and we continue to be under our goal with a 22% adjusted tax rate for 2017.", "Turning to the cost savings goal, on a merger to-date basis, we've saved almost $130 million and we are raising our savings goal to $175 million as a run rate as we exit 2018. Mike will talk about these efforts a bit later in the call.", "Our merger objectives also identified three specific areas of revenue synergies; global health solutions, the U.S. mid-market exchange, and large market P&C. We've already achieved more than 70% of our three year global health solutions synergy sales goals. Our sales pipeline continues to be strong and we expect to achieve our revenue goal in 2018.", "As we mentioned on our last call, the mid-market healthcare marketplace sales were muted in 2017 as compared to 2016. We added several large former Willis' clients last year and we believe that the ACA debate may have delayed decision making for the fall 2017 enrollment period. We continue to believe there are significant potential for the mid-market exchange business and we are focused on its growth.", "Through the end of 2017, we had approximately $50 million in synergy sales. Given our cumulative sales through 2017 and a new business pipeline, we believe that we'll be at the lower end of the $100 million to $250 million goals as we exit 2018.", "Turning to the P&C synergies, we had about 70 new client wins in the large marketplace with merger to-date sales of more than $100 million. We anticipate those revenues being recognized over a three year period in most cases. We are happy with the overall traction in acquiring new clients in the large marketplace, but our average sale size has been less than our original estimates.", "We continue to build our pipeline and add to our talent base. We anticipate we'll end 2018 with about $150 million of revenue synergies sales rather than the $200 million original merger goal. While this would be a bit short of our original goal, it's clear that the U.S. large market space provides a significant long-term growth opportunity for Willis Towers Watson.", "Finally, we've seen revenue synergies develop between Reinsurance and Insurance Consulting and Technology or ICT teams. Now this wasn't a revenue synergy we discussed publicly at the time of the merger, but we recognize that these two groups had relationships and solutions that complemented one another. We've sold more than $25 million of reinsurance broking and consulting work as these groups have been teaming up and utilizing one another's tools and analytics.", "So, now let's turn to our results. Reported revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.1 billion, up 8% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter and up 5% on a constant currency and up 6% percent on an organic basis. Reported revenues included $54 million of positive currency movement. We observe growth in all our segments and regions for the quarter.", "Reported revenues for the year were $8.2 billion, up 4% as compared to the prior year and up 4% on a constant currency basis, and up 5% on an organic basis. Reported revenues included $27 million of negative currency movement. Adjusted revenues for the year were up 3% as compared to the prior year and up 4% on both the constant currency and organic basis.", "Net income for the fourth quarter was $253 million as compared to the prior year fourth quarter net income of $148 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $484 million or 23.3% of total revenues as compared to the prior year fourth adjusted EBITDA of $419 million or 21.7% of total revenues. This was an increase of 160 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin.", "For the quarter, diluted earnings per share were $1.84 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.21. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a $0.04 positive impact from the fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS.", "Net income for the year was $592 million as compared to the prior year net income of $438 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $1.9 billion or 23.2% of total revenues as compared to the prior year adjusted EBITDA of $1.77 billion or 22.3% of adjusted revenues. This was an increase of 90 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin.", "For calendar 2017, diluted earnings per share were $4.18 and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.51. Currency fluctuations net of hedging had a negative impact of $0.12 on the 2017 adjusted diluted EPS.", "Now let's look at each of the segments in some more detail. As a reminder, beginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affected our segment results. These changes were detailed in the Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017. All of the revenue results discussed in the segment detail and guidance reflect commissions and fees or C&F on a constant currency basis, unless specifically stated otherwise.", "Our segment margins are calculated using total segment revenues and are before consideration of unallocated corporate costs such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs and certain transaction and integration expenses resulting from mergers and acquisitions, as well as the other items which we consider non-core to our operating results. The segment results include discretionary compensation.", "For the fourth quarter, total segment commissions and fees grew 5% on a constant currency basis and 6% on an organic basis. Human Capital & Benefits or HCB commissions and fees fourth quarter growth was 2% and organic growth was 4% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Our Technology and Administration Solutions or TAS commissions and fees increased by 15%. All regions had strong commissions and fees growth due to new client implementations. In addition to implementing new clients, we've been providing additional support for existing clients in Great Britain with respect of legislative changes that we've discussed in previous calls.", "Health and Benefits commissions and fees declined in the fourth quarter by 4%, primarily as a result of the sale of our Global Wealth Solutions business in the international region. Organic H&B growth was 4%. North America's large market continued to see strong growth in both project work and product sales, which was offset slightly by a decline in the middle market C&F. Great Britain C&F grew as a result of global health solution implementations.", "Talent & Rewards fourth quarter commissions and fees grew 4% primarily due to an increase in corporate transaction projects, software sales and in compensation survey revenues. This growth was slightly offset by lower demand in the advisory businesses in North America. Retirement commissions and fees growth was 3%. Great Britain led the C&F growth for the segment as a result of additional work generated by pension legislation and derisking projects.", "North America C&F grew as a result of increased consulting and administration work despite the lower demand for Bulk Lump Sum work. International also had strong growth in large part due to our acquisition of Russell's actuarial business in Australia earlier this year as well as an increase in consulting demand in Greater China. The fourth quarter operating margin for the HCB segment was 22%, flat from the prior year fourth quarter. The margin reflects some planned segment investments and restructuring charges.", "For the full year HCB C&F revenues grew 2% with 2% growth on a constant currency basis and 3% growth on organic basis and had an operating margin of 24%. Overall, we continue to have a very positive outlook for the HCB business in 2018.", "Now turning to Corporate Risk & Broking or CRB. Fourth quarter constant currency and organic commissions and fees were up 7% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. North America CRB had solid growth of 4% driven by increased new business, strong retention and forensic accounting claim work related to increased natural disasters. International had 20% C&F growth as a result of strong growth in Latin America especially in Brazil and energy related business in CEEMEA.", "Asia had solid growth as a result of new business and soft comparable in the fourth quarter of 2016. Western Europe C&F grew by 7% led by performance in large accounts in Iberia, France and Italy. Great Britain commissions and fees increased by about 1% due to growth in the natural resources and energy lines, which was partially offset by a decline in retail and the delay of a large renewal to 2018. Client retention was approximately 93% this quarter.", "The CRB segment had a 28% operating margin as compared to 29% in the prior year fourth quarter. The margin decrease is due in part to a planned increase in corporate allocation related to the Gras Savoye acquisition and a one-time credit in the fourth quarter last year.", "For the full year of 2017, CRB C&F revenues grew 4% on a reported constant currency and organic basis and had an operating margin of 18%. We're pleased with the momentum in our CRB business globally.", "Now to Investment, Risk & Reinsurance or IRR. Constant currency commissions and fees for the fourth quarter increased 2% and organic increased 4% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. As a reminder, the Reinsurance line of business represents treaty based reinsurance with some facultative business produced in wholesale. The bulk of our facultative reinsurance results are captured in the CRB segment.", "Wholesale C&F grew by 8% due to new marine business and favorable timing. Insurance Consulting and Technology or ICT had 8% C&F growth driven by strong software sales. Reinsurance commissions and fees declined by 1% in the fourth quarter. Growth in International was offset by softness in North America and adverse timing in specialty. However, as a result of improved investment returns, total reinsurance revenues remained flat for the quarter.", "Investment commissions were down slightly, but overall revenues increased by about 1% as a result of increased performance fees and delegated client wins. Max Matthiessen grew by 7% through strong new business and increased assets under management. Segment commissions and fees included a decline in the portfolio and underwriting business as a result of the divestiture of many of our small programs.", "For the fourth quarter, the IRR segment had a 2% operating margin down from 8% for the prior year fourth quarter. The fourth quarter 2017 margin was impacted by planned investments for new technology and analytics and the divestment of various U.S. programs. For the year, IRR C&F revenues grew 2% with 3% growth on a constant currency basis and 4% growth on an organic basis and have an operating margin of 24%.", "We continue to feel positive about the momentum of the IRR business for 2018. Commissions and fees for the BDA segment increased by 11% from the prior year fourth quarter driven by increased enrollments, our individual marketplace commissions and fees increased by 11%, and the rest of the segment increased by 10%. Increased membership and new clients drove the revenue increase in our group marketplace. The Health and Welfare and North America pension outsourcing business has continued to grow primarily due to new clients and customized Active Exchange projects.", "Let me turn to the 2018 enrollments. We had a very strong group marketplace enrollment season as we added approximately 200,000 lives. As anticipated, we enrolled approximately 35,000 retirees in the individual marketplace. As we mentioned in our previous call, the individual marketplace exchange enrollment process is changing as the businesses mature. Enrollments will be spread more evenly throughout the year, so we continue to expect another 45,000 to 55,000 retirees to enroll during 2018.", "The BDA segment had a 22% operating margin as compared to 11% in the prior year fourth quarter. The increase in margin was a result of the individual marketplace enrollment cycle being scheduled more evenly throughout the year, which allowed us to align staffing and costs more appropriately.", "For the full year of 2017, BDA, C&F revenues grew 12% on a reported constant currency on organic basis and had an operating of margin of 21% which represents a 260 basis point increase over the prior year. The BDA segment is in a period of transition as the market and our market approach are continue to evolve. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth of this business.", "So, as I mentioned earlier 2017 was an eventful year. We can't forget that so many of our colleagues and clients suffered losses during the many catastrophic events that occurred around the globe during the year. Our colleagues never lost sight of the important work we do in times of crisis and their client focus was unwavering. I'd like to thank our colleagues for their efforts in supporting our clients in what was a difficult year. And of course I'd to thank our clients for the great support you've given over the last two years.", "Before turning the call over to Mike, I'd like to congratulate Alice Underwood and Mary O'Connor for having the named Women to Watch by the Business Insurance CLM Women to Watch recognition program. The award honors professionals doing outstanding work in risk management and commercial insurance. Recipients are recognized for their leadership, accomplishments and commitment to the advancement of women and diversity in the insurance industry. Alice is the global leader of the company's Insurance Consulting and Technology business, and Mary is the head of Client, Industry and Business Development in Great Britain, and also serves as the global leader of the Company's Financial Institutions Industry. They couldn't be more deserving of this honor.", "Now I'll turn the call over the Mike.", "Mike Burwell", "Thanks John. And I'd like to add my thanks and congratulations to our colleagues for all of their efforts this year and especially ending the year with such strong momentum. I've been impressed by the talent, to drive for excellence and our client commitment that I've witnessed through our organization in particular over the last four months. I came to Willis Towers Watson at a time when our colleagues were in full crisis response mode and they work with their clients to assess the impacts of the recent catastrophes. Seeing this client commitment in action during my first few weeks here was a great introduction into Willis Towers Watson and made me very proud to be part of this organization.", "But now for some additional insight into our financial results. Income from operations for the fourth quarter was $110 million or 5.3% of total revenues. The prior year fourth quarter operating income was $88 million or 4.6% of total revenues. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $436 million or 21% of total revenues, an increase of 17% over the prior year. Prior year fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $374 million or 19.4% of total revenues. The key drivers of this increase were both strong revenue growth and prudent expense management.", "Income from operations for the year was $738 million or 9% of total revenues. The prior year operating income was $551 million or 7% of total revenues. Adjusted operating income for the year was $1.77 billion or 21.5% of total revenues, an increase of 9% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income for the prior year was $1.62 billion or 20.4% of adjusted revenues. Again the key drivers of this increase were both strong revenue growth and prudent expense management.", "Let's move on to taxes, I'd like to provide you with some additional insights into our U.S. GAAP and adjusted tax rates. The U.S. GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 221.4% and the adjusted tax rate was 21%. In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the U.S. tax reform, we recorded a one-time discreet net tax benefit of $204 million in the fourth quarter. This net benefit includes a $208 million tax benefit as a result of the corporate rate reduction impact and the re-measurement U.S. net deferred tax liabilities are primarily related to the merger related acquisition intangibles.", "For the year, U.S. GAAP tax rate was negative 20.5% and the adjusted tax rate was 22%, which surpassed our guidance adjusted tax rate of 23% to 24%. U.S. tax reform is relatively new, and as such we anticipate that the U.S. treasury may issue further clarifications, interpretations or guidance, so there is a possibility that our guidance could be updated during the year.", "Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to have a very strong financial position. In terms of capital allocation, we purchased approximately $70 million of Willis Towers Watson stock in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to approximately $710 million, including the cancellation of shares related to the settlement of shareholder litigation.", "And as you may recall, our expectation was that the buyback was about $0.5 billion of shares for 2017. Over the last two years, we have repurchased or cancelled on the 8.4 million shares, as we believe this was in the best interest of our shareholders. We also increased the dividend by 10% in 2017.", "Free cash flow for the year was $562 million, a decrease from $715 million for the prior year. The year-over-year variance was related to an increase in payments for discretionary compensation as we had a full year of discretionary bonus payments in 2017 whereas we had a partial payment in our partial year in 2016. We have higher capital costs this year due to our increase in integration efforts. The interest charges and the costs related to shareholder appraisal settlement and our prepayment of our corporate taxes in the fourth quarter.", "Before moving on to the 2018 guidance, I'd like to remind everyone that new revenue and pension accounting standards were implemented as of January 1, 2019. On January 10, 2018, we filed an 8-K report and hosted a conference call to discuss the potential impact to the Company in the segment results. As we discussed on the call, we don't anticipate any material change on an annual basis, but the seasonality will change for some segments as the result of new revenue standard. A more detailed discussion and examples can be found in our 8-K filing.", "The 2018 financial results, we've called this using the ASC 606 standard that our disclosures will include results as if the 2017 U.S. GAAP standard was implemented. As such, the guidance which we will provide you today will continue to be on the 2017 U.S. GAAP standard. We want to ensure that investors have a clear line of sight between our merger goals and our 2018 results.", "So now, let's review our full year 2018 guidance for Willis Towers Watson. For the Company, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be around 3%. As John mentioned in his introduction earlier in the call, we've been reviewing our portfolio. And during 2017 and in January of 2018, we sold businesses with revenues totaling $65 million, so the 3% revenue growth equates to 4% organic growth.", "For the segments, we expect commissions and fees constant currency revenue growth to be in the low-single digits for HCB, CRB and IRR and to be in the mid-single digits for BDA. Transaction and integration expenses expect to be approximately $140 million. As John mentioned earlier, we have already exceeded our original savings estimates of $100 million a $125 million.", "Depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $210 million. The adjustment EBITDA margin is expected to be around 25%. The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be around 24%.", "As I alluded to you earlier, new treasury rules could materially impact this expectation. We expect free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2018. We had previously committed to delivering a minimum of $1.3 billion of free cash flow. The reason for the range as we settle the Stanford claim for $120 million in 2016 and expected to pay the funds in 2017 in the months approved by the court. Although the settlement was granted, we are still in the process of litigating an appeal. We hope this settlement will approve by late 2018, but it's dependent on the court.", "We've increased our integration budget by about $60 million in order to save an additional $50 million in merger synergies, for a total savings of $175 million.", "There are two areas where we see opportunity for additional savings. The first is expanded scope of implementation of our ERP system. We shifted our focus creating a global system rather than focusing on our major centers of operations. This will enhance data collection and greater financial efficiency. The secondary investment is in real-estate and data centers. We've been successful in consolidating and optimizing office and data centers, and surpassing our initial savings goals.", "We expect to aggressively continue these efforts. And I'd also like to address the steps we have identified during 2018 budgeting progress that makes us comfortable in guiding to the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow. We see specific opportunities in the following areas; enhanced operational performance, reduction of program cost and capital expenditures, increased working capital, refining our hedging programs and a one-time non-recurring cash event which took place in 2017 such as the shareholder settlement and prepayment of corporate taxes.", "We plan to repurchase $600 million to $800 million of Willis Towers Watson stock during 2018 and expect to end the year with approximately 131 million shares outstanding. This would be a net reduction of 7 million shares since the merger, and at the top of the estimated range we discussed at the Analyst Day in 2016.", "Adjusted diluted earnings per share, is expected to be in the range of $9.88 to $10.12. Annual guidance assumes average currency exchange rates of $1.33 to the pound and $1.18 to the euro.", "So, before I turn the call back to John, I want to remind everyone that we'll be hosting an Analyst Day in Washington D.C. on March 16, 2018 and Meet the Leader session in London on March 22, 2018. We look forward to seeing you all at one of these events.", "John Haley", "Thanks very much Mike. And now, we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you and good morning. My first question is on margin. So, if you look, organic growth had been very strong and the margin improvement had been a bit slower than expected. So, I just wonder why you don't have sort of like a higher leverage on the margin and what give comfort for like 25% margin in 2018, and that seems like a big jump like 200 basis points from the 2017 levels.", "Mike Burwell", "Kai, thank you for the question. You know we think \u2013 we're still confident and comfortable with the 25% EBITDA margin for 2018. In order to \u2013 we've seen a couple of investments that we've made in the current year. One, we referenced in the HCB segment which is both restructuring as well as further technology investments that we've made there. And second in the IRR segment, our AMX investment is what we referenced and John alluded to that in his opening comments, are investments that we've made. So, we feel good about the margin that we have delivered, little over 23% for the current year and we see a bridge and a path forward and we think that's reflective in terms of what's happened in the current year, but we see an absolute path, the 25% margin and that's what we've touched on.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. Then my follow-up question is on the organic growth front. If you look at across the segments, they increased and the one weak spot is the Reinsurance. Could you talk a little more because some of your competitor peers have, they seem to have a very strong organic growth in Reinsurance? And also, how do you contract your strong organic growth overall versus your seems like lower guidance on the sort of merger synergy.", "Mike Burwell", "Well, I guess the first is, again remember on Reinsurance, we take faculty, and that is included in our CRB segment overall. So, you know when we look at the Reinsurance segment, we feel very good about where it sits and what it's delivered overall when we see it. So, I guess we're not uncomfortable with where we are in our operations associated with Reinsurance.", "You know looking out to future in terms of overall organic revenue growth, we're comfortable really being in that, you know 3% to 4% range that we have historically touched on and we think that make sense for the business given where market condition are and so, I really got no more to say than that's kind of where we are. I don't John anything you'd add to that.", "John Haley", "Yeah, I mean I think, Mike I agree with what you said. I guess the only thing I'd add is that when you look at the revenue synergies, we said, we expect to be ahead on global health. We expect to be at the low-end on the mid-market exchange business and we expect to be about maybe $50 million below our target on the large company P&C, but we have about $25 million of revenue synergies that we hadn't accounted in terms of the Reinsurance at ICT. When you add those all up, it gets to a point which is pretty damn close to about where our revenue synergies were. And frankly, what we're focused on is making sure that we have a company that is growing and if we grow little bit slower in one area and faster in another to counter it, that will be just fine. But we like the fact that we're getting growth from all areas and we have a great deal of confidence going into 2018.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open.", "Greg Peters", "I just wanted to go back a couple of comments that you made. You raised the immigration expense savings to $175 million and you also referenced refining the hedging program. On the $175 million, is that expected to all fall at bottom-line or is there going to be a reinvestment in part of that $175 million? And then can you run through the cost or the savings that you expect to get out of the refining of your hedging program?", "John Haley", "Yeah. So, let me \u2013 I'll take the first part of that and I'll let Mike explain the hedging, because I just get frustrated talking about it. But \u2013 the $175 million, that's part of our merger cost synergies, and in the merger cost synergies, we expect every penny to drop to the bottom-line.", "Greg Peters", "And John, that just \u2013 that comes by the end of the fourth quarter of 2018, correct? It's not something that\u2026", "John Haley", "I say fourth quarter, yeah, that's a fourth quarter run rate exiting 2018.", "Greg Peters", "Perfect.", "Mike Burwell", "And Greg on the hedging program, something John and I have been looking at, I specifically have been look it and really revaluating you know how we do it, what instruments we'll use, what's the length of time that we've put in place, and so we' reevaluated that activity. I think we've streamlined it, we've given a greater focus and tension, et cetera and we're optimistic as we look forward that we'll see enhanced management of that going forward.", "John Haley", "I think we do feel \u2013 we've done \u2013 we've spent a large part of 2017 understanding the hedging, and as Mike says, evaluating it and trying to set up the best program going forward in 2018. And I think both Mike and I have a lot of confidence that the system we have now is better than what we had before.", "Greg Peters", "Does this mean that there is going to be a little bit more volatility in your reported results around currency or \u2013 I'm just trying to read through the tea leaves here? ", "Mike Burwell", "No, the whole promissory Greg is the opposite actually, is a bit less volatility than what we've had historically.", "Greg Peters", "Just the last \u2013 the second question is around free cash flow. I understand your guidance for 2018. Can you just talk to us about some of the drivers in 2017, because it was down relative to 2016?", "John Haley", "Yeah, I think as I mentioned in the comments Greg, you know what we had seen is first is bonus payment, so in 2017 we had a full year of bonus payments that were recorded in 2016. We only had a partial year that was included in there. We did spend some additional CapEx both in real estate in which we've seen benefits and we'll see benefits for ongoing forward as well as well as technology and I mentioned we had paid some taxes in the fourth quarter which we believe were not appropriate tax strategy for us and so we made some additional tax payments in the fourth quarter. So, those things were the principal changes between fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 from a free cash flow standpoint.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Thank you for taking my question. Hey Mike I want to focus more on the free cash flow like the last question, and just asking to bridge some of the 2017 to 2018 guidance. Just with some specifics, so there are some high level numbers that are not going to recur like how large was that tax payment that you made in 2017 that will obviously reduce the tax payment in 2018? What else is sticking out over there? And then, just to understand more clearly, are you expecting to make the settlement payment in 2018 and that's why the reduction from $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion to $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. Just trying to understand some of the moving parts and what are some of the highlights that we can understand that bridge?", "Mike Burwell", "Sure. Well, let me see if I can be helpful on that color. So, first is, you know again coming from 2016 to 2017, let's take 2017 to 2018 just in terms of our thinking. Again, when you look at 2016 to 2017, so cash tax payments you know was roughly in the $50 million range. And you think about it, we had disclosed the shareholder litigation that we had paid was around $33 million and CapEx that you can see in there is roughly $82 million and we had you know the bonus payments in there were $80 million to $90 million kind of range where the biggest pieces that really bridge you from 2016 to 2017. And then as you look out to 2018, what we really see is, you know some operational improvements. You're obviously going to have reduced spending from a T&I perspective, integration perspective and restructuring perspective, and what we see is improvement in working capital and CapEx. So, you know when I look at those components, you know that's $500 million to $600 million that we see in aggregate of opportunities that are there. It's like gets you up in that \u2013 around that $1.3 billion free cash flow. And your last question was, when we expect to pay the Stanford litigation, but right now the reason we did go with that range $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion was if indeed we paid in 2018, then obviously we'll reduce that down to $1.1 billion, expect we don't pay it, we would obviously be at the $1.3 billion and that might get pushed in 2019. Obviously we're at the mercy of the judicial system in terms of how that process moves forward. So, hoping I provide a bit more color.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "It does a bit although, it would be nice if you could get just some brackets around some of the \u2013 some of the elements like $500 million to $600 million, is there something that accounts for $100 million to $200 million. I understand the Stanford is $200 million, but what about some of the other items there.", "Mike Burwell", "Yeah, I mean I think if you look at our T&I, reduced restructuring in T&I spending. You know you are in the $250 million to $300 million just to give you some further information, insight to that.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Okay. And then just in terms of the margins in the quarter, there is lot of talk about increased investment in some of the areas \u2013 in some of the units. Just one way to quantify that, just so that we get a sense as to what was planned and what was kind of accelerated in the plan. And John maybe you want to kind of address you know what are you expecting to get out of some of those investment again?", "John Haley", "Yeah. Do you want to talk about what was the acceleration?", "Mike Burwell", "I mean so, first, again, we have been investing and John touched on it in terms of highlighted it, what we believe are significant investments around AMX and the IRR segment. We're continuing to look to expand that geographically, and so obviously we need to adapt that appropriately in the particular territories in which it's going to operate et cetera. And we believe that that was the right investment to make so that we can continue to leverage that given the positive response that we've seen you know in Ireland and the U.K. and frankly, it's moving at a very rapid pace, and so we view that as an appropriate investment in terms of being able to leverage that looking 2018 and beyond.", "And the HCB segment was you know frankly we thought we needed to \u2013 take the restructuring actions to better align the business and position it for longer term profitability. You know the Julie and team did that and executed within the quarter. We did not include it in our restructuring charge, because we view that as it relates to the prior years and for next year we keep this clear in terms of what was going to happen, and we see that as further productivity. So, we would have been more in that 23.5% kind of EBITDA margin just to come back from a quantification standpoint on an adjusted EBITDA margin basis had we not made those investments, just to kind of quantify and give you some perspective on it in terms of how we think about that.", "Shlomo Rosenbaum", "Hey great. Thank you so much.", "John Haley", "Okay and so let me just Shlomo give you a little bit more color to maybe Mike's thing on the \u2013 he mentioned $500 million to $600 million of free cash flow improvement in 2017 to 2018. And as we look at that and think about the numbers, we're focused on the grand total, not so much the specific buckets. But if we look at the buckets, we're actually planning for operations to be about say 27% of the total, DSO improvement to be about another 27% of the total and then the CapEx reduction to be maybe 45% of the total. But what we're really focused on is the total as opposed to the individual pieces. But that at least gives you some idea of the relative sizes of what we're working with.", "The main investments that we've been making and we \u2013 you know we're doing a little more restructuring to get some of the \u2013 we're taking a little more charges there to get some of the additional benefits in the cost synergies. We have those going on. But this year, the major investments that we've been making in the business, one Mike talked about some of the restructuring we've done in HCB and as he noted, we let that flow through and affect our margins as opposed to separating that out in restructuring charge where we look at this as some necessary restructuring, but maybe little closer to business as usual.", "Mike Burwell", "And John we didn't adjust it out in the adjustment numbers either.", "John Haley", "Right, so it's not \u2013 it's not in \u2013 it's not adjusted at all in there, so we're treating it as business as usual. But we think that will pay off just as the work we did in HCB, the year before it paid off in some better margins this year too, improving the margin from what they would have been. We've invested heavily in AMX and brought that out and we've also been investing quite heavily in new technology and new tools in the brokerage business generally. So, these \u2013 and that's actually the most significant investment we're making right now is in some of the new technology and new approaches in brokerage. We also have some investments in analytical tools in HCB. So, I think one of the things that we were focused on doing this year Shlomo is making sure that we as a company, we're focused on the future and investing in what's going to be generating the future revenue flows and the future profits in 2019, 2020 and beyond. And we wanted to make sure, that was moving ahead as we did this. We're still very focused on delivering the results for 2018, but we don't want that to be at the expense of future growth.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is now open.", "Mark Marcon", "Good morning. First of all I want to congratulate you on all of the progress that's occurred over the last two years. You did a lot of things that a lot of people were skeptical of. So, congrats on that and it seems like things are well within range for 2018. I'd actually like to look beyond 2018 first and just think about incrementally what are some of the \u2013 what are some of the things that you could continue to improve upon as we look out beyond 2018, because it looks like the 10-10 is within range. What areas are you most optimistic about? Where are the areas where the free cash flow could improve even further? How should we think about that?", "John Haley", "So, I would say this I think if you look at our margins and compare them to our competitors, where you would see the biggest difference is probably in CRB and so we think that that is probably an area where we are \u2013 I mean I love the progress that we have made in CRB from the fourth quarter of 2016 to today. If we keep on that \u2013 I think there is further improvement that we can make in 2019 and beyond. And also the investments that I just talked about that we're making, as I said, we're putting more money in investments and making sure that we are at the forefront technologically in CRB than anywhere else. And so, I see that as also something that we contribute there.", "I think there is some things we can do just as a matter of housekeeping and better management that will improve things. Both Mike and I think our DSOs are far too high, and we think that there is some significant improvement. We expect to make some improvement in 2018, but frankly we expect to make improvement for several years, year-on and year-out in the DSOs. And so, we see that as an area that we can improve on.", "And then finally, we've been spending a lot of time on making sure that we're encouraging and fostering innovation. And I mentioned the CEO Circle Awards we have a number of other programs. It's my belief that most of the best innovation comes from the people on the front lines, who are dealing with clients every day and trying to \u2013 they see what the problems are and they come up with solutions for them. And what we want to make sure is that we have the right kind of environment in this company where people can bring those solutions forward and we can institutionalize them and get them out to market quickly. And we think we've done a number of nice things in the last couple of years to bring that forward and we think that will pay off.", "Mark Marcon", "That's great. And with regards to the innovation, I mean that's part of the culture and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the metrics that you are looking at with regards to engagement and our retention, particularly in CRB where you have made a ton of progress?", "John Haley", "Yeah. So, we did our first annual \u2013 our first all associates engagement survey in the early part of 2017. And we did that \u2013 actually before we started to see some of the real up turns that we had. It was in the very early part of 2017. So, it's not necessarily with all the good results we've had here factored in. But it was a \u2013 overall, we were very pleased with the results. We got over 86% of our people responding to it. I think the most important thing was that in terms of feeling about the Company sharing our values and approving the values of the Company and what we were trying to do, we had extraordinarily high alignment.", "We had some things that people indicated that we needed to work on in terms of improving some of the efficiencies in the way we make it easier for people to do the work. We look at engagement surveys as not report cards, but really is areas for us to identify that we can work on to improve the Company. And so, we are taking that feedback. We have a whole program to roll that out. We'll probably do another survey in another year or so. And I expect we'll see some improvement in the areas that our colleagues have identified for us.", "On innovation generally though, we have a new venture investment committee that is a committee that reviews ideas that people have. We have invested a lot in infrastructure to make it easy for people to identify some new ideas to get the appropriate support to develop business plans for them. And to bring them forward, we have a pretty rigorous approach to which ideas will pilot test, and then of the ones we pilot test, which ones will put into development. And I think the idea behind that is to say, going forward, we want to have may be a little bit \u2013 any ideas that we're supporting we want to make sure we give them sufficient support that they get a fair chance to do it. But we also want to have a culture of best failure, so we want to get out of things that aren't working. But we are pleased with the whole development across the ranks, Mark.", "Mark Marcon", "Great. And then just to number of questions real fast. The $175 million in run rates savings that we were going to get to by the end of 2018. Can you just give us a pacing for what's incremental in terms of coming through as the quarters fall through? And then from a DSO perspective, what would be a realistically ambitious goal and what would be like an audacious target in terms of where you can get the DSO too?", "John Haley", "I'm going to let Mike to take both of those.", "Mike Burwell", "Sure. When you look at the incremental $50 million, big piece of that is the continued program around real estate particular as we see that optimization continuing to happen. We have certain leases coming due and we'll refine the program that we've learned over the last couple of years. And we believe that we can see incremental benefits from what we've done to-date. And that's the biggest piece of what you are going to see in that $50 million happening in fiscal year 2018. Coming back on your \u2013 remind me\u2026", "John Haley", "What's a realistic and what's an audacious goal?", "Mike Burwell", "So, I think a realistic goal is clearly getting that down by five days. I think is realistic. Immediate goal every day is worth $0.01 a share, it's $21 million a day for us. So, we see that, I mean I think 20% reduction would be more of an audacious goal that we would have out there in terms of what we would look to do. And so, as John mentioned, the both of us are very focused on it, as well as frankly the entirely leadership team in terms of managing and driving it in a very focused way. So, we understand what it means to free cash flow. We know what it means in terms of creating opportunities for us to be able to redeploy that free cash flow and return it to potentially investors is an important element to that. So, hopefully that helps.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Hughes was SunTrust. Your line is now open.", "Mark Hughes", "Thank you. In the CRB segment, a very strong international organic growth, was there some timings benefits of that, your guidance for low-single digits is consistent with what you've had historically, but seems like Q4 was quite strong, is there some reason it should decelerate that much?", "John Haley", "Well, I think when you look at international you have really a tale of just two very different years between 2016 and 2017. And we mentioned that we thought that there were a lot of things, just a lot of unfortunate breaks in 2016 on international. We thought the actual performance of that business was really much better, but a lot of things brought it down. So, I think we had some easier comparables in 2016. The performance in 2017 has just been outstanding, I think really the whole year. And so, it's a little bit better in this fourth quarter, but it's really good performance the whole year.", "Mark Hughes", "And then, your large case P&C, it sounds like you're making some progress, but would like to make more, is there \u2013 are you finding this is just something that's going to take longer or it is just hard to do?", "John Haley", "Yeah. I would say that I think, well two things about this. One, we put the $200 million goal out there, and that was really taking us from \u2013 it was an additional 2% market share we'd estimated. But it was really about a 40% increase in our market \u2013 in what our total revenues were, because we're going from 3.5% to 5.5%, so a pretty big increase there. We are not getting quite as far along as we thought. But even when we've had the $200 out there, we expected that would be something that we would build on in future years and continue to grow our relative market share there.", "So, if it comes out the way we are planning now, will have gone from about 3.5% market share up by 1.5% to about 5%, and you know 5.5% something like that, and we expect to continue to grow that over future years. I think it's probably, I mean it's fair to say, it's probably been a little bit harder than we anticipated or at least it's been a little bit slower than we anticipated. And so, I think I mentioned we actually are not as far off on the number of cases that we had brought in, but the average case size is a little bit smaller than we had anticipated.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Hi. Good morning. Just trying to tie up some stuff, if I look at the earnings guidance that you guys gave, obviously the 10-10 that you guys have pointed to throughout the merger is included within that. It seems like expense saves, you know more positive on, revenue synergy are coming in a little bit lighter than you had expected in a couple of the bucket, tax more or less about in line a little bit better. So I guess I am trying to tie it all together and just understand how you kind of got to your guidance and maybe why it wouldn't be a little bit higher? And then, is the 25% EBITDA margin goal? Is that embedded within the guidance that you set forth for 2018?", "John Haley", "Yeah. So, I'll give you some thoughts Elyse, and then maybe Mike will want to jump into. Look the 25% EBITDA goal is embedded within there also. I think what I would say is that when we thought about the 10-10. And you will remember from that back in 2016 we did the Analyst Day, we said everything doesn't have to go perfect. We have some things that can balance as to where they are.", "I think frankly, we have a lot of things going right at the moment and we feel pretty good about that, which we think it gives us great momentum going into 2018. We do expect we'll lose about $0.06 a share as a result of the new tax bill. And so, if you take the $0.06 a share and added that to our guidance, we have the 10-10 just about \u2013 almost it wouldn't be quite dead center, but it'd be real close. And so, that's about where we had been targeting the whole time that we thought 10-10. We always said it wasn't a slam dunk by any means, but we thought we had a plan to get there and I think we still feel that way. Mike, do you what to add anything?", "Mike Burwell", "Yes. I was going to add John. I think, Elyse back on the margin, I think we've made those investments. We believe they will pay off going forward. We are obviously focused on variety of different things. As John said, we have a lot of things going right. But obviously we are planning for to drive it as a management team, but we'll have some things that will come up and we think we put the appropriate measures in place, but we think that 25% makes sense and are therefore rolls up to those overall goals adjusted by taxes as John said.", "Elyse Greenspan", "So the 25% is included in the 2018 target?", "Mike Burwell", "It is.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. And then as we think about the saves from the OIP and then the higher merger saves. As you guys come up with this guidance, just because it's really hard for us from the outside to see how much might actually be falling to the bottom line. Is there any way you can kind of talk to how much bottom line savings you are seeing as you think about 2018? And then this might relate to the saves going up, but I did noticed the integration costs that you pull out of adjusted earnings went up in the quarter and was \u2013 and had a plan this year. What rolls on the higher costs there?", "Mike Burwell", "Yeah. So first, Elyse, the higher costs were principally related to additional technology and real estate costs that we had spent activities on. We also had the shareholder suit that came back overall in terms of what we spent additional money on the $33 million that we had as it relates to shareholder litigation settlement was included in there. So, those are the principal biggest pieces of that incremental amount.", "On OIP, as John referenced the $95 million, our best estimate of it right now is roughly around half that we've seen in terms of fallen to the bottom line. And equally we talked about $175 million next year in terms of what that looks like as an exit rate amount. So, I know you're trying to go back to those pieces, but those are the biggest chunks that are included in there.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay, great. And then one last question on, it seems like it's taking a little bit longer for some of the larger account wins that you guys did, pointed to with this merger. Is that something that maybe \u2013 how do you think about 2019, is it something where you see the synergy is continuing, maybe more coming in over the longer term or is it something where maybe the ability, the gain \u2013 higher share in that market might just \u2013 it's either taking longer or do you think you might not get to the original target?", "John Haley", "Now we'll get to the original target and go past it.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.", "John Haley", "Okay.", "Operator", "This does conclude our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. John Haley for any further remarks.", "John Haley", "Okay. Thanks very much everyone for joining us this morning. And we look forward to talking with you or seeing you in March.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.
