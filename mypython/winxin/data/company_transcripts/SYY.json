As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.", "Neil A. Russell - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your patience as we worked through some technical difficulties. With me are Bill DeLaney, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Ben\u00e9, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings.

The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found in the Investors section of our website.", "Additionally, as a reminder, the results for our second quarter fiscal 2017 incorporate the financial performance of the recently acquired Brakes Group. As such, we will reference throughout our presentation today Sysco's financial results both including and excluding this acquisition in an effort to provide you with clear visibility to the three-year plan objectives.", "To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all your questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow up.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning again, everyone.", "This morning Sysco reported a quality second quarter and a solid first half of the year. These results were driven by disciplined volume growth, sound margin and expense management and the contributions from our new colleagues at Brakes who joined Sysco in early July.", "Further, our favorable performance over the past several quarters validates that our ongoing focus to improve our customers' experience with Sysco and to increase productivity in all aspects of our business are key to our future success. We achieved these results across the markets that we serve in the midst of uneven economic growth, significant political change and increasing uncertainty for consumers. All these factors are providing both opportunities and challenges for Sysco and our customers.", "Some data points reflect positive implications for long-term consumer demand such as steady unemployment levels, modest U.S. GDP growth of 1.9% for the quarter, increased consumer confidence and strong financial markets. However, the restaurant industry, which represents approximately 60% of the Foodservice market has not strengthened to the level of growth we have seen in the past. Restaurant traffic continues to show year-over-year declines, and more specifically, recent data from MPD shows decline in traffic of 0.5% for the quarter.", "Moving to our second quarter results, and excluding the impact of Brakes, we grew adjusted operating income 13%; are generating 3% gross profit growth while managing expenses extremely well. After incorporating the impact of Brakes, adjusted operating income grew 28% to $558 million and adjusted earnings per share grew 21% to $0.58.", "Turning to our first half of fiscal 2017 performance, overall, our team executed well and we are making good progress toward the achievement of our key financial objectives. Specifically, during the first half of the year, adjusted operating income grew 14%, driven by gross profit growth of 4% and minimum expense growth of only 1%. The business results inclusive of Brakes reflect adjusted operating income growth of 26% to $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share growth of 25% to $1.25.", "As we enter the second half of our fiscal year, we have positive momentum in the business and are optimistic about delivering quality earnings growth. We will, however, face some near-term headwinds in the third quarter, specifically, continued industry softness, challenging year-over-year comparisons, and the seasonal trough for Brakes will likely impact our results.", "Now, moving beyond the results for this fiscal year, we have reached the halfway point for the three-year plan which we established for our business prior to the acquisition of Brakes. I am pleased with our progress thus far toward achieving our financial objectives to accelerate local case growth, achieve gross profit growth, and to limit operating expense growth. Overall, we have grown adjusted operating income by $350 million.", "Considering our strong performance to-date and our confidence in our ability to sustain our current level of execution, we are raising our three-year adjusted operating income growth target to approximately $600 million to $650 million through the end of fiscal 2018. Joel will provide more details on this guidance increase in a few minutes.", "In summary, I am confident in our ability to both deliver this increased adjusted operating income target and accomplish our strategic objectives over the long-term. Moving forward, we will build on our momentum by maintaining our customer-centric approach in all that we do, while focusing on targeted, disciplined and profitable growth.", "In closing, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our 65,000 associates for their efforts and contributions as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Tom Ben\u00e9, our President and Chief Operating Officer.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone.", "Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect solid operating performance and continued progress against the key levers of our three-year plan, including: delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers; improving gross margins; and managing overall expenses. This morning I'll be providing an update on our business results based on our segment reporting structure which highlights US Foodservice Operations, International Foodservice Operations, SYGMA, and all other.", "During the quarter, US Foodservice Operations, which is primarily comprised of U.S. Broadline, Specialty Meat and FreshPoint experienced local case growth of 1.6%, which was offset by declines in case volume for our multi-unit business resulting in flat case growth overall for U.S. Broadline.", "Importantly, as we strive to deliver disciplined growth as a part of our three-year plan, our continued focus on providing value to our local customers through innovative product offerings, value-added services, and improved e-commerce capabilities has enabled our growth of local customers for the 11th quarter in a row.", "Gross profit in US Foodservice Operations grew 3.6% for the quarter and gross margin increased 81 basis points, driven by a combination of factors including the acceleration of local case growth at a pace greater than our multi-unit volume growth; our category management efforts, including a continued focus on Sysco Brand and new product innovation to support our customers' needs; a full suite of revenue management tools and routines that are focused on delivering a more proactive and disciplined approach to pricing; and the impact of deflation.", "From a cost perspective, our expense management for the quarter was strong and remains a key area of focus for us moving forward. For US Foodservice Operations, during the second quarter we limited total adjusted operating expense growth to 0.7%. For U.S. Broadline specifically, cost per case improved by $0.02 for the quarter, and on a fuel price neutral basis cost per case was flat, in line with our three-year plan objectives.", "As it relates to our cost performance, we've made strides in both SG&A and supply chain. In our supply chain area, we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements which are driving efficiencies specifically in the warehouse. One example is our labor forecasting tool which focuses on the efficient scheduling of labor and results in effective allocation of resources. In the area of delivery, we've made good progress, though there is still more work to do.", "Additionally, while we are now lapping the benefits associated with lower fuel prices from last year, we continue to manage expense through lower fuel consumption and higher efficiency.", "Moving to International Foodservice Operations, which is comprised of Canada, Europe, Bahamas, International Food Group and our joint ventures in Mexico and Costa Rica, sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased by $68 million, both driven largely by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group.", "During the quarter, Brakes performed well in the UK amidst a challenging environment. Brakes continues to make progress in their management of the supply chain within the UK, which is helping them be more efficient and will ultimately improve overall service and reduce cost. Growth in France has been steady, driven by a combination of solid top line growth and a balanced approach to cost, and Sweden continues to produce favorable results as well.", "We are generally pleased with our performance in Canada, especially considering the downturn in Alberta, which has been impacted significantly by the energy market decline. We expect the Canadian business to continue to deliver positive results as we are effectively managing cost and delivering productivity within a recent deflationary and somewhat soft market environment. Additionally, our joint ventures in both Costa Rica and Mexico had solid performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.", "Turning to SYGMA, we continue to make progress against our key long-term business initiatives despite some near-term challenges.", "In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution, and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our three-year plan. I remain pleased about the programs and processes we are putting in place, which allowed us to raise our three-year plan adjusted operating income goal.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone.", "As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the second quarter. Our earnings growth reflects continued momentum from our business, included solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth, and good cost management. The results that I'll cover this morning include Brakes, which significantly impacted our results.", "In summary, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, sales grew 10.7% and gross profit dollars grew 19.2% while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to 17.1%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 27.7% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20.8%. Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by the inclusion of Brakes in our results, partially offset by deflation of 1.8% in U.S. Broadline.", "Moving to gross profit and gross margins, beyond the addition of Brakes, the key drivers of improvement included customer mix, category management, revenue management, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business, and deflation. Categories most impacted by deflation are center-of-the-plate proteins, dairy, and produce. We expect the deflationary trend to continue at least through the fiscal year. That said, we are managing this environment effectively, as evidenced by our strong gross profit dollar growth.", "During the quarter, we managed expenses very well excluding Brakes, as evidenced by only 0.4% growth in adjusted operating expenses.", "As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34.9% compared to 30.7% in the prior-year period. The increase in tax rate is primarily driven by a $21 million benefit to income tax expense as a result of the favorable resolution of some international tax contingencies that occurred in the prior year. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 15.8%.", "Cash flow from operations was $605 million, which was $136 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $331 million, which was $99 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvements in both are due mainly to favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the US Foods termination payment along with improved business performance and working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes.", "Net CapEx for the first half of the year was $274 million, which is in line with our forecast for the year. Spending has been related to investments in the business, including the transformational work at Brakes.", "I'm pleased with our net working capital performance to date. At the halfway point of our three-year plan, we've had an approximate net 2.5-day improvement versus fiscal 2015 toward our goal of a 4-day improvement. This is driven by improvements in all three phases of working capital, payables, receivables, and inventory.", "Our second quarter results include certain items that were related to the Brakes acquisition, including amortization associated with the transaction as well as accelerated depreciation related to our revised business technology strategy.", "Now I would like to transition to a few business updates, first regarding seasonality of our business. As we've stated in the past, typically the third quarter is slower for our business. In the U.S., the coming third quarter will face some comparative challenges, as we experienced an unusually mild winter last year and have now lapped fuel price benefit we've previously discussed.", "Additionally, Brakes business is more seasonal than our U.S. business, as the performance is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. Accordingly, we don't expect the same accretion each quarter. For the second quarter, Brakes was approximately $0.07 accretive to our business on an adjusted basis. For the first half of the fiscal year, accretion from the Brakes transaction at $0.11 on an adjusted basis is ahead of our initial expectations. Looking ahead, we expect Brakes to be modestly dilutive to earnings per share in the third quarter and modestly accretive in the fourth quarter.", "Second, regarding the increase in the three-year target to improve adjusted operating income in FY 2018 by $600 million to $650 million as compared to FY 2015. As a reminder, please remember that this target represents our commitment, exclusive of the results from Brakes, consistent with how we've spoken about our three-year plan all along.", "As Bill and Tom mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance in FY 2016 and year-to-date FY 2017. We're able to significantly outperform our initial expectations to achieve our adjusted operating income improvement goal. We have grown the gap between gross profit dollar growth and expense dollar growth to be larger than we originally estimated.", "Going forward, we expect to continue driving leverage between gross profit growth and expense growth. This includes our ability to manage both our SG&A expenses and supply chain costs effectively. These factors have created positive momentum for us to achieve our FY 2017 and FY 2018 objectives and have given us confidence to raise our target. I should note that the entirety of the increase in planned adjusted operating income growth is projected to be realized in FY 2018.", "In summary, we had a quality quarter, reflecting continued momentum from our business, including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth, and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our updated three-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term.", "Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to drill down a little bit on the case volume trends in the U.S. during the second quarter and particularly around the elections. Did you guys see a lot of noise around that and how have trends been 3Q to-date?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "I'll start, Shane. I'm going to let Tom jump in here pretty quickly. I think it's been hard to really discern a consistent pattern on trends. The numbers for this quarter are a little off the first quarter, but not that much. I think we saw some things around the holidays that we think probably impacted a little bit. And I think I've got this right, I think October was a little slower and then early November was good and it kind of leveled out again. So it's kind of up and down by weeks. Some of it's the way the calendar falls for us this year with the coming off the 53-week year, but I would just tell you it's a little slower out there right now, but I can't tell you that we saw anything that was necessarily tied to the elections. But go ahead, Tom.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yes, Shane. Again, I probably can't comment much about the election and the impact specifically of that. But I think to Bill's comments, one of the things if you think about the local case growth, we've been fairly consistent over the last couple of quarters. The big change in our case growth that you're probably referring to, as you're seeing, is in our Corporate Multi-Unit business. And we did have some slowdown in that in the second quarter, some of that driven by potentially some marketplace type of things, but others driven by some decisions we made in partnership with customers around making sure we're focused on disciplined and profitable growth.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. Just as a follow-up, I guess, and I think you may have partially answered this question. But just trying to gauge your level of confidence in achieving these upwardly revised operating profit forecast, given that the case volume trends in the U.S. have been slowing a bit still. I know it sounds like maybe you're focusing more on the local case volume growth and that's what gives you guys confidence?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "That's exactly right. Obviously, we need balance. We need case growth in all parts of the business, but the local case growth emphasis has been something that we've been very much focused on here over the last couple of years. So I think \u2013 look, there's going to be ebbs and flows in any business cycle or three-year plan, but we're very confident or else we wouldn't have put that out there.", "And I think if you go back and look at the first half \u2013 basically, the way I look at it is because we've been getting questions on when would we adjust our expectations, we're halfway through the three-year period. We performed very well and we are confident going forward. And if you look at the last six quarters, again, this is ex-Brakes, you'll see that we're right on our numbers on an average basis on the case growth and the local case growth. And where we beat our expectation is really to Joel's point, we're a little ahead on our gross profit growth over that six-quarter period and, again, there're ups and downs, and we're right on our expense number. So we've got a nice overall performance here and we just felt halfway through that period would be good to review that and reassess it. And there's always going to be challenges, Shane, in any period of time, but we feel very good about those targets.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "All right. Great. Thanks so much. Good luck.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just some color, again, going to your revised target. Can you just \u2013 it sounds like you just answered this, but it sounds like the upside to the new target is more based on gross profit dollar growth versus better than \u2013 or that your expectation is that operating expense growth will be a bigger driver. Maybe just some color there.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "No. Let me try that again, Karen. What I was attempting to say is, in other words, why did we pick this period of time to an adjust it. And so we're halfway through it. We're performing very well and \u2013 excuse me for a second. We have a little bit of an echo in our room here. So we reported very well on the volume and we're going extremely well on the gross profit for the first six months and the spread with expenses is very good. So I think what we're really saying to you is we like where we're at through the first six months and we've got good momentum in the business.", "Look, in any given quarter, six-month stretch, we may exceed on volume and maybe fall off a little bit on another line, or exceed on gross profit. So I think the message I'd like you to take away from this thing is we're managing this thing well. The numbers may fall out a little different line-by-line but, overall, the level of execution and where we are to this point in the plan is what gives us the confidence to move forward.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "I would just add. Karen, it's Joel. I think as we move forward and similar to what we've talked about when we raised our target from $400 million to at least $500 million, I would say there's a \u2013 it's just a bit of a shift towards a larger percentage of this based on expense both from initiatives that were taken on, opportunities we saw to take additional costs out, as well as in this case probably a bit softer view from a volume perspective. And so I would think about that more from the perspective of expenses than, again, over-performing moving forward in gross profit dollars. To the point Bill made, just additional clarification.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "The ultimate key here, and we've said this for years, at least I have, is we're executing better right now, is this is how we talk about the business internally, this is how we manage it. We got to have good quality top line growth, and that comes down to mix and that comes down to certainly emphasizing the local. And when we get that and we're able to do that with a lot of these initiatives that are bearing fruit right now, we need to grow the gross profit at a meaningful spread above what we grow our expenses at. And that's what you've seen.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from line of Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. It looks like Brakes is performing much better than what you guys had initially guided both in terms of top line and margin relative to Q1 particularly. Can you talk us through some of the initiatives going on in that business that's driving performance? And what should we anticipate for Brakes in terms of top line and margins for the second half of the year?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. I would say Brakes is performing well. I don't know that they're performing better than we would have anticipated. I think there's some seasonal timing issues here that Joel spoke to, and I'll let him give you a little more clarity on that. But they've got their challenges, obviously, in the UK. And there's a lot of really good initiatives going on in France and in the UK, for that matter, and in Ireland. So we're pleased with what they're doing right now, but I wouldn't \u2013 we just can't extrapolate that every quarter, I think. And Joel will tell you more about that.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "I think that the main takeaways in terms of the forward look that you're asking about is something what we've talked about here today. I mean, again, the results of Brakes certainly are more heavily concentrated in the first half than the second half of the year. And as we look to the third quarter, again, as we've talked about today, that's really primarily driven by some fairly strong seasonality impact in Q3. So we certainly anticipate that, as I called out in the script, to have some, I'd say, moderately dilutive impact in the third quarter. I would say offset somewhat by what we expect to have some marginally accretive impact in Q4. But their business is very much, again, very fairly heavily weighted towards the first half of our fiscal year. That's really the way to think about that moving forward.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Joel. And can you also talk a little more about the impact of fuel prices? Just as you start to lap the benefit and fuel prices start to grind higher here, can you talk about the level in which fuel surcharges start to kick in for you and how we should think about the impact to top line and margins for the rest of the year?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. So we talked earlier about the fact that, in this quarter, we actually start to lap some of those results. And that, in fact, did happen. The last few quarters, I think we've talked about a roughly $0.04 impact on fuel price. And so, again, what we always focus on internally is managing to a flat cost per case ex-fuel. And, once again, in this quarter, we've done that.", "The fuel benefit this quarter was somewhat less. It was about $0.02 instead of $0.04. And, again, when I talk about fuel benefit, I mean, fuel pricing benefit, and so to be very specific on that. As so, again, as we've talked about today, some of the benefits that we've been enjoying over the last few quarters we expect to lap as we move forward, and so some of those benefits you've seen, again, you won't see as much.", "Again, as we've talked about, in terms of the surcharge, it's certainly not a dollar-for-dollar impact. As fuel prices go up, there are certainly again \u2013 there's some cost impact for us on the operating expense line. There's also some opposite effect, if you will, from a margin standpoint in the fact that we have either adding or taking away fuel surcharges depending on the pricing.", "But again, I would just tell you as we move forward, for the most part again, the benefit we've seen we're lapping and so we don't expect to see as much of that. Obviously, we take an active participation in some of the hedging programs to ensure we have some certainty from our costs. But overall, again, hopefully that clarifies some of the impact.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "It does, yes. Thanks, Joel. I appreciate it, guys. Thank you.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Hi, guys. Good morning.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, Ed.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Can we dig into the case growth just a little bit more? So your local case growth slowed a little bit, not a lot, right? But the total case growth did slow quite a bit. You mentioned stuff about market, but then you also mentioned revenue management. How much of the sequential slowdown in overall cases is related to revenue management? And maybe could you also just as part of that take a step back and remind us of what you're really looking to do there?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, Ed. This is Tom. So I don't think I actually talked about revenue management particularly. I talked about the Corporate Multi-Unit volume that was affected, but I can talk a little bit about revenue management. And if the question is around do we believe that the work we're doing in revenue management might be slowing down our case growth with our local customers, we have not seen that.", "And so as a reminder, what we're doing in revenue management is really more about creating some processes, some tools to drive a little more consistency with how we price. And so that takes out some of the variability that we've historically seen, and it allows for us to be much more proactive and consistent with our customers \u2013 really across all our customers, but the biggest impact of that's probably more with our local customers where there was a lot more flexibility at a local level in the past. And so we feel fairly confident that we don't have any issues associated with that process being in place and that affecting our case volume with our local customers.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "I guess I assume that when you said the decision on disciplined profitable growth having an impact on case growth, I thought maybe that's what that was. So maybe could you talk a little bit more about what you meant by that?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "That's more about what we call CMU, our Corporate Multi-Unit business. And so what I mean by that is that as we continue to evaluate every opportunity out there, whether it's a renewal of a piece of business or a new piece of business, we're being very thoughtful about those decisions, especially as it relates to some of those larger Corporate Multi-Unit type customers.", "And that's where you're seeing some the volume softness showing up, where we've made some tough choices, and we're going to continue to evaluate those kind of opportunities as they come up and make sure that, again, we're doing the right thing to drive a disciplined approach to growth and certainly making sure that we're keeping profitability at the forefront of our mind as we make those decisions.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "So just as we think about the business going forward now and the outlook into 2018, how are you thinking about that total case growth number at this point, given the headwinds and some stuff you're doing internally?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Ed, I think we're thinking about it the same way. I think overall we were looking for about 2.5% case growth and, if anything, a little more on the local side. But I think what you're hearing from us today, there's going to be some ebbs and flows, and in the short term it probably won't be quite that strong. We'll see. This quarter, as Joel pointed out, is a hard one to predict because of some of the seasonality issues and that kind of thing.", "So I don't think our goals have changed. We've got a three-year plan. And basically the way we look at that, the way we look at any plan, is there's a top line piece to it, and that's the case volume that we're talking about, and that the mix is critical to get it the right way. And then there's a bottom line piece, which is where we raised the target to the $600 million to $650 million ex-Brakes. And then there's how we get there. And so it's hard to predict how much we'll see on the GP line versus the expense line, but the key is that spread, as Joel took you through and we feel good about that, but I don't think we're changing our overall targets. It's just, as you know, any plan ultimately probably gets achieved in a way somewhat different than the line-by-line details.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO. Your line is open.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It sounds like Q3 will have some challenges from seasonality, some weather comparisons. But with the comment about continued industry softness, I guess, one, does that imply that you've seen similar trends in January? And I guess are you surprised that total case growth and the multi-unit case growth is so weak on that side despite the economic backdrop you painted? Or maybe I guess as a follow-up to the last question, can you quantify the impact of some of these decisions around the multi-unit chain side of the business that may be impacting case growth?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Let me start, Kelly, and we'll jump into this before we're done. I think the key on our third quarter is \u2013 this is the one quarter of the year where you've got the third month more than the other three quarters that really drives the numbers. So we're always a little bit cautious. And so I can't tell you that we've seen anything so far. The volume is fine right now. But this is the slower, weaker part of the quarter. And so March is such a factor that \u2013 given that we did have a pretty mild winter last week year, I think what we're calling out there along with the Brakes' seasonality, there could be some pressures there relative to expectations.", "So that's really all that is. But early part of the quarter, we're not seeing any disturbing trends at all, but just real cautious there because March is such a big deal. I think I'll go back to Tom maybe on the CMU part of it.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Kelly, as you think about some of the comments I've made, what I don't think we want you to take away is that this is all driven by industry softness that's creating some of the challenges within our Corporate Multi-Unit, our CMU case growth. Some of it is decisions that we have made and that's what's driving some of that case impact that you're seeing in the second quarter. And so some of those impacts may continue based on those decisions that we made, but I wouldn't read into that that that's necessarily a significant softening, although we called out some from an industry standpoint, it's really more about some internal customer decisions that have been made. Is that clear?", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "That's helpful. And, I guess, the other component of Broadline from education and hospitality to healthcare, can you talk about case growth, I guess, for this group of customers? Or was this all on the restaurant side?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "We don't typically go in that level of detail, Kelly, but I think actually we're pretty constructive on what we're seeing on the restaurant side right now.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. And as we've also talked in the past, I mean, there are segments within the industry that are growing a little bit faster than the core, and that continues to be in that retail foodservice area as well as that lodging segment has continued to perform well. So I think, again, it's more specific to some customers than it is to the necessarily industry or the marketplace.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see if I can get a little bit more color on what was driving the local case volume trend. For new customers added, was that more from existing or was that new customers? And then for declines, I guess, both local and chain, is that from closings, competition? Any other color there, too. Thank you.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "So again, I'd reinforce the couple of comments made on local. Let's start with the point that our strategy has been to focus on local growth over the last couple of years and the reason for that is we believe we can add the most value there for our customers. And we continue to see our strategies and our initiatives playing out and that our customers are seeing that benefit and value that we bring. So that's where you're seeing most of that.", "Look, we feel good about our \u2013 both our penetration in some of those local customers and also our ability to continue to retain the customers we have and get new customers brought into the fold. So it's a combination of all of the above, and we continue to manage that on a day-in day-out basis.", "From a competitive standpoint, I think, look, as we've said many times, it's a very competitive environment out there. It remains very competitive. I wouldn't say that we're seeing anything that's necessarily dramatically different than what we've seen. Certainly in market-by-market, there are some competitive situations that we deal with, but on a national basis, I'd say it's very consistent, it's very competitive out there, and we continue to feel good about our position in each of the markets.", "Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And then I just had one follow-up on deflation. Was the gross margin support that you got from deflation lower in 2Q than it was in 1Q?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "I don't know that we are able to quantify that. I would say we continue to see deflation playing a role, as I talked about. It's one of the, certainly, impacts in addition to the revenue management work we're doing, all the category management work and, obviously, the mix of both our customer mix, as we talked about, local versus our corporately managed and also our Sysco Brand mix.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I wouldn't say there's anything dramatic there, Marisa.", "Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "So really for Tom, when you think about revenue management and balance, right, between investment and price promotion and case growth, what kind of discussions are you guys having in terms of, are we investing enough, are we not, is there enough, is there elasticity, is the macro getting a little bit better? You think about balancing the two, is there some opportunity that might not have existed six months ago or nine months ago to invest a little more or the elasticity's just not there?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "So, John, you don't want me doing the elasticity questions anymore?", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "I figured you are tired of them.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Okay.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "John, you asked a lot of questions in there. I'm trying to kind of work through the various components. Look, I think if you think about the environment we've been operating in, this overall deflationary environment, what we have to do kind of each and every day is navigate that by product category, by geography, and certainly even by customer type. And so what we're trying to do through whether it's revenue management work we've done or certainly even our category management work is we're trying to create the right balance. So that we can provide that consistency to our customers, but at the same time, make sure that we're getting any benefits we can as those shifting markets take place.", "And so I think really the short answer is, we continue to feel good about the tools we put in place, and we think we're creating a much better environment for our customers and, obviously, we're able to balance that for ourselves to make sure that we can maintain the margins we need to in this business. We may trade up decisions every single day. And so I think it's really more about just our ability to have visibility to those decisions and try to balance those as best we can, keeping our customers obviously at the forefront of all those decisions.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And is it easier, when you think about the fruitfulness of investments, better to do it in a more inflationary environment versus deflationary or no?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "I don't know that we kind of look at it one way versus the other. Look, the gross profit dollars at the end of day are what drives this, right? And as we all know, when the market's deflating, those dollars are harder to come by than when the market's inflating. But having said that, there's a balance both ways. It's category by category. If you think about \u2013 not everything is moving in the same direction all the time, so we have literally product categories that are slightly inflating today and we have a lot more that are big ones, that are deflating, like these and like dairy and produce. And so we just have to \u2013 it's not as easy as one or the other, it's really about this balance that we constantly have to strike and, quite honestly, our customers have to balance as well.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "All right. And maybe lastly for Joel. It sounds like your commentary on Brakes is that it's sort of breakeven in the second half. Then would be accretive on a, whatever, $0.11, $0.12 for the year. Is that sort of what you thought at the outset of this? First half maybe ended up being a little bit better. Second half, I don't know if it ends up being a little worse. But is that where you thought it would shake out?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "I think, as I'm really saying here, I think it's maybe a little better than we had anticipated, but I think as we've gotten into this, and again, we're still seven, eight months into the deal now, I think your commentary about sort of the first half and second half of the year part has become pretty clear to us at this point in terms of the way that's going to look. And so, again, I would say overall probably the accretion number's a tad higher than we had anticipated originally. But certainly, again, a lot of clarity for us now in terms of the way the seasonality of the business shakes out.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question here. Two fast ones. I'll ask them just quickly upfront. First, on the near term, I appreciate the color around the Brakes' seasonality. But for 3Q specifically, I guess, that was one of kind of three larger headwinds that you talked about in terms of last year's benefits. Just wondering if any further color or quantification around the weather as well as the fuel benefit.", "And then, secondly, just in terms of Brakes, this is more longer term, of course. As you get kind of more time and experience under your belt, do you think that we should expect at some point to have that kind of more interwoven within your three-year outlook? Thanks very much.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "I'll start, Vinnie, and just let me take the second part first. So what we are attempting to do here is to continue to be very transparent in terms of how we set the three-year goals, and that was before the Brakes acquisition and to continue to report on that. But I think as we get through the end of this fiscal year and actually prior to that, we're in the beginning of that process now here, beginning to think about our plan for 2018 \u2013 our 12-month plan for 2018. I think as you see us finish the year and then in particular come out in the fall with the new year, you'll see us talk more. We'll be talking about the enterprise. We'll be talking about what Sysco did. You won't probably see as much Brakes, ex-Brakes, other than we will track for the third year and we'll give you color and specifics on how we're doing versus that three-year plan relative to the ex-Brakes portion or the legacy part of the business, if you will.", "So bottom line is, as we get into the new year, we'll be talking about it as one. We'll have a plan that's predicated on that, but we'll still give you color for that last 12 months. The first part again?", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Just in terms of the other two factors for the third quarter, any further quantification?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "I think look, what we're doing there is we've had a couple really nice years here. I think Tom talked about 11 quarters in a row of local case growth and we've had several strong quarterly earnings numbers, and we expect to continue to put up good numbers. We've said all that. I think all we were trying to call out there is that the third quarter has some unique challenges that we didn't have in the first couple quarters as it relates to a mild winter last year and the Brakes seasonality. The fuel wraps, I don't think we're sitting here and saying fuel is going to be any big headwind or anything. We're just calling out some things in terms of just managing expectations between the third and fourth quarter, that kind of thing.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Just to the point Bill just made, we're not calling that out as a headwind. We're just simply saying the benefit we've seen is really going to wrap, and so I think of it more as just a non-factor as much as anything.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Okay, great. Thanks very much, guys.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on SYGMA and if you can talk about just the sequential deceleration in Q2. I think when you reported the first quarter, I thought maybe you would turn the corner with respect to SYGMA. And so I was just wondering if you went through a similar revenue management process as you talked about with U.S. Broadline.", "And then as a related question, was there any unusual impact from any major SYGMA customer or specific set of customers? You cited the NPD data that the traffic that was down 0.5%, but I don't get the sense that the traffic trends or deflation would explain all of that sequential weakness with SYGMA.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, Ajay. Look, as you know, SYGMA is a very, very logistics-oriented, very thin margin, very competitive business. And we are doing some good things at SYGMA. We've got good leadership there and very experienced leadership there. And from a business standpoint, from a strategic standpoint, we're seeing some encouraging things.", "To your point, the second quarter wasn't quite what we planned it to be. We're certainly hoping to make some of that back here in the second half of the year. And there are always conversations with customers of all types, whether they be local or CMU in the Broadline or SYGMA customers to work out the economics on the business, and those customers continue to \u2013 or those conversations continue to take place at SYGMA. So we do expect to see improvement here over the balance of the year, but it continues to be a very competitive business and a challenging one to run.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "The only thing else I'd add, Ajay, is you mentioned revenue management or the pricing. Again, driven by the type of the customers and the way this operation works, we don't really \u2013 we aren't in the middle of that pricing discussion the same way we would be with our other customers because those agreements are between those customers and the suppliers, and we're really handling mostly the logistics components of that transaction. So it really doesn't come into play the same way.", "And the last thing you asked was there any really loss of customers, and there was not. As we continue to work with the same customers here, there is some impact because of that pricing in an inflationary environment that we have to deal with. But I would say we still, to Bill's point, feel good about where this business is. We've got some opportunities still that we're working on, but that's really the headlines on SYGMA.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay, thank you for that. I had one follow-up question, and this is really in follow-up to the earlier questions about the relative impact from Brakes over the next couple of quarters. It just had such a disproportionate impact on earnings in Q2, I think it drove most of the earnings growth. So I'm just trying to better understand how it becomes dilutive all of a sudden in Q3. Is it all a function of seasonality, or is there any incremental weakness with the core business trends at Brakes or any additional cost pressures that are behind your outlook for Brakes in Q3?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Let me clarify something first. We had a very solid quarter without the impact of Brakes. I want to be really clear there. We're on our plan and I'm real pleased with the numbers we put up as we had discussed. To your point, it was a bigger impact in this quarter than it was in the first. And, Joel, I'll let you reemphasize what you said.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "I think, again, to Bill's point, there was a 13% operating income growth ex-Brakes this quarter. But regarding Brakes, we actually \u2013 again, the concentration of profit is very much in the first half, again, versus the second half of the year. And so just the thing really to call out here is just to emphasize the seasonality. Again, they're fairly heavily seasonal business. They are, again, a smaller business obviously than we are as an enterprise, and so there's more impact on seasonality for them than we might see as an overall enterprise.", "And so I would just say that, again, the way to think about this in \u2013 concentrated first half of the year in terms of some of the benefit we expect that they would provide, and again, seasonal third quarter, offset somewhat by a bit of improvement in the fourth quarter as we head into the second half of our fiscal year.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, thank you. The question is really from a restaurant operator perspective. Obviously, your Broadline customer is seeing negative same-store traffic. They're seeing increases in labor costs. And one of the normal places for them to protect their profitability would be going back to their food supplier and just trying to get some margin back from the food supplier as they're basically seeing pressure elsewhere. So I just wanted to get a sense whether the restaurant industry is putting increased pressure on you to maybe give back some of that gross margin.", "And then secondly, can you talk about some of the \u2013 I guess I'll just use the words non-traditional, but it's becoming traditional, things that you are doing with your customer, whether from a technology or merchandising or maybe more value-added food products that actually helps protect their profitability that we don't necessarily see from the outside?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "So, John, I appreciate the questions. So a couple things are embedded in there. But the comments you made about the pressures that the operators are feeling and how is that translating into our business. If you recall though, given the trend we've had on deflation, one of the things they actually have experienced is a fairly significant decrease in their cost of products over the last couple of years due to these heavy deflationary times, especially if you think about some of the products that are center of the plate for them, the proteins and some of those areas where that's a big, big part of the impact. So they're seeing that. That's helping to offset some of the things they might be feeling on the labor side.", "Having said that though, as late as last week \u2013 we continue to meet with customers and talk with them about opportunities to help them drive even more productivity and efficiency. You mentioned innovative products. It's one of the areas that they are looking to us not only for innovation \u2013 think about it as new items \u2013 but innovation in the terms of, how can they bring a meal to the table for less cost because there's less prep time or requires less labor on their part.", "So we continue to have those conversations, and our customers quite candidly are looking to us to deliver that. And when we talk about value-added services, things like our menu planning and analysis, things like our business review, those are the type of conversations we have with them so that we can keep ahead of whatever might be coming, whether it's inflation down the road or it's just other challenges they might be facing.", "So we look at that really as our job, is to create the environment where these customers can be successful regardless of what else is going on in their business. And obviously the food cost and the things we do are a big part of that as well.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And if I'm still on, could you update us on the Sysco eCommerce platform? And maybe I could have asked the question in a better way; with deflation trends now moderating \u2013 in other words, your costs are beginning to flatten out, maybe they start to increase in the next six months or so, do you anticipate the customer coming back to you and asking for more of that gross margin back?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Regarding that one, I'll jump to eCommerce. Look, it's always competitive out there. They are always looking for ways to make sure they can manage their business effectively. So we're going to continue to look at lots of different ways we can bring that value to them beyond just cost and pricing, but we need to obviously be competitive and we're very focused on that each and every day.", "Regarding eCommerce, we continue to see this be a growth area for our customers and their utilization. We've talked over the last year about us getting our platform to a good place, and we feel like we are in a very good place today. We've got a competitive tool out there that our customers are using, and we see customers in the 20% plus range in some markets who are leveraging eCommerce now.", "So we continue to see this being an opportunity for customers to order in a different way, but as we've also said, our approach has been more around giving them choice, whether that's through their marketing associate, our salesperson calling in, or ordering online, they've got that ability. But we do see the online or the eCommerce component of that continuing to grow.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi. I just actually had a follow up with respect to your goals. There hasn't really been any discussion about ROIC. Obviously your original goal for ROIC were in that 15% range. Any color on where you think you can get that I guess given the raised guidance on the operating profit?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Sure, Karen. I'll start, and Joel, jump in here real quick. So the goal we called out, again pre-Brakes, was 15%. And I would tell you, without the Brakes transaction, we're trending very nicely toward that goal right now. We also said obviously when we announced the Brakes deal that that would impact return on capital, so will delay us to some extent to get back to that number. But again ex-Brakes, we're performing well and I think, Joel, you might want to just talk about the CapEx and working capital?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I would just reiterate that I mean I think \u2013 I'm actually very pleased with our return on invested capital performance ex-Brakes and in terms of achieving that goal, and certainly I think we're in a good place there as we speak today. With Brakes, also pleased there, and but it's \u2013 so that is somewhat dilutive.", "From a CapEx perspective, one of the things we called out is we certainly are on track in terms of our capital spend. Feel good about that both from the way that we've both proactively and in a disciplined way invested in our business both here in the US and Canada and then of course as well as some of the transformational work is with Brakes.", "And from a working capital perspective we continue to perform well. And so, again, talked about the fact that we've gotten about 2.5 days towards our goal of 4 days really across the three areas, and so in general, again, feel pretty good about the way that we are heading at that from ROIC perspective.", "Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets", "Great, thanks so much.", "Operator", "And there seems to be no further questions at this time.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions.", "I would like to turn the conference over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Neil A. Russell - Vice President, Investor Relations, Sysco Corp.", "Thanks, Don. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2015 earnings call. Joining me in Houston today are: Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Accounting Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings.

In addition, all references to case volume include total Broadline and SYGMA combined, unless otherwise noted.", "To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. Finally, we will be hosting an Investor Day on September 15 in New York and look forward to seeing some of you there.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.", "Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance, an excellent progress in several key initiatives that have begun to provide a strong foundation for value creation. Our favorable operating performance was driven by providing our customers with exceptional service, growing our business with both locally and corporate-managed customers, and stabilizing our gross margins.", "For the year, we achieved record sales of $49 billion, an increase of 5%. We grew our adjusted operating income and earnings per share by 3% and 5%, respectively. We generated $1 billion in free cash flow. We earned a return on invested capital of 13% on an adjusted basis. We increased our dividend for the 46th time in our history and distributed nearly $700 million in dividends to our shareholders.", "In addition and subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, we announced a $3 billion, two-year share buyback program that will more effectively leverage our strong balance sheet and return additional capital to shareholders. It is important to note that these accomplishments were achieved with minimal disruption from the U.S. Foods merger planning and litigation processes that continued throughout the entire fiscal year. And I'm extremely appreciative and proud of all of our associates who performed so well on multiple fronts.", "Moving to our performance in the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by the following; we generated case growth of 3.6% in our Broadline business. Gross profit grew 3% in an environment with no food cost inflation and gross margin expanded by 35 basis points compared to prior-year. Expense management trends improved from earlier in the year, and our cost per case in our North American Broadline operations was essentially flat compared to the prior-year on a constant currency basis.", "Key drivers of our improved operating performance for both the year and the fourth quarter were following: increasing acceleration of local case growth; effective implementation of our category management process; improved Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally managed customers; significant progress in developing and growing our offerings for the Hispanic customer segment; collaborative and mutually beneficial joint business planning processes with a small, but growing number of corporate-managed accounts.", "One other meaningful factor that impacted our financial results was the degree of volatility and food cost inflation. We experienced nearly 5% food cost inflation during the first three quarters of 2015 and we managed it very well. However, food cost inflation in the fourth quarter was essentially flat, which unfavorably impacted sales and gross profit growth.", "Early trends in fiscal 2016 are similar, and we expect this to be a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or two. We are committed to mitigate as much of this pressure as possible through ongoing gross margin stabilization efforts and improved expense management.", "Moving to market and economic trends, as I speak to you today, the data is mixed. Consumer confidence and the outlook of food service operators are at historically high levels, but have slipped somewhat in the summer months. Fuel prices at the pump remain at historically attractive levels, which should support higher consumer spending moving forward. Restaurant spend is up, but traffic is generally flat.", "Overall, the market environment appears to be modestly improved from a year or two ago, but it is unclear what the go-forward trajectory for the industry growth is over the next several quarters. Whether the overall industry grows over the next few years at 1% real growth, consistent with the past few years or closer to the 2% in Technomic's recently released five-year forecast.", "We at, Sysco, will continue to differentiate our products and service offerings in a manner that will allow us to both profitably grow our market share and provide an improved return on invested capital for our shareholders.", "I will offer some additional color in our future opportunities after Chris shares his perspective on our financial results for the year and the fourth quarter.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by providing some highlights of our financial performance in 2015. Then, I'll discuss our results for the fourth quarter, and I'll close with some guidance for fiscal 2016 around a few metrics.", "For the year, sales gross profits and adjusted operating expenses all grew about 5%. Sales and gross profits benefited from high food cost inflation in the first half of the year, but were constrained in the back half as that inflation moderated and eventually disappeared.", "Expenses were growing too fast early in the year, but were being supported by high gross profit growth. Expense growth moderated in the back half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted EPS also grew by about 5% this year. One thing to note is that our diluted shares for the year increased 1.1%, because we did not repurchase shares while the merger was pending as we typically would have done. If we had held our diluted shares flat, it would have added approximately $0.02 to our adjusted EPS and 1% to our EPS growth rate.", "We achieved several of our objectives during the year. We exceeded our final three-year target for annualized business transformation benefits. Our successful implementation of category management helped to enhance gross profits and mitigate gross margin pressure.", "For the year, gross margin was flat compared to 2014, after declining in each of the last four fiscal years. We continued our prudent management of capital expenditures with net CapEx of $518 million falling well within our guidance range of $500 million to $550 million. We recorded another year of significant growth in free cash flow on an adjusted basis, which grew to $1.3 billion, up 22% over the last year.", "With regards to cost per case, we achieved our revised goal of limiting the increase to $0.05 to $0.10 for the full year. Actual cost per case increased $0.09 per case for the full-year on a constant currency basis and decreased $0.01 in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. It's important to note that our original objective, when we started the year, was to hold cost per case flat for the year. Because we didn't achieve our original goal, we also did not achieve our goal of growing operating expenses slower than gross profit for the year.", "As the operating expenses were up 4.8% versus a gross profit increase of 4.5%. However, we were able to improve our cost per case performance in the second half of the year and achieved our goal in the fourth quarter, where operating expenses grew by 2.2% compared to gross profit growth of 3%.", "Let's turn our attention now to our fourth quarter results. Year-over-year sales growth decelerated to 9% as food cost inflation declined significantly from 5.4% in the first half of the year and 3.7% in the third quarter to flat in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we saw relatively modest inflation in the meat, poultry and frozen categories; but produce, seafood and dairy were deflationary.", "Changes in foreign exchange rates continue to have a much larger impact than usual in the fourth quarter. The strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted them to U.S. dollars, and as a result decreased sales by 1.4%.", "Acquisitions increased sales by 0.4% in the quarter. Broadline and SYGMA case volume grew 2.2% during the quarter including acquisitions and 1.9% excluding acquisitions. This result includes a decline in SYGMA's case volume as we work to optimize that business. Broadline case growth, which excludes SYGMA, was 3.6% reflecting our solid performance with both locally and corporate-managed accounts. We are especially encouraged that local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business has grown sequentially in each of the last five quarters.", "Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $2.2 billion, a 3% increase, while gross margin increased 35 basis points to 17.9%. Our U.S. Broadline business was responsible for the majority of this increase, driven by a stronger relative mix of sales for our locally managed business, benefits from category management and a very effective national promotion for our Sysco-branded products.", "Case growth for our corporate-managed customers remained strong, but competitive pricing in this segment pressured overall gross margin. Expenses for certain items in the fourth quarter totaled roughly $430 million, almost entirely related to the termination of the U.S. Foods merger. This included non-cash accruals for the two breakup fees paid to U.S. Foods and PFG totaling $313 million; $67 million in litigation fees and other integration planning expenses, interest on merger debt of $41 million, and then $11 million write-off on merger integration capital. This was capital we spent on projects that would only be useful if the merger was completed. The vast majority of the merger-related capital we spent will benefit the company as we move forward. We've included a table in our slide presentation to show the expense impact of these items. I will provide more details about the impact to our 2016 financials in a few minutes.", "Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased $36 million or 2%, mainly driven by the impact of higher case volumes, which increased our payroll and more specifically incentive compensation accruals.", "As I mentioned earlier, we made progress in reducing our cost per case during the quarter. Cost per case was down $0.01 on a constant currency basis and down $0.07 when we include the impact from foreign exchange translation.", "Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $509 million, up 5.8% from the prior year. And adjusted operating margin was 4.1%, up 19 basis points from last year.", "Turning to other income, there was an $18 million increase from last year, mainly driven by accounting for our JV transactions, where we consolidate 100% of the JV's results above the operating income line and then back out the non-controlling interest in other income/expense.", "Our tax rate for the quarter was negative, primarily driven by the merger termination fees. Adjusting for these fees and other certain items, our tax rate for the quarter would have been closer to 38%.", "Adjusted net earnings for the quarter increased 5.7% to $309 million, and adjusted EPS increased 6.1% to $0.52.", "Cash flow performance for the year was again very strong. Cash flow from operations increased $63 million to $1.6 billion, while free cash flow increased $42 million to $1 billion. Both operating and free cash flow reflect the negative impact of two items. First, the cash impact of certain items was $231 million in fiscal 2015, mainly due to merger-related expenses. Second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior-year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year. After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $280 million higher, or $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2015.", "Capital expenditures for the year net of proceeds from asset sales increased $21 million to $518 million, well within our guidance and internal budgets. During the year we significantly increased our investment in business technology as we were planning for the merger integration. While the vast majority of these additional investments will benefit the company, even without the merger, we wrote off $11 million, as I mentioned previously.", "We were pleased that our adjusted ROIC grew 70 basis points to 13.1% in fiscal 2015, reflecting the continued prudent and disciplined investments in our business and solid operating performance during the year.", "Finally, a housekeeping item to point out in our segment reporting; we have reclassified our specialty meat company results out of the Broadline segment and into the Other segment, as these operations are no longer reporting to our Broadline leadership. We've provided a schedule in the earnings release this morning to show the quarterly and full-year impact of this reclassification to both fiscal 2014 and 2015.", "Looking ahead, I'd like to provide guidance for a few metrics to set expectations for the coming year. First, fiscal year 2016 will be a 53-week fiscal year for us, with the extra week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. Second, as Bill mentioned, we are starting the year off with little to no food cost inflation, which will create a modest sales and gross profit headwind over the next quarter or two.", "Third, we will recognize additional merger-related expenses totaling $95 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. These will include: $50 million related to the payment of the 1% call premium on the merger debt, which was redeemed in July; a $29 million write-off of professional fees related to the issuance of the merger debt; an $18 million write-off of the bond discounts on the merger debt; a $10 million gain on the termination of the interest rate swaps we put in place upon issuing the merger debt; and $8 million in interest expense incurred leading up to the July 14, 2015 redemption of the merger-related debt. These amounts will all be classified as certain items in the first quarter.", "The negative cash impact of certain items during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 will total approximately $350 million, including: $313 million reflecting the payment of the break fees accrued this quarter; $500 million for the bond redemption premium; partially offset by approximately $15 million in proceeds related to the gain on the termination of our interest rate swaps.", "Fourth, we expect to issue $2 billion in new debt around the end of the first quarter to fund both the accelerated share repurchases announced previously as well as term out a portion of our commercial paper facility. Adjusted interest expense for 2016 will be significantly higher because of this.", "Additionally, prior to issuing our merger debt in October of 2014, we entered into swaps that locked in a portion of the interest rates. These swaps were settled in fiscal 2015, and we expect to amortize about $10 million of that interest expense in fiscal 2016.", "The share repurchase program we announced will positively impact EPS in fiscal 2016. Because of the timing of the buyback implementation, we don't expect to realize a full year's benefit from the reduction of shares in fiscal 2016. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal 2016, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction in average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense on the new debt issuance. In fiscal 2017, we would expect to capture the full-year impact of this buyback on an annualized basis.", "Fifth, with regards to taxes, a normalized tax rate for Sysco would typically be in the range of 36% to 37%. And lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds, for asset sales is $550 million to $600 million for fiscal 2016.", "Now, I'll turn it back to Bill for closing remarks.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Chris.", "While pleased with our progress and accomplishments in fiscal 2015, we recognize that there's still much work to do, if we are to fully realize our vision for Sysco to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.", "The good news is that we have a sound strategy that is predicated on profoundly enriching the experience of doing business with Sysco, enhancing productivity and innovation in all aspects of our business, attracting and developing the best people available and exploring opportunities for growth within and beyond our core business.", "The better news is that we have begun to realize the benefits of several years of transformative change to our business through a portfolio of strategic business initiatives. And the exciting news is that we are now beginning to embed these initiatives in how we do business each and every day by putting the customer first and working cohesively as one Sysco.", "Following the termination of the U.S. Foods merger agreement and utilizing the knowledge that we have acquired through our ongoing customer insights work, we have begun to update our three-year strategic business plan. Specifically, we see opportunities to further accelerate our case growth, especially with locally managed customers through more impactful product and service differentiation together with enhanced sales and technology capabilities.", "We also believe that we can build upon our recent success in stabilizing gross margin through enhanced product innovation, growing our Sysco brand sales and improving our pricing analytics and support. In addition, we see significant potential to improve our productivity and reduce overhead costs throughout our supply chain organization and in the administrative areas of our business.", "We will continue to invest in our business to fully realize these benefits and improve our return on invested capital over the next three years as well. We'll discuss these plans in more detail including financial impacts at our September 15, Investor Day.", "Lastly, as most of you know, this is Chris' last conference call with us. I'd like to thank Chris for his numerous contributions to Sysco over the past six years, and all of us at Sysco would like to wish Chris and his family the very best as they move forward. We also look forward to welcoming Joel into his new role in working with him as our CFO.", "And with that, operator, Chris and I will now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll go to our first question to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, good morning, Ed.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Could we start with the cost control side? Your operating expense growth is better this quarter than it's been in a while, actually and congratulations on your flat number per case. Can you provide a little bit more color here on, basically, I guess, what you're doing within the business? And then Bill, not maybe to steal too much thunder from the Analyst Day, but when you talk about significant potential to improve productivity and reduce costs, could you maybe give us a little bit more insight into what you mean there?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We won't steal too much thunder from Investor Day, so don't worry about that, Ed. I think on the cost side, the way I look at our numbers is, those of you who follow us know, I look at them in terms of what are the key things we look at here? Volume growth, in particular, relative to the market, and within that volume growth it's very important that we see good local case growth, and we've seen that here over the last several quarters. We need the contract business as well, but we need that local business to grow as well to drive profitability.", "And then I look at operating income growth, operating income is always going to be not just mathematically, but just from a business perspective, it's going to be a by-product of the environment that we're in. And at times, sometimes the gross profit will grow faster and sometimes the expenses will grow a little bit slower.", "And so, I think, any given quarter there's always things that move around that could impact the numbers. So, I think as you look at the year, I think I would say to you that basically what we said in the prepared comments, we're pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter on the expense side, in particular, in the supply chain side of the business and really the business itself in the field, where we had flat cost per piece.", "Now for the year, we didn't. We were up almost a dime, and I would say to you we need to bring that number for the year back down into that flat \u2013 up a nickel zone. I'm not saying that we will or we won't, I'm just saying that that's kind of where the numbers ultimately need to get to, to drive the earnings growth.", "So, our plan to go to your earnings, to your Investor Day, Ed, our plan is to become more consistent in terms of how we do that and to take the quarter we saw here in the field and to begin to put that up quarter-after-quarter.", "Now with that said, I also said that we're going to continue to invest in the business here in terms of things that will drive some of the commercial initiatives that are really panning out for us now, both on the growth side as well as the merchandising side. So, it's always going to be a mix, I think, of timing of investment relative to what you think the value of it is.", "And bottom line, I would say, there's some things in the fourth quarter, for example, bad debt. We had an exceptional year of bad debt this year, knock on wood, please. So, that benefited our fourth quarter numbers as well as the year to some extent. So, I would say that somewhere between that 2% growth and the 4.8% is where we need to get to.", "And I would say to you in terms of Investor Day, I think what you're going to hear us say there Ed, is we're running a business here. It's very important that we accelerate our case growth. We see opportunities to do that, especially on the local side, that needs to turn into leveraging our operating income, which we did here in the fourth quarter, and we were up for the year.", "So, I look at the fourth quarter as hopefully a proxy for what we can do next year. Quarters are going to have their own unique volatility, and I would think that you'll hear a message from us that says that we have opportunity on all sides including the cost side.", "But, the big opportunity here is always going to be for a company with our capabilities, with our footprint, with our people and with our technology today to grow faster than the market and to do that profitably and to provide a good return on capital.", "So certainly, opportunities for cost reduction, they are significant, it'll take some time for that to play out, and we will talk about that more in Investor Day. But I don't want to leave this question without emphasizing how important it is for us to grow the business as we did this quarter. I mean, this is a quality quarter for us both in terms of growth, leverage, and the mix of that growth. And I think that's really what you're going to hear at Investor Day. It takes all facets of our business to be in sync for us to go where we want to go.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thank you. And I'll let some other guys go on.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.", "Ryan J. Gilligan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, good morning. It's actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. How would you guys characterize the competitive environment now that the deal is behind us and inflation is moderating?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't think the competitive environment has changed that much at all. I mean, there's still plenty of competitors out there of all types as we've talked about in great detail here over the last year or two. So, I would tell you, I think competition is very, very acute.", "In the short-term, the way I would look at inflation, we have for years said and truly believe that the optimal range of inflation for our customers, and for us, is probably in the 2% to maybe 3% range. That's a level that typically our customers can pass on and do pass on, and generally that's a level that the consumer will accept. So, when we're in those levels we're able to have the best of both worlds, if you will, in terms of a little bit of a tailwind on inflation at the same time. It doesn't hurt demand to any large extent. We very seldom find ourselves in that zone, and right now, we find ourselves in a zone where there's little to no inflation. As we said, there's some modest inflation and some modest deflation in the categories.", "So, I think the way I would look at that is, it's a little bit of a better environment right now in terms of our customer being able to manage their business, and when our costs aren't going up that much, obviously we don't have to raise our prices as much. So from that standpoint, it probably does help in terms of case growth, but in terms of the competitive environment, I don't really think it changes that at all.", "Ryan J. Gilligan - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe, could you just talk about your labor cost outlook and if you think maybe there'll be a battle for talent going forward as U.S. Foods rebuilds its sales force?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We'll talk more about labor cost, I think on Investor Day. But generally, we've got 50,000 people out there and they generally get raises every year. And our whole goal as I was speaking to in Ed's question is, the closer we can get to improving our productivity every year in sync with the labor increase, the better chance we have of keeping that cost per case in that zone that I discussed earlier.", "I don't know that I would \u2013 look, good people are always in demand in this industry, and we have a lot of good ones. And so, our people are always going to have opportunities. I would tell you our retention has improved here in recent months as we've kind of matured in a lot of our transformation work, and I don't expect that to be a big issue for us in terms of retention. But, we work hard every day to provide our people with good careers, and we work hard every day to make sure that we're retaining our best people.", "Operator", "We'll go now to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. Mr. Wolf, your line is open. Please check your mute function.", "Hearing no response, we'll go to our next caller, Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question, and Chris, best of luck to you.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Wanted to ask, you mentioned about some of the technology investments that were made in preparing for when the merger was a possibility. Can you just give a little bit more color in terms of how that does play in with some of your former initiatives that you've been continuing to execute on and kind of what we can expect going forward?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think, Vinny, the biggest that you can expect, and we will talk more about this at Investor Day as well, is while there's been tremendous emphasis, and appropriately so, on implementing SAP and where we are in that, we've kind of turned the corner there. So, on the one hand we've stabilized that system. We've improved the processes and we're moving more toward a modular rollout approach as opposed to an OpCo multi-modular rollout.", "And we're starting to see some good success there. And the most recent example would be in our inventory replenishment system, which internally we refer to as DPR. So, in terms of the base core business, I think we're in a more steady state and mature place there. We're running the business. We're running it well. We'll continue to improve that.", "But I think where you're going to see us go \u2013 and this is not so much a learning, but just a point of emphasis that came out from a lot of the planning work, is that we need to accelerate some of our work on the online mobile platform area. And we've got some things going on there that are very encouraging, and we will talk more about that. So anything we can do here to make it easier for our customers to order and order when they want to order and for our MAs to facilitate those orders would be a very high priority.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks, Bill, and just one other quick follow-up, if I may. In the prepared comments, you had mentioned about working specifically on the corporate managed front. Anything just to call out there?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think the one thing I did call out is this joint business planning approach that we've taken, and it really requires a different approach to doing business because it does require more transparency. It requires a commitment that needs to be a win-win for both organizations and we're at that point. Over the last several years, we've worked very hard with all of our customers. But on the contract side, the large contract side, we're certainly trying to utilize our supply chain network and our footprint to optimize getting product to their facilities and to their restaurants in the most cost-efficient way possible. But there are some limitations to that until you really sit down and open it up a little bit more in terms of what each organization is willing to do.", "So what I'm getting at there is where it makes sense, and it's not always going to make sense. It depends on the nature of the relationship and the strategies of the respective companies. But we are starting to see some really nice progress with a couple key customers in particular, where by working together, we're able to reduce their costs and also reduce our costs at the same time, and \u2013 this is really the most important part \u2013 find ways to grow the business together. So more to come, but that is something that we've been working on quite a bit the last year or two years.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, very helpful. Thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies.", "Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask about the SYGMA decline in the quarter. It was down 8% on sales. If you could, maybe talk about how that impacted the gross margins because the mix there has changed and obviously SYGMA is one of your lower margin businesses. How much did it help the gross margin?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "How much did SYGMA help the gross margin?", "Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "No, the fact that that's down, so the mix is lower there for SYGMA.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay, I'd say for the quarter a very, very modest impact, but probably some. I think to your broader question, SYGMA is in somewhat of a turnaround situation right now. We've got new leadership there at the top, Greg Keller, who knows that business very, very well. And this is a year where we went through some changes with customers. There was some business that we lost that we didn't want to lose. There was some business that we transitioned because it was the right thing for us and the customer. And then there was some business where we had to adjust our pricing, which hurt our margins somewhat. So there's a little bit of everything going on there. We also had some expense challenges there that we're working through.", "So this was not a great year for SYGMA, and I expect it to improve here as we go forward in the new year and in the following years. I would say overall, we're trying to optimize that customer base in a way that obviously needs to work for the customer as well as us. And I think you'll see some more of that next year, but I also think you'll start to see improvement next year \u2013 excuse me, in the current year.", "Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Were there notable losses that we need to carry forward as we model out Sysco in future quarters?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm not getting into specifics, but I would look more at the fourth quarter than the first three quarters probably.", "Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you for taking my question. Can you hear me?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "A quick question just first. You used to talk about street business, and now you're talking about locally managed. Do you think you could just tell us what the definition is? Is locally managed the same as street business?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Meredith, that's a great question. It's one of those questions we get from time to time. So no, it's not the same, but it's very close. What we did \u2013 this is about three years ago, Meredith. We changed our terminology internally to, frankly, bring a little bit more clarity and accountability to the ultimate responsibility for these customers.", "So locally managed business is business where the customer generally \u2013 and there are exceptions to every rule in Sysco \u2013 but generally the customer, the decision-maker of that customer is proximate; i.e., within the selling radius of that local operating company. So there's a high percentage of street business, but there's also a fair amount of what we call local contract business. And these would be chains. And they could be of different sizes. They could be local chains. They could be somewhat regional. They could even be across regions, and that's why I say there are exceptions.", "But, in our world, it's street business plus what we call local contract. And then corporate-managed business is your very large regional chains and your national and international customers, for that matter, where the relationships are largely managed from corporate here and generally with the customer. And then obviously, our operating companies are responsible for handling those relationships locally with the units and servicing those accounts. So that's as clear as I can make it, and there is some fuzziness there in the local contract. But the key is really how we look at the business and it's how we sign primary accountability for these customer relationships.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "That makes sense. I just wonder when you talk about growth in the locally managed business, you could be talking about either small chains or business where it's contracted or business when you actually call on the customer. So the growth you talked about, is that coming from both kinds of locally managed business, or is there more growth in the independents?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'd say it's coming from both kinds. This happened to be a year where we actually lost a couple of very large local contract customers that were spread across multiple OpCos, so that's in that fuzzy category, which we call them local contract because the history of those relationships is local, but they cross over multiple OpCos. But I would say generally and even currently that growth is coming from both.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, and then I just had one other quick question. I did notice that D&A was much lower this quarter than the recent run rate or lower than last year. Obviously, fourth quarter is a true-up period. Is there anything to comment on? And when you talk about cost per case, do you include D&A in cost per case, or is that just simply a corporate item?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "D&A, are you saying depreciation and amortization, Meredith?", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Go ahead, Chris.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So depreciation and amortization to the extent that it applies to business technology, we would capture that at the corporate level. To the extent it applies to something that's at the local level, it's captured within cost per case because it's applied at the local level.", "Generally, I don't think there's anything especially to call out this quarter about the change in that number. As you pointed out, there are some true-ups that occur at the end of every year. We've had probably more than last year than we had this year, so that's going to help your growth rate a little bit. But in general operating costs were much better managed this fourth quarter than last fourth quarter. The number we cited up $36 million happens to be the amount of the increase and incentives for the quarter as well. So, to the extent it went up, it went up for the right reasons. We were selling a lot more cases and rewarding people accordingly.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And so the lower growth in case cost in this quarter wasn't particularly due to D&A?", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It was a part of that mix, but there was no significant amount attributable to that, no.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "To Chris's point, there wouldn't be a lot of amortization in that cost, but there's certainly a lot of depreciation in that number.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There is, to the extent that at the field level, that's exactly right.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, thank you very much.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.", "Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for answering my question. Just wanted to talk a little bit more about gross margin. You called out some of your initiatives, a little better growth with some of the local accounts. But, if you just step back, how helpful was the flat food cost inflation, and where do you think gross margin has really stabilized at?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm not sure I can answer the second one, but let me start with the first one, Kelly. So, look, I think it depends on whether you're talking about gross profit or gross margin. I don't want to be too anal on this thing, but that's the reality of it. We pay our bills with dollars, so gross profit dollar growth is very important here, and we had 3% gross profit dollar growth, which was less than what you saw earlier in the year, but at a time when there's no inflation, that was pretty good and we were able to manage our expenses pretty well. That's why I was saying earlier, those numbers are going to move around from time to time. Obviously, what we need to get back to more consistently is where that gross profit is growing faster than the expenses.", "I think on gross margin, when you're in an environment where your costs are not going up, there's not as much pressure to obviously raise your prices. And that allows you to manage your margin percent a little bit better. So, there's no doubt that that helped on the percentage part of it; but, again, we need to manage both. And after three years of talking about how important gross profit dollar growth is, I'm not going to sit here today and take a victory lap on gross margin. I think it's good that it went up, but I think it's more impressive that we were able to grow the gross profit at 3% with very little if any inflation and keep our expenses below that. That will be somewhat challenging here, as we said, in the first couple quarters, but we'll continue to work at that. And we'd like to get the gross profit growth back up in that four to five zone over time like we saw, but that will be somewhat driven by inflation.", "I think the corollary here, Kelly, is, when we have inflation, let's say higher than normal inflation like we saw, particularly in the first half of the year, that's where it's very difficult to \u2013 and at times not even appropriate \u2013 to raise your prices as fast as your costs are going up. And so, when you have an inflation environment of 5% or 6%, it's highly unlikely that your gross margin is going to keep pace on a year-over-year basis there. So, it's math, but it's more than math. It's the environment that our sales people work in, and it's basically what's the right way to treat the customer.", "So, bottom line, I think it helped on the margin, but it hurt on the gross profit this quarter. As far as stabilizing, let's take it a year at a time, okay? So, we have a year here where we had essentially flat margins.", "And I think what I should say or reiterate here, because we've talked about that inflation or lack thereof, I mean we did a lot of good things this quarter and this year. So, category management really matured this year and helped improve our margins. We'll see some more benefit there in the new year. Not as much, but a trajectory the slope will flatten out a little bit.", "Growing local cases is very, very important in this business. I don't think I can say that enough. So, what we said here is, we now had several quarters in a row where we grew our local business. That's where we provide the most value, that's where we make the most money. And we don't have to grow them at the same rate as the corporate-managed necessarily, but we do need to grow them. And I think that contributed significantly to the margin as well as the gross profit growth.", "And then this quarter and really the year to some extent, we saw the brand rebound a little bit, and some of that was through some promotion work. Some of it's just the natural by-product of connecting it with our category management work. And anytime we can utilize our private brand to create value, that's also positive.", "So, I think there's a lot of things that led to it, there's a lot of things we need to keep doing well and we have some good things going. But, look, it is competitive out there, and I think if we can stabilize margins at this level we'll be very happy with that.", "Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.", "John E. Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Bill, one of the things we've heard is that post the U.S. Foods thing not happening, the promotional environment's got a little bit more intense. Is that fair? Is that what you're seeing? And then how might that tie-in with this disinflation? And does this \u2013 so, we've gone from plus four to zero in a very quick period of time. Does that breed more aggressive competition, right? Because everybody's COGS is going down and they can be aggressive without giving up a lot of margin?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "John, it's been a long time since I practiced accounting. I'm not sure that COGS are going down in the promotion. I think their sales are going down and maybe their marketing expenses are going up depending on how they account for it. So, I don't think that's a COGS issue. Obviously, cat management helped us there.", "As far as the question on promotion, I see there's been some chatter out there. Yeah, I mean, look, you've got a transition that's going on here. I think in certain markets we are seeing some of that type of activity. I've even read pieces where people are saying that we've stepped up our activity.", "And the reality is we haven't. I think we're always out there selectively doing what we need to do to retain good quality customers and business and selectively going after potential new business. So, it's not that we don't promote; but I would tell you, I don't think our promotion activities picked up in any meaningful way from a year or two ago. So, it's out there, I think we're going through this transition period, so it may be somewhat accelerated, but I think that's a little overblown right now.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And then, if you look at case progression, so take Broadline, up 3.6% this quarter, what had it been running? Is that an improvement? And then if you look at locally managed on top of that and you said that has improved, so where has that improved from? Where was it a couple of quarters ago? Where is it today?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I don't know that we give \u2013 I'm not going to let you do the work on some of that, John. I don't know that we give guidance at that level. But I can directionally tell you it has improved, okay? So, that 3.6%, that's total Broadline, it's got about a half a point of acquisition and everything. So, you're looking at 3% organic growth, and I would tell you that that's \u2013 there's a little bit more there on the corporate side than the local, but the local has moved up nicely over the last, I think it's five quarters to six quarters, and it's continuing to grow. So, I think the important part there is that piece of it is growing and continuing to grow.", "John E. Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thanks. Can you hear me this time?", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We can.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We can.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "All right. I don't know what happened there. In the interim, most of my questions were asked, but maybe I could tie it together. I thought the gross profit growth with this inflation was pretty good. So, and you're saying even from U.S. Foods you haven't seen an uptick, if I can be so impolite, your old dance partner there. Have you seen an uptick from them specifically? Or I guess maybe you're saying if so, it's not enough to really change the nature of the market.", "So, when you sound a little cautious on the first half of the fiscal year, is it more on the expense side? Because if the market environment's not changing, you have some internal initiatives to get the gross profit dollars at least going above sales, is it more of an expense issue? It's just you can't \u2013 it's just hard to keep the expenses flattish or to get the leverage that you got this quarter?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "If I came across as cautious, I guess it's just my nature, Andy. But I'm trying to be balanced here and...", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Yeah. No, I appreciate just being straight, so I'm just talking to you.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But I think this is an important exchange here right now. So, I think, I'm really pleased with this quarter. I mean, the quality of this quarter was very good. And we've got some good things going on here on the local case growth side, so we need to sustain that.", "And I think we still can grow some of the other cases as well. So, I think that's a positive I feel good about that. There's not much we can do about whether there's going to be any inflation or if there's going to be a little deflation, so that's where I'm a little cautious. That does impact our top line and our gross profit dollar line.", "And then on the expense side, I would say encouraged by the fourth quarter, and I just would look for gradual improvement there. I don't think we can sustain 2% expense growth with 3% case growth. Okay, I don't think that's a sustainable ratio.", "With that said, I expect our expense growth to \u2013 on a relative basis to be better next year than what we saw this year relative to case growth, relative to sales and GP growth. So, I actually feel pretty good about the part that we're managing right now, and then my caution is that if you look at the quarter, I see that as something.", "We had three good quarters this year. We need to have four next year, and they need to look somewhere around what we saw here in the fourth quarter. But, the lines are going to move around depending what's going on in the marketplace. But, overall, I feel good, but yeah, I'm a little cautious on that top line and GP line for the first quarter, too. Chris.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Hey, Andy, I'm just going to tie it back to some stuff we talked to earlier in the year. We continue to say we'd like to see gross profit dollar growth of 4% or better. That sets us up very, very well. Because of the level of food cost inflation, it's difficult right now. All Bill was really saying is, we're going to have some headwinds on the sales line. We're going to have some headwinds on the gross profit dollar line. Obtaining that 4% is going to be difficult without some sort of reinflation in food cost. The reason the 4% is 4% is because we acknowledge that we're going to drive cases, and that's going to drive costs.", "So as Bill just said I think very, very well, if we're going to have headwinds on the top line numbers, it means we have to control the cost even more at a time when frankly we're driving cases. So that makes the math a little bit tough. So I'm with Bill. I'm very pleased with the quarter. Neither of us are pessimistic about next year or even the first half of next year. We're just, as Bill said, trying to be able to balance with the current inflationary environment and how hard that's going to be to drive our equation.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Good. No, no, I saw the quarter that way too. And just lastly, back to U.S. Foods, they are the number two player, potentially at least in some markets if they were to really get aggressive, could squeeze some margins. Are you seeing them being pretty normal, or are you seeing them ramp it up quite a lot?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Again, Andy, I think in certain markets our people are seeing some of that. They've got new CEO there now who we know and respect a great deal. I think they've got a lot to get through here in the next couple, three months. I expect that they'll do it and do it well, and I expect them to be a rational competitor. But in any given market, any of us could at times be a little bit viewed as being overly aggressive or whatever. So I'm sure there's some of that going out. I'm not that close to it. But if it was overly significant, I think I would know about it. And I don't have a sense that that's a big thing right now.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you. Congratulations on the quarter, I thought it was pretty good.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Andy.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Andy.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Bill, in your prepared comments, I think you cited improved expense management and also higher payroll costs, higher incentive compensation. And so with respect to your expense outlook for this year, overall would you say comparisons are starting to ease? And then can you give any additional breakdown on where you're expecting comparisons to improve and where you see continued pressure on earnings? Excluding the merger expenses and interest expense, I'm just still trying or struggling to get a big picture perspective on whether comparisons should improve this year or at least be a little bit more normalized in fiscal 2016.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Ajay, look, our plan is to grow our gross profit faster than our expenses. And as I said a couple times now, that may look differently in some quarters than others and there will be a little more pressure in the first quarter or two.", "Our expenses this year were high, as Chris took you through, were higher than we planned. And we can't have 8%, 9%, 10% case growth on a currency-adjusted basis. So we had a good number here in the fourth quarter. I expect this to continue to improve on the expense side in the field. There are going to be some ups and downs there, but I'm confident that we're on the right track there. So I don't know that you can sustain flat every quarter, but certainly low single-digit case increases \u2013 cost case increases would be what we're shooting for here.", "On the corporate side, it depends on the quarter. We talked about some true-ups. I mentioned bad debt. So in any given quarter, there could be some things on the corporate side. I would just say to you that as we continue, we have stood up a lot of capabilities here, from cap-man to a lot of things on sales capabilities. There's more to do there, and so we'll continue to invest in our people and our technology to position this company to grow its business and grow it profitably and compete very well and do great things for our customers.", "So long story short, we'll talk more about this in Investor Day. But as I said, we expect to grow the cases. I don't think 2% is sustainable with 3% case growth if we're able to continue to do that. At the same time, 4.8% is too high. So I think you can assume from that that somewhere in the middle is what we're shooting for.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Ajay, this is Chris. Remember back early in the year when we were reporting very high gross profit dollar growth numbers, we were calling out the fact that we were not pleased with our expense performance even back then. It was being supported by the gross profit, but we weren't happy with our expense management.", "Since that time, we've actually done better in the fourth quarter. It's certainly the best quarter we had during the year, so I'm going to be repetitive here with Bill that we were not at all pleased with the overall year performance, but we were much more pleased with Q4; again, calling out the fact that it might be a little bit swung to the other side of being hard to repeat.", "So overall cost per case was higher than it should have been, higher than we wanted it to be. We got it back under control in Q4. And certainly that's the goal as we look into next year, but it's something we have to continue to focus on. But again, we saw real improvement in Q4. We just have to continue to maintain that and make sure that we don't allow the increases that got ahead of us in the first part of this year.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think if I could maybe just add one other thing to put this in context. I've talked about quarters move around. Years move around. And I think if you look at our cost and our expense management over the last two years, a lot of our initiatives matured last year, and we actually saw a reduction in cost per case last year. And I think it was a low single-digit reduction, but it was up in the fourth quarter I believe last year. So we've cycled some of that now. And I think if you look at the two years together, that's a pretty good proxy of what we're able to do, and we're working really hard and I expect us to improve from this year.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's actually a good point, Bill. We were down $0.06 per case last year on a reported basis, and I think we're up $0.04 a case this year on a reported basis. So you look at the two years together, and we're almost back to breakeven. And it's not a bad story, but frankly we were expecting better out of ourselves. So, that's where we have to continue to work.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, great. Thank you. First just a housekeeping question. The Analyst Day is going to be on September 15, I had something else written down, so I just want to make sure I have that right.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We changed it to, I think the original day was September 24. We changed it to September 15, that's correct, in the afternoon.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you. And then secondly, the comments in the press release, we will also continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure. That's obviously a very interesting comment, and one's imagination can run wild just seeing a sentence like that, within a press release especially. So as you've talked and had more time to think about this with the board and perhaps even solicited investor feedback, what do you think that optimal capital structure is in terms of rating? And whatever that is, I guess at this point, what are you waiting for to implement that optimized capital structure?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Actually, John, that's pretty much the same thing we said when we announced the share repurchase. So our view on that is pretty straightforward I think at this point. We kept our powder dry here for quite some time because we've been looking at a lot of different opportunities on the acquisition front, some larger than others, and we ended up pulling the trigger on the U.S. Foods deal, and that required a lot of capital, and as we all know, that ultimately didn't play out.", "So where we're at today is we just felt it was appropriate to return some capital in the form of share repurchase back to our shareholders here over the next year or two. But we still think we need to keep some powder dry here. We continue to look for acquisitions, as I said in my comments, both within the core and potentially beyond the core, whether it be adjacency or continue to build our international platform here.", "So I would just say to you, we're going to do what we're saying here, which is from time to time we'll continue to look at our capital structure relative to what our other options are. And for the most part, it starts with investing in the business. I think we've got a pretty good cadence there. We've got pretty good \u2013 Chris has done a nice job coming in here and helping us get a little more structure and discipline around our CapEx spending. We've improved modestly, but we've begun to improve in our working capital management, so there are some good things going on there. But I would always like to have the opportunity to do some strategic acquisitions if and when they present themselves. It's just at this point we don't need to keep quite as much capital available to do that.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Understood, thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session and also brings us to the end of today's conference.

Thank you for joining us for Sysco's Second Quarter 2011 Conference Call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made on the course of this presentation that states the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

", "Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted.", "With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported second quarter sales of $9.4 billion, operating income of $437 million and EPS of $0.44 per share. Sales grew 5.8% over the prior year, while operating income decreased 5.5% and EPS was $0.01 lower than last year's second quarter. Volume growth was softer than what we experienced in the previous two quarters, and expense pressure increased in our selling and delivery areas. However, the primary factor in our producing lower earnings compared to the prior year was the decline in gross margins of just over 0.5%.", "For the second consecutive quarter, we experienced double-digit rates of product cost increases in three categories: Meat, Seafood and Dairy, that comprised 1/3 of our total sales dollar mix. These are key product categories for many of our customers and absorbing steep and rapid price increases is difficult for them, especially at this early stage of what we all hope is a sustainable if somewhat uneven economic recovery. While we actually produce real volume growth in these categories, we are unable to increase our case growth enough to offset the fact that our product cost in these categories grew at a faster rate than our selling prices. ", "While not impacting our earnings as significantly as inflation pressures, the strategic pricing initiatives we discussed last quarter also contributed to gross margin erosion in the second quarter. We are, however, encouraged by the double digit year-over-year volume growth we are experiencing with the items included in these programs, and we remain confident that the long-term benefits of these initiatives will meet our expectations for profitable market share growth.", "In assessing our performance for the quarter and for that matter, the first half of our fiscal year, we clearly struggled to achieve some of our key business objectives. Market conditions definitely contributed to our struggles. However, there is no doubt that we have opportunities to improve the execution of our business plan as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. Such improvement is a top priority for me and our entire leadership team. ", "Looking forward, I'm highly confident that Sysco is well positioned to grow our business profitably and at a faster rate than our $210 billion market gross over the longer term. We do believe that we are in the early stages of an economic recovery based upon our trends throughout calendar year 2010. However, as we saw on the second quarter, that recovery and to some extent, our financial results, may be somewhat choppy due to the economic challenges that consumers continue to face. ", "Our operating cash flow remains strong and our strategy, which we presented in detail at our Investor Meeting in early December, is sound. As you may recall, our strategy is customer centric in nature with the strong emphasis on operational excellence. Our associates throughout Sysco continue to provide dedicated support and excellent service to our customers. Our business review process is more targeted than ever, and the quality of these reviews improves each year. While fuel cost increases in the impact of nearly 5% inflation in our overall product portfolio created pressure on delivery and selling expenses, we did experience productivity improvements in our warehouse operations and administrative support functions in the second quarter. We're also encouraged by the current level of quality acquisition opportunities in the marketplace. In addition, we recently welcomed Paul Moskowitz to Sysco in the capacity of Senior Vice President, Human Resources. We're excited to have Paul join our team and look forward to his contributions and leadership as we further develop our human capital capabilities.", "Two key goals reflected in our strategy are to grow sales faster than our market gross and grow earnings faster than sales over the long term. Successfully implementing our multiyear Business Transformation initiative is critical to achieving those goals. We are currently well into the testing phase of our work and are targeting implementation in a pilot site prior to the end of the fiscal year. ", "Before turning today's call over to Chris, I would like to emphasize that we are committed to striking the appropriate balance between achieving both our near-term financial goals and investing in our business in a manner that will allow Sysco to realize its full potential over the long term. While some of the unfavorable market conditions and operational challenges I have discussed this morning will likely remain with us for the next few months, we expect the economy to continue to gradually improve. Our clear focus as a management team, over the balance of the fiscal year, is to both support our customers with their operational challenges and improve the execution of our business plan. ", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he could provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter.", "Robert Kreidler", "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $9.4 billion or an increase of 5.8% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimate to be 4.5% for the period. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.6%, and changes in the foreign exchange rates increased sales by 0.4%. ", "During the quarter, our SYGMA division grew sales more than 13% and Broadline sales increased approximately 5%. Sales in the quarter were somewhat impacted by a holiday mismatch that's worth taking a minute to explain. This year's second quarter included two holidays, which are typically lower sales volume days, Christmas and New Year's, while last year's second quarter included only one of these holidays. At each quarter, it had the same number of holidays, in other words, that they were comparable. We estimate that sales would have been approximately 80 basis points or $630 million higher year-over-year.", "Operating income decreased $25 million or 5.5% to $437 million during the second quarter, driven by a decline in gross margin as a percent of sales and an increase in operating expenses. While gross margin increased 2.8% or $47 million during the quarter, gross margin as a percentage of sales declined 55 basis points year-over-year to 18.6%. Similar to last quarter, pressure from high inflation, strategic pricing initiatives and changes in segment mix continue to be the main factors impacting gross margin performance. We estimate that about 10 points of the margin decline related to a change in segment mix, as is similar to the decline we experienced last quarter. ", "As I mentioned earlier, SYGMA once again grew sales at double-digit rates during the quarter and since SYGMA operates a lower margin business, this mix shift unfavorably impacted total margins. As we discussed last quarter, we do not view this as a negative outcome. We see a great deal of opportunity on the contract side of the business, both in the Broadline and SYGMA segments. Our aim is to grow both our street and contract sales over time. ", "The strategic pricing initiatives we discussed last quarter also continue to pressure margins with the magnitude of the impact estimated to be about 15 basis points or slightly lower than the impact we experienced in the first quarter. As a reminder, these initiatives were designed to drive volume increases in targeted categories. The positive trends we began to see last quarter from these initiatives had continued in the second quarter. ", "As Bill mentioned, we are experiencing double-digit volume increases in markets where the strategic pricing programs have been effectively implemented. We believe that this initiative, while admittedly putting near-term pressure on our margins, will create long-term benefits for us in terms of higher volume and increased market share. The results we're seeing in the early markets demonstrate that we're on the right path. ", "The last and largest factor impacting gross margin performance this quarter was inflation. Inflation is measured by the estimated change in Sysco's product cost was 4.5% during the second quarter, even higher than the 3.3% reported during the first quarter this year and a significant swing from the 3.5% deflation reported last year. As Bill mentioned, Dairy, Meat and Seafood were again the categories that saw extreme levels of inflation, with each being in the 11% to 12% range during the quarter. We estimate the impact of inflation represented approximately 30 basis points of the decline in gross margin as a percent of sales.", "While gross margin as a percent of sales was down on a year-over-year basis during the second quarter, it's worth noting that total gross margin dollars, as well as the gross margin we generate on a per case basis, were up.", "Turning to operating expenses. We saw an increase during the quarter of 5.9% or $72 million. The increase was due to three main drivers: First, as we have discussed previously, pension expense increased by $15 million year-over-year primarily due to a decrease in the discount rates used to determine pension expense, which was, in turn, driven by the decline in long-term interest rates. Second, salaries and related expense was higher by $13 million due to increases in sales compensation and other payroll costs. Total headcount was down slightly compared to the prior year. Third, fuel expense increased $10 million over the prior year. Net earnings for the second quarter were $258 million, declining $10 million or 3.8% compared to the prior year.", "Earnings per share declined 2.2% to $0.44, which included a $0.02 benefit from COLI. In the prior-year period, earnings per share were $0.45 and included a $0.01 benefit from COLI.", "Turning to cash flow. In the first half of the fiscal year, we generated $283 million in operating cash flow compared to $146 million in the prior year period due mainly to lower IRS payments this year, partially offset by a decline in working capital. Operating cash flow during the first half of this fiscal year was impacted by several factors: First, during the first half of the fiscal year, we paid $106 million in IRS settlement payments. We also expect to pay $53 million in each of the third and fourth fiscal quarters of this fiscal year for a total of $212 million during the year. In fiscal 2012, we'll pay the final $212 million in scheduled payments.", "Second, we traditionally build inventories towards the end of the second quarter for a pickup in Educational business after the first of the year. Additionally, we typically deliver less inventory during the final weeks of the quarter as sales are often lower during the holiday period. Due to the timing of the end of the quarter this year versus last year, the payables related to that inventory build were paid prior to the end of the quarter. As a result of these factors, we saw an increase in inventories and a decline in accounts payable during the period. Third, accrued expenses declined due mainly to the payment of incentive compensation in the first quarter related to fiscal 2010's performance.", "Capital expenditures totaled $174 million for the quarter and $317 million for the first half, mainly related to facility expansion and fleet replacements and investments in technology, including our Business Transformation Project. In addition, we closed two small acquisitions during the quarter. As Bill mentioned, we are encouraged by the current level of quality acquisition opportunities we are seeing in the marketplace. ", "In closing, while we are making progress towards some important initiatives, this was without a doubt a very difficult quarter for Sysco. The management team is focused on improved execution, and we are committed to our long term goal of leveraging our sales growth. We are making investments in our business that we strongly believe will generate long-term benefits to our business and our shareholders. ", "With that, operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Meridith Adler with Barclays Capital.", "Sean Kras - Barclays Capital", "This is Sean Kras for Meridith. Can you comment on maybe the trends toward change taking share from independent customers which can be less powerful business for you guys? And, I guess, the company can offset the margin pressure from the mix shift over time?", "William DeLaney", "As far as change taking share from independents, yes, that's been a slow but steady trend really since I've been in the business, which is over 20 years. So I think that continues. It's not a rapid change, but it certainly continues to be the case. I think if you look at some of the industry data, you'll see in terms of restaurant closings, most of those are on the independent side, you have a net basis. With that said, I just think it's always important to point out that there are a lot of independent restaurants out there and certainly, we have tremendous relationships with many of them. And when you have great operations or if you're a great operator whether you are on our side of the business or whether you're on the restaurant side, let's say, you're going to do well. So the better operators are continuing to do well both on the distribution side and on the operator side, and we would expect that to continue. But there currently has been a gradual shift from independent to chain. But I wouldn't say it's picking up steam or anything like that.", "Sean Kras - Barclays Capital", "But just maybe how the company kind of offsets some of that pressure over time I guess, the margin pressure implied by that?", "William DeLaney", "Yes, well, that certainly plays right to a lot of what we talked about up in New York back in December which is that phenomena as I mentioned has been going on for a while. For a couple of decades, we had great demographic tailwinds in this business, and the industry growth had slowed here in the late 90s and most of the new millennium, and I think we're all aware of the environment in the last couple of three years. So essentially, our strategy is just two-fold: one is to continue to work as closely as we can with the customers that value a partnership with Sysco become more and more relevant to their success and at the same time continue to take cost out of our system, both in the short term through a lot of key operational initiatives that we talked about in the past in terms of managing our miles and looking at our engineered standards in the warehouse and all that type of thing. But even beyond that, over the last couple of years, we've committed ourselves to a transformational project here, which we believe will position us well to continue to take shares for the years ahead, but also allows us to take some additional costs out of our system.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "If you look at that perishable inflation, do you that it ultimately get passed through? And I would imagine we're getting to a point it's been out there for a while where it could get passed through soon or is that just something that you're going to have to eat a chunk of that, given the macro? Or do you think it does get passed through eventually?", "William DeLaney", "Well, I think eventually allowed to get passed through, John. We're two, two and a half year highs, you've got a lot of these commodities that I'm sure you follow regularly as well. So as I mentioned in my comments, these boxes -- these are expensive boxes in these particular categories, especially in the Meat and Seafood areas, so they're very significant part of the spend budget for our customers. And so it's difficult for them to absorb price increases in the short term and as a result, we've struggled to pass it along in the right way. So I expect that over time, generally and gradually we'll be able to do that, but I think it will take a lot longer.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Do you think you're a price leader? Meaning -- I sort of look at your competitive position versus everybody else, and if you're hurting, everybody else has to be hurting a heck of a lot more. Where you could be in a position to push some of this through and others would follow, or is that a great concern that maybe others don't follow and you end up losing share?", "William DeLaney", "I think you have to kind of look at it in context over the years. I think how we position ourselves still continues to be the case. We want to be competitive. We think if you look at our overall offering to our customers, we feel we're competitively priced and the survey work that we get back from the customers that do a fair amount of business through Sysco they see us being competitive. I don't know that I would characterize ourselves as a price leader, per se. But with that said, John, in the environment that we've been in, as we\u2019ve kind of crossed over into an interesting time now where there's growth in the marketplace, but it's modest growth. The psychology of the market place is probably as good as it's been in some time. But everything feels a little tenuous. So it's still very competitive out there. I think the one thing you're seeing is we're trying to strike the right balance between obviously growing our earnings but making sure that we hold our position with our customers and find a way to grow share where that make sense. Case-by-case, maybe a little bit more on the aggressive side here over the last six to nine months.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "And if I look at the 1/3, so the other 2/3, it looked like inflation there is 2% or less. Are you having any trouble passing that through or that's going through pretty much as you get it?", "William DeLaney", "I mean, you're right. I think it's pretty moderate in the other categories. Other than  the -- I'd say in the core Grocery category, let me focus on that, which is a good percentage of what we sell, it's modest and we've been able to pass out a lot. I think we have opportunities to grow our volumes on those categories, and that's something I think that when I talk about us being more and more focused on executing our business plan, I think there's opportunity there.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "One final thing on the -- you've taken pricing on those specific items and are getting double-digit volumes, is that following through and you're seeing increases in the drop size or total purchase, the baskets that include those items? Or was it not yet generating increased share kind of across somebody's purchasing book?", "William DeLaney", "You're talking about the pricing initiative?", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Yes.", "William DeLaney", "Tough to answer. We certainly -- as I said, we're seeing the volumes as you point out. Our drop sizes, I can't tell you that they have improved appreciatively but I don't know that it has anything to do with that. I still think that's it's a low-volume growth, it's going to be tough to improve your drop size. We've done a lot of good work in that area over the last two or three years. So I think that's -- the whole key to that, John, is we want to grow those categories in those particular product lines but to your point, we want to become more relevant in those areas to our customers. So I'd say that's more of a medium to long-term goal. So I think we've seen it in pockets but I can't tell you that's moving the needle at this point.", "Operator", "Next we'll take a question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "First, on the 80 basis points from the holiday swing, I gather that means on New Year's Day, the restaurants are closed and maybe some of the fast food restaurants are open some. Just trying to -- could we just put that all in Broadline or should we sort of spread it out pro-ratably between the segments? Or somewhere in the...", "Robert Kreidler", "It's an estimated calculation, and it's across all of our business. So we just put it across everything.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Do you think it's more in Broadline, given that those independent stores are also the most likely to be absolutely be closed or some of the fast food stores are still open at least, or am I just trying to make it more fine than you're willing to because it's an estimate?", "Robert Kreidler", "I think you're looking really, really hard. I don't think we would say that.", "William DeLaney", "I think it's more about people being out and about, Andy, than it is who's open, who isn't.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "I guess, last quarter you're feeling pretty good. You said it was the best quarter in a couple of years or so or maybe more, in case volume. And as I look at this quarter, it seems like a fairly abrupt shift. I know you're not saying it's completely rolled over, but it's rolled a lot. So what do you -- I guess, my question really is, do you think that's more something competitively going on where maybe you're being undercut in price or something or is it more the behavior, which I think you alluded to in your press release, but I just want to hear you talk about it, the behavior, the restaurant, tourists, how they're ordering, maybe they're being more cautious with supply, or maybe it's a trickling down to their customers, is the marketplace actually starting to change a little bit in terms of restaurant trips?", "William DeLaney", "I think, Andy, if you go back the last three quarters representative. I think these are -- I'm thinking I\u2019m in the ballpark here, check with Neil, you can look it up later, but if you look at the fourth quarter, our real growth was around 2%, 3% in the first quarter, 1% this quarter, if you adjust for what Chris was talking about there, and if you give us that on the holiday phenomenon. So it's falling off some. I mean you're talking about gradations of a point. Comparisons are tougher. We're now beginning to wrap at least a flat quarter whereas in the first quarter, we were going against the down quarter. Some of it's in the math and some of it is the environment. And we're out there with 8,000 salespeople every day and with our account execs working with our top customers and all of our customers across the country and trying to strike the right balance between price and growth and supporting their efforts to run their business. So I think it's more the choppiness that I referred to that you're in a recovery right now that depending on what you pick up and who you read, the psychology is better, the underlying growth is a little uneven depending on the source. You have seen a big pick up in traffic but you are seeing bigger tickets when people go in. The QSR seems to be doing a little bit better. As you broaden the discussion to some of the articles you see on Retail, there's a little bit of a bifurcated recovery going on here with your higher-end consumers spending more than the regular people. That's a formidable expression there. So I just think there's a lot of different things going on here. And while we are, we believe, in the early stages of recovery, it's uneven, and I think you're going to see some uneven results. But all in all, I'm still feeling good about certainly our people and the effort and our ability to improve as we go forward.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "And so in the press release, just to read from it, it said inflation, I think, caused a -- significant food cost inflation negatively impacted our customers' purchasing budgets. So I understand that for a consumer, the price of something goes up a lot, they've got to cut back elsewhere. But I guess, for a restaurant operator, if the price of meat goes up, why would they but less canned goods or something unless demand was down, less people are coming to the restaurants. So I'm just trying to -- or is there some shifting in their buying habits or did they sort of get cautious, I'm just trying to understand what that means, actually.", "William DeLaney", "So what I was trying to explain there is about a third of what we sell in terms of dollars and for the operator, what I was talking about earlier, these cases or boxes in these particular areas, they're expensive boxes. When you see 10% and 12% increases in significant cost items in terms of your inventory, it does force you to take a hard look at your spend budget in an environment where even if things are picking up, you're still extremely cost-conscious. It's just a general observation I think that the people, I think you agree with this, are still very, very focused on their bottom line and making sure that they're taking as much cost, they're managing their cost as well as they can. So we just have to high cost items, their commodities, it's very easy to identify what's going on in these marketplaces, and so they tend to be highly competitive items.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "That did clarify it. Because I know how much rapid inflation does change behavior, until people sort of figure out where it's all going to spread out.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ajay Jain with Hapoalim.", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "Bill, I just wanted to follow up on that the earlier question about in terms of whether there's anything specific you're seeing that's causing your customers to buy less than compared to the last couple of quarters? And I wanted to ask you specifically if you're getting the same type of customer response to the strategic price investments as you did earlier in the year?", "William DeLaney", "Let me be clear, Ajay. I'm not saying that our customers are buying less. What I'm saying, we believe we had real volume growth and what I'm saying is they're very focused on their spend budget and they're very meticulous in terms of how they do spend their money. So on average, I'm not saying that they're spending less, I'm just saying that they're pretty locked in on what they're going to pay and all that type of thing, and rightfully so. As far as the initiatives, can you give me that question again?", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "Yes, I mean, do you think that you're getting the same type of sales lift or customer\u2019s response to the strategic pricing investments as you did when the program was first initiated earlier?", "William DeLaney", "Well, again, these are different programs and there's different parts of the country that we\u2019re rolling these out in. So I would say in the early stages, we're still seeing similar results. You heard me mention the word execution here a few times, so I mean, it does come down to how well we roll it. So it's not constant in every rollout. But generally, we're still seeing good results as you expect, Ajay, the competition does react to things. So to some extent, we've seen some reaction and we had to deal with that but we're pleased with what we're seeing at this point.", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "And from looking at Sysco for a while, I don't think it's totally unprecedented for you guys to have negative case volume trends when you're dealing with high single-digit inflation. So I'm just wondering if you can offer any comment on whether the inflationary pressures have gotten any worse in the current quarter and is there a potential that negative case volume trends could be a reality in the near term?", "William DeLaney", "Well, we hope not. I mean, what we're reading and what we sense is like I've mentioned here a couple of times is actually the psychology in the restaurant community and the operators is as good as it's been here for two or three years. We certainly hope that, that translates into higher purchasing levels over time. Yes, we're not at a negative level right now. Again, we're barely positive if you just look at the map. Maybe about 1% positive if you adjust for the holiday phenomenon. So I still think that we'll have a good opportunity to see volume growth through all the second half of the year. As far as this quarter in particular, I think as you know from following us from a long time, the month of March is a really important month as far as this quarter, both on the top line and the bottom line because of a lot of the seasonality. So that will drive a lot of results, and you haven\u2019t heard us made a lot of excuses so far in this call but I think the bigger issue we're dealing with right now in the short term is weather. Obviously, last week was a very difficult week in a good part of the country, including down here Texas, believe it or not, actually saw in Dallas. We had some issues in the Southeast early in January. So we're actually  -- when it's kind of a level playing field, we're pleased with the start in January but there are some weather issues out there, and the reality is that March is really going to drive the quarter.", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "I know you've been hiring some more marketing associates and making some adjustments in your headcount. But it looks like payroll costs were still up in the second quarter but at a lower rate than in Q1. So can you just talk about the pace of hiring right now based on the market conditions and whether you might be looking to cut back on payroll costs even further over the back half of the year?", "William DeLaney", "The payroll costs were up I think we've been pretty candid I think with everyone that if you go back and look at the last couple of years, we've taken a lot of headcount out of this company over the last few years. And so there's some limit on how much of that you can do in an environment where you still expect to grow albeit on a moderate level. With that said, we continue to prune and there's been some modest reductions throughout Sysco late fourth quarter, early first quarter. So we continue to do our job and certainly look at headcount and productivity and all that type of thing. As far as sales in particular, there's some operating companies where they have great opportunity relative to the market or perhaps they cut too far in the sales side, and we have invested in those companies a little bit more than, say, the rate of growth this year necessarily so. And I would certainly expect as we go into the new year, in our planning process, that our investment in sales people will be more commensurate with what we expect our growth to be.", "Operator", "Next we'll take a question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley", "This is actually Joe Parkhill in for Mark. I was just wondering I don't know if you mentioned this already. But in the categories where you're seeing double-digit inflation, are you seeing any volume responses when you are passing some of the pricing through?", "William DeLaney", "Can you be a little more specific, you mean in terms of growth?", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley", "So when you're passing through a portion of that double digit inflation, are your volumes getting affected by that?", "William DeLaney", "Actually, if you look at this on a relative basis, we're seeing decent volume growth in those particular categories, maybe even a little bit better than the other categories. I think we're out there, very aggressive. These are standard play items. These are items that typically, over the longer term, are very important to holding traction with accounts and so yes, it's an ebb and a flow and obviously, each situation is different. But generally, we've been able to grow the volume. It's just that the rate of the cost increases is 10%, 12%. And it's hard to -- we're growing the gross profit dollars to your point, it's just hard to grow the price point at that level and still make the sale. So it's a Catch-22, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley", "I mean, it sounds like your volume is doing well where you're making investments in price and then also these categories, I mean, is there a category out there that's weaker than what you expected?", "William DeLaney", "Yes, there is but I'm probably not going to get into that, Joe. There's always opportunities.", "Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley", "And then just finally just from a modeling perspective, I mean can you help us a little bit on what SG&A will look like in the future? I mean, is this something that you're going to grow in line with sales? Or is there some initiatives that you have that could potentially leverage sales in the future?", "Robert Kreidler", "This is Chris, I'll jump in. Obviously, you've heard us talk about the ERP implementation and over time, we expect that we'll be able to leverage the SG&A line. That's not something that you should expect from us in the next couple of quarters. That's only after we roll out the initiative. I think one of the things you're seeing on the selling compensation line, of course, is the commission schedule basically pays on sales dollars to a great extent. And so when you have high inflation, you're going to unfortunately be paying more on the commission line and that's part of what's driving those sales costs up right now.", "Operator", "Next we'll take a question from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I remember last year when your sales looked a lot better than the restaurant industry, we talked about your non-restaurant accounts, which I think are about a third of your business doing a lot better. If there's some comment on the Institutional business, whether we should expect it to grow kind of in line with restaurants over time and just your observations there? And I have a couple of follow ups, as well.", "William DeLaney", "Yes, John, I think you should. A lot of that business as you know is more on the contracts side than the street, but certainly so. We're seeing good growth in those areas. We've got great relationships with some of the big players in those areas, and we certainly expect to grow those segments at least as fast as the traditional restaurant side of the business.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just looking at the second quarter relative to the first quarter in terms of the real sales, much of the reported restaurant industry actually, and I think you're sensitive to this, did show some improvement in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. And I'm sorry if you kind of touched on this a number of ways. Do you think competition is even more aggressive incrementally? Is there feeling better about their businesses, I mean, are you noticing an uptick in competition?", "William DeLaney", "I don't think I can say that. I mean, it's been pretty acutely competitive out there for the better part of a year and a half, two years. So I just think it hasn't subsided. I wouldn't want to say that it's stepped up at all, but it's... Sometimes you tend to think when the volumes come back and people start feeling a little bit better that the competitive forces might lessen some. We're not seeing that.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And the final question, if I may, regarding some of the things that really hurt you on the gross margin line in the second quarter, arguably gotten worse in the third quarter, I mean some Dairy, certain Meat, certain Seafoods are kind of setting new, all-time highs. I mean, should we just accept gross margin decline for the back half of 2011 or is there anything that you can do to, perhaps with your pricing architecture with your customers to allow you to get back some of that lost margin?", "William DeLaney", "Well, we're not accepting it. To the degree that we can mitigate it, that'll be the tail of the tape here. But there are some structural things in the marketplace and just some basic market conditions that we've alluded to. But certainly, half a point of erosion for six months is not how we plan the year and that's not how we plan the second half of the year. So yes, we'll continue to look for improvement on the initiatives that we\u2019ve talked about. We'll continue to work very closely with both our suppliers and our customers to find the right balance here on how all those pricing works its way through the system. So I would certainly hope that we've improved, I wouldn't expect it to totally dissipate.", "Robert Kreidler", "John, one of things we're watching for and you're starting to read it in the press a little bit is about the restaurant operators' willingness and ability to pass on some price increases to the ultimate consumer. That's not something that I think they were prepared to do during the very early stages of the recovery. You're starting to read in the press for some of them at least are thinking about doing that in 2011 and as part of that shift that I think we'd all like to see because that allows the supply chain to start passing through some of the cost increases as well.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And next we'll take a question from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc", "Just wondering in the second fiscal quarter, how much does weather have an impact on your sales volumes?", "William DeLaney", "There were some weather, Greg. I think you saw in some of the restaurant reports in, I think, the Northeast in particular bore the brunt of it in December. It's hard to compare whether year-over-year, I'm sure we had some weather last year in December. I'd say it was a minor factor, certainly not big enough to call out in terms of the quarterly performance. But like I alluded to, I think so far in January, it's been big enough to call out.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc", "Kind of looking out when you do your price initiatives in certain segments, what's the competitive reaction to that? Is there like a delayed reaction within a maybe a step-up pricing or do you just gain the volume and over time does something else happen to change that?", "William DeLaney", "Well, I think anytime a company that's positioned the way Sysco is in the industry does something in a very focused way, there's going to be a reaction. So I think it takes a while probably. These are done, like I mentioned, in different parts of the country at different times. And we're essentially talking under a street type of business. So I think sometimes it takes a while for the customer, I guess, in this case, more than the competitor to understand what we might be doing or not doing and then respond. So a short answer is it depends. But as I mentioned earlier, there's always going to be a reaction especially in this type of climate where the case growth is pretty modest.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc", "Maybe you can just give us a few examples of some of those pricing initiatives that you've done, and I know you've talked about some of that in the past. For example, just maybe kind of just to make it a little bit more easier to understand?", "William DeLaney", "Actually, I don't recall talking about it in the past. We don't find it too often, but there's some competitive issues here. So I think we'll kind of keep it right where we have it.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our question and answer session for today, as well as our conference call.

Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, unless otherwise noted. ", "The net impact of EITF 04-13 will only be discussed from a year-to-date perspective because beginning with the fourth quarter we were comparable year-over-year as this standard was adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. We were not comparable during the first three quarters of fiscal 2007. As a reminder, this accounting pronouncement involves revenue recognition or repurchase product from a customer and then later resell the product to the same customer. ", "The result of this change in accounting principal reduced our reported full-year sales growth by 7/10th of a percent from 8.1% on a non-GAAP basis to 7.4% during fiscal 2007. The lower sales increased our reported gross margins for the year by 12 basis points and it increased our operating expense ratio by nine basis points. ", "With that out of the way, I will turn it over to Ken to talk about how our operations drove the financial results in the fourth quarter. ", "Ken Spitler", "Thank you, Kirk. Overall, I am pleased with our performance for the quarter. Total sales growth was in line with our expectations and we increased pre-tax earnings by approximately 19%. While growing earnings at twice the rate of sales is likely not practical over the long term, it is gratifying that our operating companies delivered such a strong performance. I prefer not to focus on inflation, but the 6% inflation we experienced during the quarter was higher than normal and much higher than that of the previous three quarters. ", "Our operating companies managed their business very well in that challenging environment. I am particularly encouraged by our ability to grow gross profit dollars faster than we increased operating expenses during the quarter. In other words, our operating companies worked with their customers to effectively pass along higher product cost while doing an excellent job managing expenses. While our operating companies performed well under the current conditions, we believe a more modest inflationary environment over time is best for us and our customers. ", "With that said, I'd like to spend some time talking about how we managed the business to increase sales, control expenses, and grow earnings. On the sales side, we look at the number of business reviews we've done, the number of customer-contact people we've added and the level of lost sales we've experienced. ", "Our business reviews have become a core part of how we operate. We focused these sessions on helping our customers grow, so that we can grow along with them. Over time we've seen significant improvements in the sales from these customers that have participated in our business review process. While we expected this growth we are also encouraged that reviews are significantly improving customer attention, in other words growing of sales. ", "The most effective way to impact sales growth is to reduce lost sales. These business reviews are a real competitive advantage for us. The scope and scale of what we do cannot easily be duplicated by our competitors. In addition, we increased our customer contact group by 5% in fiscal 2007 and expect to add another 4% to 5% in fiscal 2008. ", "On the expense side, I'll review a number of important metrics that are vital to leveraging sales growth. In the past years, we saw a real opportunity to control our transportation cost by increasing the number of cases delivered per truck. We have been very effective in improving this by moving from approximately 585 cases per trip in the year 2000 to approximately 695 cases in 2007. ", "We are now also focused on managing the number of miles driven. We are working on a number of initiatives to reduce our miles driven per route. ", "Two other numbers I'll look at -- our errors per 1000 cases shift, and injuries per 100 employees. Errors create customer dissatisfaction and increase our cost of handling, because we essentially handle a case multiple times to correct the error. ", "In the past, we used to make about three handling errors per 1000 cases delivered. Today we make less than one. Safety is of the utmost importance, primarily from a quality of life perspective for our employees, but also from a workers' comp expense perspective. ", "We have reduced our annual injuries per 100 employees from nearly 10 to less than six over the past several years. Although these metrics that I have reviewed with you are a small subset of the ones we look at, we have hundreds of operational metrics. They are intended to give you an idea of the level of detail we use to improve our productivity and grow our business. ", "Now, Bill will review the financial results. Bill? ", "Bill DeLaney", "Thanks Ken, and good morning everyone. As Rick and Ken have just discussed, our fourth quarter financial results were particularly strong. Our operating companies manage our businesses effectively, and the spike in food cost inflation contributed to the significant expansion in our operating profit margins as well. ", "Turning to our financial performance of fiscal 2007; sales surpassed $35 billion, pre-tax earnings grew 16% and diluted earnings per share increased by 18%. Sales grew 7.4% including the impact of EITF 04-13, which reduced our reported sales growth by 0.7%. ", "The operating leverage that accompanied our sales growth is encouraging, and these results are especially gratifying since we were rebounding from a challenging year in 2006. ", "Free cash flow defined as cash flow provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion, less capital expenditures of $603 million, approximated $800 million for the year, a significant improvement over the prior year. We expect our capital spending to range between $625 million and $650 million in the New Year. ", "Acquisition activity was modest in fiscal 2007. In addition, we returned nearly $1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. ", "I also want to provide some perspective on the earnings impact of several unrelated but significant items this past year. Specifically, the favorable impact of reduced pension expense and stock compensation expense, together with comparatively higher gains related to our company-owned life insurance, was largely offset by incremental incentive accruals and expenses incurred related to our strategic business initiatives. ", "Looking forward to 2008 and acknowledging that, with the exception of pension expense, these items cannot be projected with certainty. We now expect the aggregate impact of the change in these items to materially impact our fiscal 2008 financial results. ", "I'd also like to share some additional perspective on income tax expense for the year. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was comparable to the fourth quarter of '06. The overall annual rate declined from 39.35% in 2006 to 38.25% in 2007. This decrease is primarily attributed to a lower stock compensation expense and greater company-owned life insurance gains I mentioned a moment ago. While difficult to predict, we do not foresee a significant change in our tax rate for fiscal 2008. ", "In summary, we are pleased with our financial results. We understand that one quarter is not a trend maker. We've always focused on producing solid, sustainable operating results and will continue to do so. More recently, we've begun to develop processes and metrics in conjunction with our strategic initiatives. These tools will further sharpen our focus and enhance our ability to accomplish our long-term goals. ", "With that, Rick will share his closing remarks. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Thank you, Bill. As mentioned before we had a strong fourth quarter and fiscal year, with solid sales growth and exceptional expenses leverage. By the end of 2007 we moved strategy from the formative stage to the implementation stage. It was particularly gratifying to achieve a major milestone of $1 billion in net earnings for the first time in our company's history. I am optimistic as we begin fiscal 2008. I feel strongly that we have the right initiatives and people in place to executive these initiatives. ", "We got back on the growth record in fiscal 2007 and I believe we will continue to build on our momentum. We are beginning to see some of the benefits of our initiatives, but keep in mind it's early. We have a ways to go and the benefits will come over time. We are the largest player in the competitive industry. We continually invest backend of the business to allow us to maintain and grow our competitive advantages, which we expect will enable us to continue growing the business into the future. We hold the strong position in the industry and we are working on continually improving it. ", "Throughout Sysco's history, our growth has consistently outpaced that of the foodservice industry. We are encouraged with the progress of our business initiatives to date and remain confident that the successful execution of these initiatives will position us well to participate in the growth and success of our customers for years to come. Therefore, although the industry growth has moderated somewhat in recent years, we are targeting 7% to 9% annual nominal sales growth going forward. This target excludes the impact of major acquisitions, which to the extent they are completed will produce additional sales growth. ", "We expect to continue to improve our operating leverage, which should allow us to convert this sales growth into low-to mid-double digit annualized earnings growth. ", "Operator, we'll now take questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instruction) And we'll take our first question today from Jason Whitmer of Cleveland Research Company. ", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company", "Hi good morning, good quarter. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Good morning, thank you. ", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company", "Rick, can you help us with maybe a review of your 45 strategic initiatives -- you obviously referred to them multiple times, or maybe with where you\u2019re at within your own progress report, where you expect to be maybe within the next 12 months, 12 to 24 months? Maybe one of the most important leverage for your company going forward? Thanks ", "Rick Schnieders", "Yeah, thank you Jason. In regard, and I will ask my colleagues to help me here, but in regard to the major initiatives, we certainly are pleased with the progress we have made with the RDC. We are at full ramp to the North East and operations there are going very well. ", "The construction in Alachua, Florida is also going along very well. So, we are pleased with the RDC and two other important parts of the National supply chain. Our DPR -- the Demand, Planning, Replenishment system which is been rolled out independently RDC to other operating companies -- that's going well. ", "And we are particularly pleased with the third piece of the national supply chain and that's TMS, the Transportation Management System, which is now in place for all operating companies across the system. ", "The second major initiative would be sourcing, and sourcing is going along very well. We are completing the second tranche, we had our first small kind of pilot in sourcing that represented about six product categories and $300 million of spent. We are now in the second tranche and we are very pleased with the progress we are making there. Still lots of work to do, we are still adjusted at the very beginning in that process also. ", "Integrated delivery, really kind of code name for optimizing our warehouse and delivery operations Ken alluded in his comments to the effort to reduce our miles driven, and that took a lot of work, but is going very well in the initial stages. ", "And finally, I would mention our demand, the work we are doing in demand around the customer and understanding better what our customers needs are and making sure that we have the service offerings that match up to those needs. So those are the major initiatives Jason. ", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company", "And when you look specifically at your sales drivers, is there anything beyond the core business reviews and the customer contact reps, things that you could identify over the medium-term or over the long-term that you are looking to really try to drive our performance versus the industry that can be tangible for us to measure you on? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Well I think mostly it\u2019s more of the same -- so the business reviews, business development, making sure we are following through our nose, but every one of these initiatives that I just mentioned are directly designed to grow our sales. So I would say that all of them will contribute to sales growth in to the short terms and in to the longer term. Ken, do you want to add anything? ", "Ken Spitler", "No, I think that covers it, Rick. I think we are just beginning in the demand side to do some pricing work. It\u2019s in the very early stages, but we are very excited about it at this point. Not ready to talk about it yet, but in some tests. ", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company", "Good. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Husson of HSBC. ", "Mark Husson - HSBC", "Yeah. Good morning. I just wanted to know if you could be a little bit more granular on some of the costs that are sort of floating around. I think you mentioned pension costs, but also bonus accruals in the past, and in the fourth quarter last year you told us what the bonuses were and how that swung year-over-year. It also mentioned fuel costs year, and maybe you could just talk about trends there and also pension costs for the coming year? And finally depreciation which seems to be growing rather slowly, can you just talk about why? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Sure, and Mark, I will turn it over to Bill DeLaney to respond to your question. ", "Bill DeLaney", "Okay, Mark, let me break it down a little bit. I think as far as the fuel costs, we have higher fuel cost this year than last year. A good portion of that, but it's not overly significant, it\u2019s pretty much in line with our increases and some of that is pricing. We did buy in last year, which today we are pretty happy with that decision. We have a contract in place through the end of December. So our costs are up, but they are not up dramatically. There is little bit of mileage increase there as well, but overall we still imagine the fuel costs pretty low at this point. ", "What I am going to try to do is connect maybe the other, some of the other items that you mentioned here in two different ways. I mentioned in my comments that if you bundled these items, there are five major items that we\u2019ve spoken to at various points throughout the year. Pension Stock comp, the company-owned life insurance cash funds and value gains, and then offsetting that to some extent, those have been primarily favorable, and some of those have been fairly large favorable swings. ", "And we also brought our constituents or investors up to speed throughout the year in terms of the investments that we have made in both strategy initiatives and also acknowledge the fact that last year, in the year where the company didn\u2019t perform to its historical standards, we didn\u2019t pay out bonuses here in at the corporate offices. We\u2019ve got a big swing there, so what I was trying to put across there my comments -- suppose if you put all that and net it all out, and when I am saying you should have saved, but you were prone to do that they essentially offset for both quarter and for the year. ", "Now, in the third quarter we did give you a little selective guidance there because we were looking at a very large unfavorable swing on the bonus accrual side which was more than what it had been earlier in the first three quarters of the year. So I can tell you that the bonus accruals came in pretty much in the range that we discussed in the call last quarter and in the 10-Q. The one thing that came little more favorable than we would have been able to project, because you can\u2019t project these things was the -- obviously the stock market was very strong and that resulted in some favorable gains in our cash undervalue with the company in the life insurance. So, we've come through it all. We probably picked about a penny versus where we thought we would have been, when we were talking about a quarter ago. ", "Mark Husson - HSBC", "Penny for the quarter? ", "Bill DeLaney", "Penny for the quarter. Not over last year, but versus where our mindset was when we were talking to you at the end of the third quarter. ", "Mark Husson - HSBC", "Okay. Since you are going to sort of -- if this businesses was normal than fiscal '08 and also could you just talk about depreciation which only grew at 5%? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s really -- the major point we are trying to make here is that we expect going in to the New Year that the pension expenses really the only one I consider today, and tell you with any certainty and that that will be very modestly favorable, we believe in '08. ", "The stock comp, that'll vary somewhat; our options will be to the end of this year or later in the year, so we may have some quarterly fluctuation of a modest amount. But generally and not knowing what the market is going to do, we don\u2019t really attribute much of our outlook in terms of what's going to happen in those lines. ", "Certainly, we would expect even [Santa Claus] to be much closer in magnitude with '08 versus '07. And quite frankly on the strategy, as we operationalize more of it and put more if it in to our various corporate departments and we are really not in a position to track that, where we have in the past, and it\u2019s pretty much become more of our corporate overhead, as well as what we are trying to do operationally. ", "Depreciation Mark, I may have to do a little more work on that. We\u2019ll come back to you and talk about it in the K and at the Analyst Meeting, but we have spent aggressively over the last couple of years on several very good projects in the CapEx line and I think at this point we just haven't seen the acceleration that\u2019s come from that. I don\u2019t have any particular insights, Kirk do you have anything you want to add on deprecation? ", "Kirk Drummond", "No. I really don't. The only thing I could say is that we are making longer-term investments. That the assets are going to be longer-term, which would lower your depreciation. ", "Mark Husson - HSBC", "Yeah. Because some of the early spending on the RDC was software writing, which presumably was written off very aggressively, very early. ", "Kirk Drummond", "Yes. But then the others, a fair amount is buildings and then the buildings as we go forward with that facility expansion pulled out things like that. Those have got much longer lives. ", "Mark Husson - HSBC", "Thank you very much. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Thank you, Mark. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Meredith Adler of Lehman Brothers. ", "Sean Roberts - Lehman Brothers", "It\u2019s actually Sean Roberts for Meredith today. I am just looking at your real sales growth line over the past several quarters. How do you feel with that indexes versus the industry? And I guess what in particular gives you comfort that that can accelerate next year? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Well again I'll ask my colleagues to pitch in here, but in terms of real sales growth, when we look at what's going on in the industry today we feel comfortable that we continue to outpace the industry and take share from our competitors. So we are very comfortable with that. ", "The other thing that we have talked about for a number of quarters now, is sort of that illusory number of inflation and frankly it's one that moves around, it can move around very, very rapidly, so we are focusing on nominal, topline sales growth, ex-major acquisitions and just making sure that we leverage that nominal -- that top-line growth. ", "Kirk Drummond", "Yes. I think Sean the only other thing is that, as Ken pointed out in his comments, the inflation environment is a difficult environment to operate in when it gets to 6% and that's challenging for our customer as well as our operating company management team. So I think it's difficult to see the strong real sales growth when you have customers whose purchasing budgets are being impacted by your higher costs. We feel we are doing a pretty good job managing, so there is always going to be some interplay, as Rick points out, between your real growth and when you have higher inflation. ", "Rick Schnieders", "And then what Ken pointed out was the ability of those operating companies, which was absolutely terrific to be able to manage through that. I am sure we took some amount of hit on the gross profit line, but the opening companies did a terrific job managing their expenses beyond any positive impact we may have gotten from the higher inflation. So, we are seeing the operating companies leverage their business very effectively. They are going to continue to leverage their business, and I would expect most of that to come at the expense line. ", "Sean Roberts - Lehman Brothers", "Can you maybe describe that process of passing through the higher cost to customers, and how that might differ between independent versus the chain versus the institutional customers? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Sure, I mean half of our business roughly is a contract basis, half of it is independent side. And on the independent side of our business, we are just working with the customers on a daily basis, sort of negotiating on an item-by-item basis. And so it's a real-time activity that takes place. And so as new pricing, higher or lower comes into play, it takes some amount of time to get that price change into our customer base and into independent customer base. On the contract side of our business, it's pretty cut and dry. For most items, the non-commodity items, prices would change on a monthly basis. For commodity type items, those who are going to generate a bulk of the revenues and the bulk of the purchases, those change on a weekly basis. So, that's kind of on a [real high level], that's the way the mechanism works. ", "Sean Roberts - Lehman Brothers", "And they have full transparency into your cost on the contract business or\u2026? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Well, sure, because they know what their markets are as they are fee structure, so they see the cost, sure. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next questions from Steve Chick of J.P. Morgan. ", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan", "Hi, thanks. Good quarter. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Thank you. ", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan", "Bill, I don't know if you have this handy, but your prepaid expenses jumped a bit in this quarter. In fact, it looks like by most of what I've seen -- looking back in the past I think it doubled what it was in the third quarter. Do you happen to know why that is? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Yes, I do. We'll talk more about it in the K Steve, but we do have a litigation accrual out there that we are involved in a product liability claim that we believe we are very, very well insured for, but it's progressed to the point when we set up both in accrued expense and a prepaid for roughly the same amount, and that's the proper accounting. So basically, we've added close to about $50 million to the accrued expenses and $50 million to the prepaid, another line to account for that, but there is no P&L impact. ", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan", "Great, okay. Good. There is no cash impact, I guess. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Correct. This is totally non-cash, non-P&L at this point. ", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, great. And then to clarify, now I understand you want to get at the unusual -- the operating expense items or so forth. Did you say that the net favorable impact was a penny for all of the items or was that just for the quarter? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Okay. Let me be real clear on this. What we said is on the year-over-year that they largely offset if you look at all of the items. Going back to the third quarter when we gave some selective guidance on the bonuses, we did that because it was much larger now than it had been and to be honest with you, probably at that time if we were to have provided this, which we wouldn't and didn't, we probably would have thought that we would have a hard time for it to be breakeven in the fourth quarter. With the stock market being strong, it turned out that the cash surrender value came in much better than what we thought, which allowed it to basically offset for the fourth quarter. So, I don't mind the COLI gave us about a penny for the quarter. ", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Versus a year ago. ", "Kirk Drummond", "But Steve, the total of those major items did a balance off for the quarter. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Yeah, it is important as they are roughly offsetting for the quarter and for the year, it's just add -- if you go back 90 days. I don't know that we would have thought that we'd have offset. But again, we're only talking a penny. But since you're asking that's the situation. ", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, that's helpful. And then last, for the business reviews, did you say what you did complete for the year and down and how many you plan going into 2008? ", "Kirk Drummond", "No, we didn't. I haven't collected that data as of yet, but I'm sure it's in the 40,000 and we expect that to go slightly going to 2008. ", "Rick Schnieders", "I think one of the underlying things we've seen there Steve, is that this is, we've been doing this long enough now. That's truly become pretty much -- and accepted best business practices that's what we do and we'll continue to track them internally, but we're probably not going to talk quite as much about the aggregate numbers going forward. ", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, alright, thank you. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Thank you, Steve. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ajay Jain of UBS. ", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "Rick, I know you've got a policy of not commenting on the beyond going financial impacts from the RDC but with the second facility coming on stream this year. How do you feel about the year-over-year comparisons? Or the benefits that you're seeing now for the North East, RDC now have to offset the depreciation expense and pre-opening expense that you are going to expect to hit the P&L from the second distribution center in Florida? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Yeah, Ajay thank you, the real -- going back now for a year for four quarters because, we already see a stuff so now inter-twined with the business itself, the operating companies, we're not commenting partly because again it becomes very difficult as most of the benefits accrue at the operating companies. So, we don't comment on the specifics of the RDC itself. However, I'll just go back to what I did say earlier and that is that we are at, full ramp, the operation is running very, very smoothly, we are very pleased with it and we are going forward with the forward RDC at this point and it's on schedule, it's going very, very well. ", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "Okay. And can you also confirm what the increase was in headcount for marketing associates and customer contact personnel both for the quarter and for the year? ", "Kirk Drummond", "5% for the year. ", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "Okay. And for the quarter? ", "Rick Schnieders", "I don't think we know that number, we could get it, but it's a little early to collect all that data from the operating companies. But if it is 5% and it's probably a good number for next year. ", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "Okay, great, thank you very much. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Thank you, Ajay. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we'll go next to John Heinbockel of Goldman Sachs. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "A couple of things, for long-term goals what's the time table for that, is that five years or something different? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Well, I don't know, we've talked about specifics, but I would say it's three to five years but it kind of ongoing, we are thinking about it as ongoing, but yeah, three or five years. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "There will be the seven to nine normalize inflation is probably what around three? ", "Rick Schnieders", "We think in terms of two and half. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. You\u2019re sort of thinking 4% to 6% real growth on average over that time period? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Sure, however the numbers workout, but yeah, we were really focusing on that nominal, that topline nominal growth excluding major acquisitions. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "How would that -- does that tie in roughly to, I know we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, and how much of the strategic initiative savings get reinvested, and how much go to the bottom line? Does that sort of tie in to a 50:50 splitter or something different? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Well, we really haven't talked about those numbers, and I will tell you that I don\u2019t know that we know those numbers yet. There is still work to be done, but we are going to share some of those strategically, share some of those savings strategically to help our customers grow our business, grow particular categories and some will come to the bottom line. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Alright, and on gross for the quarter, you know, I thought the number was very good considering inflation and also the drop in corporate brand penetration? Are you seeing now a fairly, I don\u2019t know, if you have a number, but from the strategic sourcing initiative, does that now ramping up -- in dollar terms at a fairly good rate. Was it much better than the third quarter ramping up at that level or not quite? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Well I think it is ramping up, John. We don\u2019t have any numbers at this point in terms of the overall impact, but the first spend, the first pilot project, six categories was $300 million, the second tranche is about $1.3 billion. We are doing some initial work on the third tranche, and so, again, if we add the $300 million and the $1.3 billion you are still at a fairly small number versus in comparison to the total purchases. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "But you guys, do have a -- can you track every quarter the amounts you are saving on sourcing, a dollar amount? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Okay, we can do, we track it. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and it sort of increasing pretty consistently on a sequential basis or are we seeing some do we see a jump in the fourth versus the third or not really? ", "Rick Schnieders", "No, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t want to get into that level of detail, John and leave the extraordinary. I think that, frankly at this point we don't know and the numbers we really don\u2019t want to get into. ", "Bill DeLaney", "John, this is Bill, I mean, as Ken mentioned, these hundreds of metrics we look at, many of those are along these lines and it\u2019s very detailed and they move around and it\u2019s a process as we\u2019ve described from the beginning. So it\u2019s not quite as scientific as something I want it to be. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Alright, and then finally, I guess, it sounds like you are not in demand for your customers, we are not seeing any real weakening there in light of what's happening with inflation and the economy in general, that\u2019s held up pretty well? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Yeah, I think the demand is at most customer type. It is very, very level and we don\u2019t see a significant change at this point. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Thank you, John. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Alex Patterson of RPM. ", "Alex Patterson - RPM", "Yes, thank you. Just following up on John's questions about the nominal sales target implicit about a 5% to 6% real growth rate, is that comfort level sort of inflation ignorance, I mean, in other words are you really expecting real growth to re-accelerate to that, or do you really need to get inflation down to the 2% to 3% level to attain that? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Well, again our target is for nominal which would include the inflation and the real sales growth, and as we've said several times over the past year or two is that, because of all the things that move within those numbers, we are really focusing less on inflation at this point and looking at the nominal sales growth, because ultimately that's what we have to leverage to grow those earnings. ", "Bill DeLaney", "I think again it's important to impress upon everyone and I think John just asked his question. These are goals that we've targeted for ourselves over the longer-term whether you say three to five years as Rick pointed out. So one of the things we are trying not to do is to get into a quarterly component of each delta here. Because they move around we've gone back and as I'm sure you all having look at the growth in the industry over the last several years and we looked what Sysco has done in those environments. And based on industry history and in our performance in different environments, we thought that this would be a more realistic goal to set over the next three to four years. ", "Alex Patterson - RPM", "I mean I asked you because really the metric is more important than the nominal sales number as your gross profit dollar growth, as the vehicle to leveraging your operating expense and hitting your bottom-line targets. So I guess what I\u2019m wondering is, are these nominal sales growth targets, really sort of getting towards a gross profit dollars growth target, in sort of a backhanded way? ", "Bill DeLaney", "I don't think so and I think that the thing that we learn every year and every day in this business is, if there is gross profit, there is expense and we believe that these are realistic growth goals for us to manage the business around. For example, if you take a look at this quarter, if we just look at it kind of line-by-line we would say, well our margins were up but our expenses were unusually low versus the prior year. ", "So, which is the most relevant? Well, I think the most relevant is in an inflationary environment, our operating margins improved by about four times of the point, and even that's a little bit more than what we would ask you to expect going forward, but I don't know that I would necessarily agree that the gross profit is the defining line. I think the way we are looking at it, as you got sales line, then you've got operating margin line, and when you get to that operating margin line, we expect to expand that over time to leverage those earnings, and a lot of things that are into this product mix, customer mix, and then these types of environment that we are working in today. ", "Rick Schnieders", "But we do expect most of their gain as we've suggested previously. Most of the gain will come at the expense line and we are working hard to make sure that we are -- our systems are in place to drive our expense ratios down. ", "Alex Patterson - RPM", "Yes, okay. Well okay. Thanks. The shipping and handling for the year was that up or less than the rate of sales? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Yes. ", "Ken Spitler", "Yes. ", "Bill DeLaney", "Yes. But in comparison it absolutely was. ", "Alex Patterson - RPM", "Okay, great, thank you. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Andrew Wolf of BB&T. ", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Good morning, congratulations on a nice quarter. And obviously in the quarter for everything you are saying in the numbers, how they flushed out to the bottom-line, you manage in the quarter nicely against inflation and obviously in the systems and everything like that. But Rick, I mean, let me just speak out what my view of the world is and I would like you to answer that, if this inflation stays high it's just can't be anything but tougher for your customers, and vice versa. ", "I mean if [Gerry] stops inflating 20% and comes back down, that will be good and if it stays up at 20%, I just don\u2019t frankly see how it helps them. Either their bottom-line gets contracted or they try to pass it through and restaurant prices go up. Could you just sort of -- I mean you folks have a view internally on how you're looking forward -- your sort of, what's sweet spot for inflation and as what investors should think about in that regard? ", "Rick Schnieders", "I think a sweet spot for inflation is roughly that 2% to 2.5% number, that is kind of the traditional number. We operate better in that environment. We think that our customers do also. But I will tell you Andy that we work very, very hard with our customers to help them manage through this difficult time. So things like -- we will help them do pricing on their menus to make sure they are staying up with the cost that they are experiencing, that they are putting that into their menu costing. We help them find alternative products to introduce to their patrons, is either a special item or on their menus. ", "We have fairly sophisticated menu printing and reprinting services that we provide for our customers also. And so I think the other things is, when you start talking about the industry as a whole, it's kind of like averages and it becomes very difficult. We have many, many operators who are terrific in managing in these difficult times. They up their promotional spending. They draw customers into their restaurant. They manage their menu appropriately and they manage their menu pricing appropriately. So, I think there is a core of customers, they are here today and will be here in ten years who will go through these more difficult times and be very, very successful going through them. So, what we can help is that we just help those customers, help our customers in these more difficult times. ", "Ken Spitler", "But as I said, Andy, this is Ken. As I said in my opening comments, we don't think that level of inflation is good for our customers or us. We would like to see it less than that six down in the 2, 2.5 to 3. ", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thanks. And Rick just last to follow-on, because the way you spoke about, obviously certain operators being much more adept, is there -- could you, averages sort of being if not misleading less than FIFO. Is there any, would you classify or draw any distinctions you have how independent operators, let's say stronger independent operators, which Sysco was I think very well penetrated with, versus your typical chain. Do you think a strong independent had this, is that what you are talking about the independents have? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Yeah, in general, because they have greater flexibility, they can move more quickly than chains can. But frankly chains are pretty good at moving pricing also. So, there are various student management teams in those major chains. But the independents are certainly more fleeted foot, they have got one operation or two operations or five operations and they can kind of adjust to the circumstances that present themselves. ", "Ken Spitler", "We find that the independents are able to move from product to product a lot easier in terms of menuing. So, I think that's an advantage for them. They can roll it out pretty quickly. ", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Rick Lodewick of Searock Capital. ", "Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital", "Hi, how are you? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Fine, good morning. ", "Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital", "I just had a couple of quick housekeeping questions. With respect to the tax situation with the government, do you guys have any update on that? ", "Bill DeLaney", "Rick, Bill here. No, we are still in the fairly early stages of the appeal process. We have written our protest, respond to their letter and we have written ours and we are going to work through this thing and probably we will take the better part of the year before we have some type of stronger conclusion on what is going to play out. But we feel very good with our position as we said all along. ", "Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital", "Perfect. And just a quick question. If you disclose or can you disclose the allowance for bad debt that was associated with other receivables. Is that change meaningfully as the percentage of the receivables year-over-year? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Sure, our bad debt numbers this year were very close to last year. We set a record last year, it's a very small percentage of our revenues. ", "Ken Spitler", "We had a good year in terms of what we call right also in this year and now we'll have more detail for you and that in the filings. ", "Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital", "Okay. When is the filing expected to come out? ", "Ken Spitler", "I think it's the 29th of August. ", "Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital", "29th August, okay. And you guys have changed the accounting for the COLI last year and now it's starting to cooperate through it sort of creating this volatile income stream or unpredictable income stream that I think the change was intended to avoid, I mean, if you have any thoughts to going back to the old method of accounting here or what are your thoughts on that? ", "Ken Spitler", "Yeah, I have been thinking about two weeks, the answer is given in this call. And also this is \u2013 Rick, the thing is that we misinterpreted an accounting proclamation when we changed to beginning of fiscal 2007. We thought we could go to the cost method which frankly will be a lot easier and we'd make it simpler for you to understand as well. ", "And it turned out we misunderstood that, so then at the end of the third quarter we went back and restated the impact was not material for the year. It's not even material for the quarter but to your point again, it does create a little bit of volatility more of your attempt than anything else I think as far as of our communication. ", "So, it's not a big deal which is something smaller scale like pension expenses. So something is going to be volatile and in this case it's going to -- one thing, I think, I can tell you is when you see the equity markets performed well, we should do -- we should get a little bit of benefit and when they don't perform well, we will get hurt a little bit and but the accounting we are using today is the appropriate accounting. ", "Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital", "Thanks. ", "Ken Spitler", "And the only accounting we can use. ", "Rick Lodewick - Searock Capital", "Right, I think I got it. Thank you. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Operator, we will take two more questions, okay. ", "Operator", "Thank you Sir. We will go next to Mark Husson of HSBC. ", "Mark Husson - HSBC. ", "Yeah, a bit of follow-up here just one on the general competitive environment. U.S. Foodservice kind of -- just to catch your attention -- has disappeared into the more of some interested private equity people but the EBITDA interest coverage is not much better than one. What do you think that goes to a competitive environment and what is it look like right now, do you see anything upfront? ", "Kirk Drummond", "Well, we have seen much changed it all, a lot of rumors flying around but no real change. ", "Mark Husson - HSBC. ", "I guess the second question would be, if we are right and the low EBIT margin is something to do if they have some large chunks upon profitable business and is there any conversations happening that you can talk about, about you might like some of those businesses or no? ", "Kirk Drummond", "We like all their business, but no there are no conversations going on which we can share with you. ", "Mark Husson - HSBC. ", "Okay. I like that last bit. And then, final question is, you had mentioned, I think, in the last analyst meeting that as food retailers are increasingly selling good food and prepared food, there may be some opportunities in that market and maybe also in an Asian cuisine and things like that, would you think look at to try and boost your growth rate or are there some other up-markets out there that you are starting to work with? ", "Rick Schnieders", "I think that's a big one, Mark. The other one that we continually work with, it's a smaller segment. Certainly today it\u2019s this meal assembly business, which is best characterized perhaps by the company Dream Dinners, I don't see [a analog], which is a really good operation and a great customer of ours where consumers can go in and prepare meals for the next two weeks or month or whatever at very reasonable prices, good menus, good ingredients. ", "So, I think that\u2019s one small sort of trend out there that\u2019s an opportunity for us that we are taking advantage of. But frankly we need to do a better job with the retailer, so I think have gotten better with take-out food and more aggressive with take-out food. We are focusing more heavily into that market. ", "Mark Husson - HSBC", "Okay. Great. Thank you. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our final question today from Westcott Rochette of Bear Stearns. ", "Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns", "Thank you very much. Just a question on kind of where you see the inflation environment right now, kind of how we peaked and kind of what your outlook or built in to your outlook, say over the next 6 to 12 months? ", "Rick Schnieders", "Westcott, I would tell you that we are not smart enough to figure out what's going on in the inflation area over the next even few months. As you know, there is a lot of pressure certainly in the corn markets. There was the largest corn crop in history, I believe, plan of this year, but it\u2019s a really difficult thing to predict. So I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll ask Larry maybe, Larry Pulliam was with us this morning. Larry can give us some updates in regard to what he is seeing in the product categories himself. ", "Larry Pulliam", "Yeah, Rick I would have to agree with you, your assessment on it. Westcott, we track commodity cost in just about every category from all the grains, very last top, fuel packaging and we measure it on ongoing basis. We measure it on year-over-year, and clearly and now you have seen some of these things as well, this last quarter it was just unbelievable. Corn prices, grain, soybean and we really don\u2019t have a good feel of where it\u2019s going to go. ", "We track it very closely, we monitor it, we see the impact it has on our food products, and as Ken said, we have the capability of having the penetration with our territory sweet customers and MA sub customers, so we can help them to move to certain other products, but we ask, we don't know where it is going to go. We have no idea or don't have a good feeling that it's going to be less in the near future. ", "Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns", "Thanks. And then\u2026. ", "Ken Spitler", "And it seems to be a lot of different things at play, political, some droughts, the field situation. It's a little more complex than I think we\u2019ve faced before, but we are prepared for it and we are prepared the leverage whatever comes at us. ", "Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns", "And just, in general, I know you guys talked about how different customers are dealing with the inflation. Are you seeing in working with your customers generally increasing product menu in order to deal with it or just kind of absorbing it for the near-term and kind of piecing of where we are in that cycle? ", "Kirk Drummond", "I mean I guess this wouldn't be just a temporary price increase by all accounts. Inflation is kind of on a relatively higher sustained level. So, can you just comment? ", "Rick Schnieders", "We want to work with our customers on a regular basis because these kinds of changes, as we have suggested here this morning, can happen often. They can be pretty volatile, they can go high very quickly. They can go -- the pricing can go lower very quickly. ", "So what's important for us with those 8,000 sales people that are on the streets is making sure that they have the ability to communicate with those customers, and when they see changes in particular product category, that they help their customers make the appropriate price changes on their menus. It\u2019s the only way they are going to survive. So it's part of the way we work. ", "Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thank you very much guys. ", "Rick Schnieders", "Thank you. And I would like to thank everybody who has been on the call with us this morning. We feel very, very good about the quarter, as you probably heard in the comments today, and we feel very, very good about 2008 and beyond. So again, thank you for your interest, thank you for participating in the call today, and have a good day. ", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference call.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like toturn the call over to Mr. Rick Schnieders, SYSCO's Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rick Schnieders", " Thank you, operatorand good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss SYSCO's firstquarter fiscal 2008 financial results. With me in Houstonand speaking on today's call are Ken Spitler, President and Chief OperatingOfficer; and Bill Delaney, Chief Financial Officer.", "But first, let me turn it over to our newly appointedAssistant Vice President of Investor Relations, Neil Russell.", "Neil Russell", " Thanks Rick, and goodmorning everyone. Before we being, please note that statements made in thecourse of this presentation that state the company's or management'sintentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future areforward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results could differ in a materialmanner.", "Additional information concerning factors that could causeactual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-lookingstatements is contained in the company's SEC filings, including, but notlimited to risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-Kfor the year ended June 30, 2007 and in the company's press release issuedearlier this morning.", "I want to point out a couple of changes to our reporting.The income statement and the press release include a couple of additional lineitems. First, we added a line item to show gross margin dollars. Second, weadded a line item to show operating income. Although both measure can becalculated from our previous reports, we decided to formally shown the lineitems going forward. Please understand that all comparisons given during thecall refer to changes between the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and the firstquarter of fiscal 2007, unless otherwise noted. Also, all comments about earningsper share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "With that out of the way, I will turn it back over to ourChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Schnieders.", "Rick Schnieders", " Thank you, Neil. Letme start by saying we had another solid quarter, delivering sales growth of8.5%, and leveraging that into 16.2% earnings per share growth. We areencouraged by the fact that this is the fourth consecutive quarter whereearnings per share growth has exceeded 15%.", "We are pleased with how the new fiscal year has begun. Wecontinue to take share in a difficult business environment, with high inflationcontinuing throughout the second quarter. We are executing our strategicbusiness initiatives, and we are gaining traction from these initiatives acrossour operations. As we have communicated in the past, our initiatives are long termin nature, and take time to fully implement. ", "A key component of our strategy is to invest in our future,to find better and more efficient ways to serve our customers and driveprofitable growth. We are always trying to help our customers grow, whichpositions us to participate in their success.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Ken, who will talkabout how our operations performed in the first quarter.", "Ken Spitler", "Thanks, Rick. Overall I am pleased with our performance inthe quarter. Sales growth was in line with our expectations, and operatingincome increased by about 16%. Our operating companies performed well. Similarto last quarter, our internal measure of product cost inflation remained higherthan normal, averaging just under 6%. Our operating companies continued tomanage their business very well in that challenging environment. Our ability togrow gross profit dollars faster than operating expenses was key to ourresults.", "Something I said last quarter still holds true: while ouroperating companies performed well under the current conditions, we believe amodest inflationary environment over time is best for SYSCO and our customers.We experienced low gross margins as a percent of sales this quarter, which isnot unusual during times of high inflation and inversely, inflation favorablyimpacted operating expenses as a percent of sales. This combined with effectivecost management by our operating companies helped drive our growth in operatingincome.", "Last quarter I shared a few metrics that helped drive thebusiness. This quarter, I will expand on one of those topics: miles driven. Weare continually managing the miles driven in order to provide quality serviceto our customers and to minimize fuel expense. As a result of increasinglyimpactful initiatives such as XY routing and designated delivery days, thenumber of miles driven increased only about 1% in the quarter. ", "In summary, I am pleased with our operating results, and weare committed to continuous improvement going forward. Now Bill will review thefinancial results.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you, Ken. As Rick and Ken have just discussed, ourfirst quarter financial results were strong. Earnings per share grewapproximately 16% in the quarter, primarily driven by sales growth of 8.5%, andoperating margin expansion of 31 basis points. Gross margin dollars grew 7.3%,while operating expenses increased only 4.7%. ", "These results include a $16 million decrease in share-basedcompensation year over year. We moved the grant date for incentive stockoptions from the first quarter to the second quarter of the fiscal year, and weexpect the benefit created by this timing change to be partially reversedduring the second quarter.", "The first quarter results however, were negatively impactedby a $9.4 million charge for an anticipated accelerated future contribution toone of the company's multi-employer pension plans. ", "Cash flow from operations increased about $19 million, orapproximately 11% in the first quarter to $192 million, primarily driven by ourgrowth in net earnings. As we noted in the press release, capital expenditureswere $132 million during the first quarter, which is in line with our businessplan. Such investment even in challenging times is necessary if we are toachieve our long-term goals.", "My last point of discussion will be the income tax rate. Theeffective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was 38.1%, a decreaseof about 60 basis points from the same time last year. The decrease in theeffective tax rate was primarily due to the net tax benefit resulting from thecombination of two items. ", "We recorded a tax benefit for a net operating losscarryforward related to state taxes, which was partially offset by a taxprovision for a foreign tax contingency. The net impact of these two items wasa net benefit of about $5 million, which reduced the overall effective taxrate. While difficult to predict, we do not foresee this favorable variancecontinuing over the balance of the year. ", "In summary, we are pleased with our financial results forthe quarter, and encouraged by our overall performance for the past year. Weremain focused both on contributing to the ongoing success for our customers,and achieving SYSCO's long term financial objectives.", "With that operator, we will now take questions.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "Operator", "", "Your first question comes from John Heinbockel - GoldmanSachs.", "John Heinbockel  - Goldman Sachs", "Rick, can you talk about the macro environment a little bit?Are you seeing any real tangible sign of a purchasing slowdown by yourcustomers? Or is that happening and you are simply picking up enough share tooffset that?", "Secondly, do you see your customers consolidating vendors orsuppliers at a faster rate here than they were six months ago or a year ago?", "Rick Schnieders", " Thanks for thequestion, John and in fact, I think it is fair to say while not having terrificindustry numbers, we don't see a lot of growth out there. However to your pointexactly, we are watching the pieces, the new items that we are sellingcustomers out there, and we feel very good about that. ", "To the second part of your question about consolidation, itis pretty hard for us to determine whether there is any consolidation, otherthan whether they are using fewer distributors; other than the fact that we aregaining share in this challenging marketplace.", "John Heinbockel  - Goldman Sachs", " How much is drop sizegrowing roughly, this quarter or last quarter? Do you have a sense of that?", "Rick Schnieders", " Yes, average dropsize, those numbers we have shared before are running about where they havebeen the last three years, which is in the range of 3% to 4% in the averagedrop size.", "John Heinbockel  - Goldman Sachs", " That has been fairlyconsistent. There hasn't been a pickup or a slowdown really of late, say thelast couple quarters?", "Rick Schnieders", " No, and as Kenalluded to last quarter and this quarter, we continue to work with ourcustomers to get those additional items, but also to make sure that we arerouting our trucks properly, getting the right number of cases on the truck andwhere we can, to do some consolidation to get our average pieces up. That is franklyworking very well.", "John Heinbockel  - Goldman Sachs", "Finally, the gross margin impact from inflation looked to bea little lighter this quarter versus last. Is that more a timing of passthroughof your costs? Is it more that? Or is the centralized procurement benefitpicking up sequentially?", "Rick Schnieders", " John, we haven't doneany sort of statistical analysis on that difference. I think the difference isnot significant, the difference between the impact of inflation on grossmargins last quarter and this quarter. We are still, as Ken alluded to in hiscomments, we are still pressure on gross margins related to the inflation. Onthe other hand, we are picking that up at the expense line, but even more thanthat, I think an indication of those operating companies and how hard they areworking to control their costs, we are seeing the real pickup at the expenseline, which is exactly where we expected and where we have to see it.", "John Heinbockel  - Goldman Sachs", " The procurementbenefits are picking up gradually, correct? There hasn't been any big step-upof late?", "Rick Schnieders", " That is right.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ajay Jain - UBS.", "Ajay Jain  - UBS", "I think there have been a couple of instances, I think itwas last year and also in fiscal '06 as well where you had some calendar shiftsfor accruals related to pension expense, and I was just wondering if you couldtalk about what the basis is for these timing adjustments on your actuarialassumptions?", "Bill DeLaney", " The change we aretalking about this morning is on our stock comp expense, not on the pension. Inthe past, I believe the issues on pension have been more or less annually,year-over-year, and a lot of that is driven by the discount rate that we arerequired to use to discount back the projected benefit obligations. The changewe are talking about today is on stock comp. ", "That was a conscious decision. We didn't put it all in therelease because it is kind of cumbersome. The long and the short of it is it isprimarily for administrative reasons, it just was becoming increasinglydifficult to process the options, get them in front of our comp committee, andfind a time that we could issue them outside of a black-out period, that wouldwork for everyone. In the interest of being more accurate and optimizing thetime window, we pushed the grant date back from September to November.", "In fact, we will be going to the comp committee with ourrecommendations this week, and there will be a final meeting next week, andthose grants will be approved as deemed by the committee next week. So that isreally all it is. It is more of administrative change. As I have said here, wewould expect a good portion at least of that benefit to reverse in the secondquarter.", "Ajay Jain  - UBS", " As relates to thestock compensation, you did mention that some of that, based on the change inthe grant date, that benefit will reverse itself this quarter. Can you give anymore specificity and quantify how you see the comparisons in Q2, and also whatyour outlook is on an annualized basis for options expense for the full year?", "Bill DeLaney", " It is one of thosegreat questions that you would need to be a soothsayer to give you a preciseanswer. We haven't even gotten them approved yet. It is dependent on how manyare approved and the mix of the people that are involved in that package and alot of other things. So I think as far as I will go with you today is we wouldexpect a portion of it to partially reverse in the second quarter, and I thinkwe'd be in a better position by the end of the second quarter, perhaps when werelease earnings, to give you a little better view going forward. ", "But I will tell you this, in the Q as we're drafting ittoday, we don't really expect this year-over-year change to be material.", "Ajay Jain  - UBS", "I seem to recall last year that the share repurchaseactivity was a little bit front end loaded. I was just wondering if you couldconfirm what the level of share buybacks were in the latest quarter?", "Bill DeLaney", "It was back end loaded I believe last year. It is just thereverse this year. We picked it up quite a bit, and Kirk is sitting right here.Do you have a number, Kirk?", "Kirk Drummond", " Actually, we evenedit out a little bit for the first quarter. I want to say it is about 187million, I think, in the first quarter.", "Bill DeLaney", " So we have beenpretty aggressive buying back this quarter.", "Ajay Jain  - UBS", "Can you confirm the number?", "Bill DeLaney", " It is roughly 190million this quarter, versus about 65 million for the first quarter last year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Meredith Adler with LehmanBrothers.", "Meredith Adler  - Lehman Brothers", " I would like to goback a little bit to just Ajay's question about pension, because I didn'treally understand what was in the press release about something about potentialacceleration. What exactly have you done, and what do you anticipate needing todo?", "Bill DeLaney", "As we have disclosed, I think pretty consistently, weparticipate in several different multi-employer pension plans, which areessentially plans that our union employees are participants in and wecontribute to those plans. We have one such plan that in fact, in the past wedisclosed that there is some underfunding issues in the aggregate; not in eachof those plans but in the aggregate.", "One of those plans, we have become more aware of in recenttimes, and in particular in the last month, that their underfunding situationis much more acute. In fact, even though we haven't been directly notified, wehave reason to believe through third parties that we will probably need to makean accelerated contribution here at some point in the relatively near future.So with that information, we went ahead with the best information available tous, and took a charge for about $10 million.", "Meredith Adler  - Lehman Brothers", "I would like to go back a little bit to the first set ofquestions about the macro environment. If you look at the public restaurantchains, they are clearly suffering tremendously.

We are beginning to see just recently alittle bit of softening in some categories; dairy, for instance which reallyneeded to soften up. I am sure you have followed that Argentinahas been out of the wheat market here for the last ten months or so, and onFriday they announced they were coming back into the market. Wheat prices atcommodity level are down just a bit month over month.

Again, very anecdotally,we do get positive feedback from our customers, and I have got some storiesthat I could tell, and I am sure most of the folks in this room have stories,where we have had a particularly strong relationship with a customer, we havehelped them enormously and their business has grown.", "So you know, absolutely, I think that is happening outthere. We have operating companies where we have done a number of businessreviews with the same customer and at some point, the only way we are going tocontinue to grow with that customer is to help them grow their business.

What are some of the best wins andchanges coming out of that over the six weeks or so?", "Ken Spitler", " Yes. That was just areset meeting to make sure that we were doing the best we could. Some of thelearnings that we had out of that were how we rolled it out to the operatingcompanies. We were a little slow getting that out to them, so we have refined thatprocess, and we are quicker to market with the rollout. That was probably themost significant learning that we had out of it. There was a lot of just thatsort of thing that we did.", " Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research", "Last question, Rick, there was a chart a couple years ago, Iremember seeing it very frequently, in terms of the number of operatingcompanies that had an operating margin above 6%, above 7%, something to thateffect. I think if I recall, almost two-thirds of them were above 6%. Has thatchanged materially over the last couple years, into something like sourcing orRDC, or whatever else you have in your strategic road map does that change theearnings power potential of any of the operating companies?", "Rick Schnieders", " Well, I think itdoes, Jason, but maybe even more important that that is it is all those thingstogether, but it's also just the ability of that management team or thosemanagement teams that were not at 7%, that were at 2% or 3%, their ability overtime to kind of get their arms around the business, and manage the net marginsof the business upwards. I think it has changed, but as you will also recall, Iam sure, is that those operating companies that were toward the lower end ofthat graph generally tended to be the newer operating companies, because theywere acquisitioned.

It just takes time toget your arms around all the moving parts to drive your earnings higher. Thatchart in terms of the shape of it would not be significantly different.

We don't have any real statistics on that.

On the otherhand, we today continue to work the largest list of smaller acquisitions thatwe have ever had an opportunity to work. I think as in anything, there areopportunities, there will be opportunities at the larger end, the largeracquisitions. I think that the multiples will get more realistic over time.

You want to look at itright down to the case level Mark, and so absolutely, and the RDCs allow us tokeep the trucks fuller.

So there is a huge benefit there,particularly longer term, as we move more and more inbound freight throughthose RDCs. It is a big environmental positive environmental impact, and a bigimpact in terms of the cost.", "The other thing that is happening that we feel very goodabout is that we are shipping more product by rail into the RDCs than weanticipated.

When you open that back door,it is stacked to the ceiling.", "Mark Husson  - HSBC", " To push it a littlebit further, if you had some catastrophe in Venezuelaor something and you had to deal with $5 a gallon and you are having a meetingright now, what would be top of the agenda to discuss?", "Rick Schnieders", " I think we would haveto look at expanding fuel surcharges for sure. But the other thing, silverlining in this whole thing, is that we are closer to our customers than ourcompetitors. We do do a better job of routing those inbound trucks, so we areall going to pay essentially the same price for fuel. We just do a better jobon a per case basis on moving that product.", "Ken Spitler", " I can add to that bysaying that on the outbound side, we would be looking at reducing miles, andreducing the number of deliveries that we currently make. If you are getting three,then we would go two, if you are getting two, we would go one, that sort ofthing. It is all about miles.", "Rick Schnieders", " And in ourdiscussions so far, because we have been in a fairly high fuel environment herefor a while, our discussions with our customers as we have gone to betterrouting has been quite positive.

Is it fair to saythat the rate of inflation, the second derivative here is decelerating, anddoes that allow you to capture more passthrough?", "Rick Schnieders", " I think if it is kindof a delta question, yes, I certainly think that we have seen a slowing in therate of inflation. In fact, if you look at the just numbers quarter to quarter,a slight decline in inflation. So going back to our earlier conversation, wemight see, based on early information about wheat, dairy, cheese particularly,we might see a softening of that inflation number.

That is a good question and that is a fair answer, obviously, but I thinkyou have got to balance, a very, very slight maybe slowing in deceleration twoquarters in a row for our customers, where their costs are up substantially.

The reason you have that kind of volatility or one of thereasons from quarter to quarter, in terms of when the grant date is designatedis because of the makeup of the folks who get the options. The way theaccounting works, I am going to keep this pretty high level, but to the extentthat you've got folks that are toward the end of their tenure, and they arevested in our retirement plans and able to retire, the way the accountingventure works, is you have to expense the full amount of value of those optionsfor those folks who tend to be some of your higher paid people, at the timethat the grant is given.

I wouldn't use any lower than that. We will keep youposted. This was kind of a one-time benefit here or net benefit as we talkedabout that the accounting requires you to take that benefit in the quarter, andthen it becomes realized.

However to Bill's point, sometimes thereare those psychological hurdles. Initially they say they want to sell, and thenlater on they think twice about it and change their mind.", "Right now we have got a very active list. Honestly most ofthose are relatively small. But it is good consolidation, a lot of them will befold-ins, those are particularly profitable to us. We fold them into anexisting facility. So it is a good pipeline out there right now. But they tendto be the smaller opportunities.", "Bill DeLaney", " The only thing Iwould add to that is just that what has been going on in these financialmarkets, I think we are getting more calls from the smaller businesses thatmight be looking to sell. I think that is somewhat predictable with theuncertainty in the markets. That tends to be somewhat of a reality check forfolks.", "The larger people, I think they have to go back to thedrawing board and strategically look at their businesses, and what they want todo. We wouldn't expect to be seeing a whole lot right there now, and we arenot.", "Rick Schnieders", " As we suggestedearlier, two things like government regulation and high fuel prices can be particularlychallenging for somebody that is in a small segment of the business. They run alot of miles. They don't have a broad base of product to put on those trucks.So this is a challenging environment, as you know, and I think that causes someof these folks to think about monetizing what they have built over the years.", "Meredith Adler  - Lehman Brothers", " I have one morequestion. Have you noticed any marked difference in the business by geography?", "Ken Spitler", " The Midwestis a little bit softer right now.", "", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Steve Chick \u2013 JP Morgan.", " Steve Chick - JP Morgan", "You mentioned a large customer win, I think, within thequarter. Did that start off at the beginning of the quarter, and is that acustomer that you won from U.S. Foodservice?", "Ken Spitler", " It started actuallyin the fourth quarter, Steve. It has ramped up all the way in the first quarterhere. It came from a variety of sources. The business was spread out.", " Steve Chick - JP Morgan", "Obviously when your Q gets filed, we end up seeing a littlemore of the profits by segment. I don't know if we have to wait until then orBill, can you speak to maybe where the profits were? You had a pretty goodlevel of margin expansion this quarter, in operating margin. Once we get the Q,do you have what the corporate overhead pieces might be, just broadly? Wherethe margin expansion came from by segment, or do we have to wait until thefiling?", "Bill DeLaney", " We are going to fileon Thursday. We have spoken to a lot the corporate benefit in terms of thestock comp, and you'll see there is a modest benefit from COLI and pension, andthat type of thing. There is some good benefit there and then there is modestleverage at the operating line.", "Operator", " That does conclude today'squestion-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. RickSchnieders for closing remarks.", "Rick Schnieders", " I want to thankeverybody for participating in the call today, and I also want to thank you foryour continuing interest in SYSCO.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neal Russell, Assistant Vice President of Investor Relations.  Please go ahead, sir.", "Neal Russell", "Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining us for Sysco\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2008 conference call.  On today\u2019s call you will hear from Rick Schnieders, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ken Spitler, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bill DeLaney, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "With that out of the way, I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Schnieders.", "Richard J. Schnieders", "Thank you, Neal.  Overall I\u2019m once again pleased with our results. Growing sales by nearly 8% and earnings per share by approximately 10% in the second quarter.  Notwithstanding the challenging economic conditions we continue to gain market share by helping our customers achieve their business objectives and improve our profitability b y leveraging our sales growth.  We are executing well and re-investing in our business.  Challenging times have always provided opportunities for Sysco to further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace because our customers increasingly look to us for support and business solutions.  As the industry leader, we have an unsurpassed ability to leverage our size and scale to benefit our customers.  Over the past few years we\u2019ve continued to stratify our customer base resulting in quality relationships with superior customers.", "The diversification and quality of our customers allow Sysco to participate in a full range of business by limiting exposure to any given segment.  Specifically, one-third of our business comes from outside the restaurant industry, such as hospitals, nursing homes, and schools, that are not directly core related to discretionary consumer spending.  ", "For the past several months, our industry has experienced various macroeconomic pressures such as high inflation and fuel costs that restrict growth; however, we have dedicated associates focused on helping our customers succeed which we expect will continue to benefit us over the long term.  Sysco continues to grow faster than the industry and our pursuit of productivity gains should allow us to mitigate the impact of some of these pressures over time.", "Now I\u2019ll turn things over to Ken so he can explain how we execute this plan and how we performed in the second quarter.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Thanks, Rick.  Our performance in the second quarter met our expectations as sales grew nearly 8% and as Rick stated continued to outpace industry growth, demonstrating our ability to gain market share.  In addition, we were able to grow earnings per share about 10% in the quarter.  Inflation as measured by our internal measure of product cost inflation remained high, averaging about 5.9 for the quarter.  Inflation from dairy products had the largest impact, with the balance spread across several categories.  Although we don\u2019t forecast inflation, we anticipate product costs to remain high over the balance of the fiscal year.  Our operating companies manage their business well with gross profit dollars growing faster than expenses excluding the impact of two items that Bill will discuss later.", "Business reviews in hiring additional customer contact personnel continue to be very effective in allowing us to help our customers manage their business.  Business reviews, for example, can help our customers succeed in a market that isn\u2019t growing by, among other things, exposing them to Sysco\u2019s broad range of product and service offerings.  As part of the review, we typically identify opportunities for the customer to improve their profitability which strengthens our relationship further.  Business reviews also allow us to attract new business and importantly avoid lost sales.  ", "As we said before, conducting quality business reviews is embedded in how we go to market.  Regarding cost management, we made additional progress during the quarter in rolling out productivity-enhancing initiatives that contribute to increased profitability as they become fully implemented.  In certain instances such as designated delivery days and XY routing initiatives which are designed to reduce miles driven, improved productivity helps offset external cost pressures that we cannot control such as higher fuel prices.  ", "While we are making good progress on managing miles driven, fuel expenses will unfavorably impact our financial results over the balance of the year.  We estimate fuel costs will negatively impact year-over-year earnings by approximately $0.03 to $0.04 in the final two quarters of physical 2008.  Our estimate is based upon both current spot prices for diesel and the cost of a forward contract we recently entered into for about 35% to 40% of our total fuel needs through June.  Fuel expense was about $0.01 in the first half of the physical year compared to the prior year.  As we\u2019ve benefited from a forward purchase expired in December.", "In summary, we had another solid quarter from an operational and financial standpoint.  I\u2019d like to thank the entire Sysco team for their leadership and hard work.", "Now Bill will review the financial results.  ", "William J. DeLaney, III", "Thanks, Ken.  As Rick and Ken just said, we had a solid second quarter.  There are a few items regarding our second quarter financial results, however, that merit further clarification and which I would like to discuss.  First, from our improved governance, and as we communicated last quarter, we moved to [grant eight] for incentive stock options to the second quarter this year, resulting in approximately $5.6 million of incremental expense in the second quarter.  Second, operating expenses for the quarter include an unfavorable year-over-year comparison of $11.9 million related to our investments and company-owned life insurance.  The underlying value of these policies will continue to be impacted by any volatility in our financial markets.  ", "For the first half of fiscal 2008, sales grew 8%, operating income leveraged nearly 3 points to 11%, and earnings per share grew 13%.  These results reflect our ability to grow gross profit dollars faster than operating expenses.  Our financial results do include some significant fluctuations in both the first and second quarter on certain expense items including share-based compensation, company-owned life insurance, and multi-employer pension plans; however, these fluctuations in the aggregate offset any year to date basis.  The key point that I\u2019d like to make here is that our solid growth and profitability is primarily a result of disciplined execution at our operating companies.  As we begin the second half of fiscal 2008m, we are focused on continuing to increase our market share and improving productivity throughout the company by executing best business practices and carrying our strategic business initiatives.  Prevailing economic and market conditions require such focus if we are to achieve our business objectives.  ", "In summary, we are pleased with our overall performance for the first half of fiscal 2008.  Looking forward we see significant opportunities both to grow our share of market and improve productivity.  While we do not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead, we have tremendous talent throughout Sysco and we are committed to achieving our business objectives.  ", "With that, the Operator will now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", " ", "Today\u2019s question and answer session is held electronically.  (Operator Instructions) We will go first to Steve Chick at J.P. Morgan.", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan ", "I guess a couple questions.  Rick, I was wondering if you could comment on how sales trended during the quarter.  It looks like it slowed a little from last quarter.  That might have been in the Sigma segment more than anything else.  If you could, given the environment, I was hoping you could comment on kind of what you\u2019ve seen post quarter end now that you have a month or so under your belt.", "Richard J. Schnieders", "Sure thing, Steve.  In fact, we saw pretty even results in the quarter.  If there was anything that impacted the quarter, and this is not to whine, but we did have some weather-related impact in the second quarter.  We had broad snow and storms across Oklahoma and the Midwest and the Northeast so I think that\u2019s probably, if there was any slight degradation in the rate of sales growth, it was mostly related to that.  I will tell you that for the first three weeks of the year that we\u2019ve seen, the first three weeks of the calendar year, the first three weeks of the third quarter, that we\u2019ve seen very similar sales trends.  We don\u2019t see any reason to suspect that the sales rates will get slower so right now it is important to remember that March makes our quarter but on a comparison basis January and February are our slowest two months of the year but again on a comparative basis, we feel pretty good about what we see right now.  ", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "Steve, this is Bill, just to confirm what you alluded there, the broad line sales growth was pretty much the same both in the first and second quarter.  ", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan ", "Great. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful commentary.  Second, I was wondering if you could comment on the landscape a little bit, I guess in terms of competition and maybe specifically what you\u2019re seeing out of US food service.  I think the last call you had mentioned some activity in Cincinnati and closing of maybe one of their operating companies there.  Any updates on what you\u2019re seeing out of them?", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "Steve, this is Ken.  We\u2019ve had some rumors of some two more closings.  Right at this moment I can\u2019t remember which ones they were but as far as activity, the same report as last time, really no change.  ", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan ", "Okay and separately, in your announcement of Rick, a new board member addition I think within the last month or so, you had some specific language mentioned about your focus on international opportunities and how that would help and it seems to me like you guys progressively get just a little more open minded about expanding internationally and I was actually wondering if you could just speak to that a little bit.", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "We\u2019ve never been accused of being open-minded herein the food business here, Steve, but we\u2019re definitely kind of exploring the landscape outside the US and Canada.  We feel good about the opportunities, particularly in certain parts of the globe, the growth opportunities, and we think that that\u2019s long term a huge opportunity for us.  Having said that, we, as we have in the past, would be very cautious and move with care but we are definitely exploring the landscape out there as you said.  We\u2019re pleased to have Dr. Koerber on the board, I\u2019ve known him for about 10 years.  He\u2019s a terrific executive and will provide a level of strategic insights that will be beneficial to the entire board and to Sysco.", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan ", "Okay, thanks and just last, Ken, the $0.03 to $0.04 of additional fuel costs in the second half, are we okay in thinking about that kind of evenly in the third quarter and the fourth?", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "Yes.  ", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan ", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to John Heinbockel with Goldman Sachs.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs ", "Rick, a couple of things.  Business reviews, what type of lift are you getting in this environment compared to maybe a year ago or 18months ago?  Same kind of lift, better, worse? Where do we stand with that?  ", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "I think it\u2019s about the same.  I mean, it continues to drive lots of sales growth for us.  The relationships we build with the customers that go through business reviews is superb. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, one of the ancillary benefits although important benefits is that our [churn] of those customers that have gone through a business review is very, very low, so it\u2019s a relationship building opportunity for us.  So we continue to do more and more of them. The operating companies are very committed to business reviews.  Many operating companies today have two kitchens, two businesses, so there\u2019s a real commitment on the part of our operating companies and it is producing significant results for us.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs ", "Secondly, bring us up to date on centralized procurement, where we are in terms of items, categories, dollars, and how that\u2019ll play out as we head towards fiscal \u201909?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "I don\u2019t know that we have any projections in fiscal \u201909 but right now in terms of our categories and the dollars that we have targeted, we are right on track to have that done by the end of fiscal \u201908 and then moving into \u201909, but we don\u2019t have the next phase 3 or 4.  I don\u2019t know what the specific numbers are but we\u2019re on track, John.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs ", "What\u2019s the timing for phase 3?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "This fiscal year.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs ", "The next phase then.  Is that a fiscal \u201909 initiative?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "Sure.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs ", "And are we seeing in your gross margin numbers today, we are seeing a very clear benefit from centralized procurement that\u2019s offsetting inflation or we\u2019re not seeing that much yet?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "Again with our business, there\u2019s so many moving parts that it\u2019s very difficult to determine where it\u2019s showing up and I guess that I for one at least am comfortable that it\u2019s helping mitigate some of the impacts of inflation, but to draw one on one bead on it, to say that this particular item has helped us this much would be very difficult to do, John.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs ", "Okay.  Then finally, is there any update on the IRS situation or that\u2019s just kind of out there, likely to be resolved later this year?", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "John, we\u2019re still in that early phase I guess you\u2019d call it of the appeals process.  We do have some meetings coming up later in the quarter and I think probably the next time we\u2019ll talk on this call we\u2019ll have a better handle on the timeline but I still think we\u2019re looking at about a 12 month period minimum to resolve this.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs ", "12 months from now?", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "Give or take.  Yeah, I think we will have a little better information next time we talk.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs ", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "We will go next to Greg Badishkanian at Citigroup.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup ", "Great, thank you.  First question is when you look at your real sales growth and overall sales growth, how do you think that compares to the industry and you mentioned that January seemed to be kind of consistent with the last quarter that you just reported so why do you think you\u2019re able to kind of have pretty steady decent type of real sales growth in what seems like a pretty tough macro environment?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "I think it is a tough macro environment, Greg, and the broader numbers that we look at for instance, I think you nailed it, we look at [Net Trac] and we see a pretty challenging environment at least in those public casual chains, so we use that as a proxy for the industry. We feel good about our ability to outgrow the industry.  We\u2019re continuing to take share from our competition.  So again without being exuberant about our enthusiasm or being too enthusiastic we feel good about the direction we\u2019re headed and our ability to take business and I\u2019ll let Ken kind of pick up on that.", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "We kind of manage our sales growth in a particular way that we\u2019ve put in place about 4 years ago and that is that we try to gain a certain percentage of new sales and we do that by every year growing our sales force which we have by argument\u2019s sake I guess twice the size of our next biggest competitor and we manage lost sales and penetration and we do both of those through our business review, business development process where we control the amount of business that we lose on an annual basis and we continue to grow and measure that growth in our customers.  So years back we put in this sales management concept that we think is paying off for us today in a very tough environment and will continue to pay off for us as we go forward.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup ", "Do you feel that you\u2019re getting greater penetration with your customers or would it be that your customers look at the last quarter or two are just taking share versus their respective competitors?", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "By measurement we\u2019re gaining in penetration.  We measure each and every one of our customers so we know we\u2019re gaining.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup ", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We go next to Ajay Jain at UBS.", "Ajay Jain - UBS Securities LLC ", "I just had one quick question for Bill DeLaney on operating expenses.  For stock compensation I know that you had some calendar shifts based on the change on the grant date from Q1 to the second quarter but it seems like for the first half of the year overall the comparisons on options expense were still pretty favorable by about $11 million if I\u2019m not mistaken so I\u2019m just wondering how do you see the outlook for stock compensation in the back half of the year now that the comparisons seem to be a little more normalized?  Is that something you feel like you have enough visibility on right now?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "Yeah, Ajay, I think we do.  I think the point I was trying to make in my comments on the first half of the year is that you can see there on the funds flow statement that the stock comp is favorable as you pointed out by about $11 million I guess it is.  There were other things offsetting that though, so when you look at our first 26 week numbers and you put aside some of the gains on property sales last year and the [call weed] thing this year which was favorable the first quarter a little bit unfavorable the second and then the stock comp bounced back and forth, if you just clear the deck with all that, pretty much the 26 weeks I think is a really good barometer for where we\u2019re at.  Now with that said, as we look at the second half of the year, the stock comp should be modestly favorable probably in the ballpark of what we saw the first half of the year.  There\u2019s still things that could impact that but that would be my best judgment right now and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts as you can appreciate that can impact earnings a penny here or a penny there but that particular line we would expect that to be modest.", "Ajay Jain - UBS Securities LLC ", "Okay, so the $10 million to $11 million for the first half that should be broadly representative?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "Yes.", "Ajay Jain - UBS Securities LLC ", "Okay.  Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Meredith Adler at Lehman Brothers.  ", "Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers ", "Hey guys.  Couple of questions.  It sounds like you\u2019re beginning to be very active in managing your fuel costs but do you see any change in the outlook for having your customers pay you surcharges?  Obviously some do already but is that becoming more common?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "I think it is becoming more common and we are certainly reviewing all of our options in terms of reflecting what\u2019s going on in the fuel market today so fuel surcharges, we want to make sure we\u2019re up to date on those, making sure we route those trucks more effectively than we ever have and we\u2019re the operating companies are doing a terrific job in terms of getting more efficient at routing the trucks and putting more pieces on so we will absolutely continue to pursue all opportunities and options to mitigate that fuel cost.", "Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers ", "Okay and then could you talk a little bit about what you see happening with your customers with this very high food inflation?  Are you seeing significant changes in their behavior?  Are you hearing anecdotally the traffic is down because the cost of a meal has gone up a lot?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "I think we\u2019re hearing that it\u2019s soft out there.  It\u2019s very hard to translate anecdotal information.  Again, one of the strongest proxies we get is the [Net Trac] we think is one of the strongest proxies so we use that as kind of a guide in terms of how well we\u2019re doing versus the marketplace, but yes, there\u2019s no question it\u2019s a challenging environment out there and we feel very good about our performance in the second quarter and we feel good about our opportunity to continue to execute on business reviews and the other initiatives we\u2019ve got out there and to achieve our midterm and longer term goals.", "Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers ", "Then I have a final question for Bill DeLaney.  You mentioned multi-employer pension liabilities as being volatile in the first half.  Could you just talk about what it did in the second quarter and also the first quarter?", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "It really wasn\u2019t a factor in the second quarter.  We had a small gain last year and the plan wasn\u2019t that material that we\u2019re going against it but the bigger point I was trying to make, Meredith, is in the first quarter we had an unfavorable impact that we took a charge for a situation with one of our plans and I think it was about $9.5 million so basically it was more of a first quarter impact on the unfavorable side and slightly favorable second quarter so it\u2019s just one of those line items that we\u2019ve talked about here and there, but my point I really want to leave you with today is we\u2019ll keep you posted on that, we\u2019ll speak to it as it\u2019s appropriate in the Q but when you put it all together for 26 weeks, that stuff all pretty much washes out.", "Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers ", "I assume it\u2019s very difficult from what I know about multi-employer pension liabilities, it\u2019s very difficult to forecast where they\u2019re going to go.", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "It is.  We have several of them and some are in better shape than others in terms of funding so I can tell you we\u2019re very acutely aware of where they are and we\u2019re working through those as best we can.  The bigger challenge is it\u2019s very difficult as the participating employer a lot of the time to have much of an impact on decisions that get made in terms of how those plans are administered so it\u2019s something that we have to deal with and we\u2019re very focused on it.", "Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers ", "And I just have one final question back to Rick.  I\u2019ve been trying to understand what kind of behavior a restaurant would have as they see their sales flowing.  Would it be fair to say that there would be a lag between the time that they would start to see traffic slow and when they would purchase less, because clearly they don\u2019t want to be \u201cout of stock\u201d in any sort of important item that\u2019s on their menu.  Have you seen that with customers?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "Meredith, it would be a very short lag time. Their inventories are very slim.  If you look down the supply chain, the greatest inventories are at the suppliers and that at the distributor level at Sysco and then finally at the customer end.  It\u2019s very short inventories, just a few days, so anything that happens in that restaurant is going to happen very, very quickly versus what\u2019s going on in terms of their business itself, the patrons that they have coming through the door.  ", "Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers ", "Okay, so if they\u2019re seeing a slow down --", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "Meredith, we see them make immediate adjustments to their inventory almost on a daily basis so any lag you would see immediately.", "Meredith Adler - Lehman Brothers ", "Okay.  That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next to Westcott Rochette at Bear Stearns.", "Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns ", "Thanks a lot guys.  If I could just have a moment to kind of talk about the balance sheet landscape for a lot of the independents in terms of how you manage your receivables as if we move into more of an economic slow down, whether you see an increase in restaurants running into some difficulties paying their bills, how you balance that extending credit versus not and just maybe reference back to maybe \u201901 is not the best time frame but maybe even going back to \u201990 or\u201991, how the pick up in potential bankruptcies or closings might have adjusted and how you managed through that.", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "I will start Westcott and I guess the one comment I would make is kind of going back to the script and that is where we talked about the quality of our customer base today having improved over the years partly because of the way we segment them and stratify them and some of the difficult decisions we made in regard to not-so-profitable customers several years ago so we feel good about the quality of customers that we have as an organization and I guess the other thing that makes me feel good and I\u2019m sure the rest of us here is that we have 8,000 or 9,000 marketing associates on the street every day sort of managing those restaurants and helping them with our receivables, helping them in helping us, and making sure that we keep those customers as current as possible so at this point in time I don\u2019t think we would raise a red flag about deteriorating conditions or deteriorating pay rates.", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "It\u2019s very hard for us to tell in January as you typically see a little bit of slowing of payment but it\u2019s been significant and I think your real question is how do we manage it if they start paying slower and we have very stringent credit policies that we maintain in almost any environment. It\u2019s very difficult to make up once you write off a customer of that profit and so in a low margin business you have to be very tough on credit.  We don\u2019t sell credit, never have sold credit, never going to sell credit.  ", "Westcott Rochette - Bear Stearns ", "All right, thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "We will go next to Andrew Wolf at BB&T.", "Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets ", "Thanks.  Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the fuel question. Those numbers you gave first for the first half $0.01 and the expectation for the second half, those are gross, right, before any ability to pass it through?", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "Yes, that\u2019s our fuel expense number, Andy.", "Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets ", "And I know Meredith asked this but let me just parse it a little bit.  What percent of the contracts or what percent of that is sort of contractually you can pass through with a bit of a lag?", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "With the customers that we have agreements with, I would say 90% of them have some sort of agreement written in that we can pass on some fuel charge based on generally speaking a sliding scale of diesel price.  We have no agreements on the street side.  Not every one of our CMU customers have that agreement so I hope that answers your question.  ", "Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets ", "It\u2019s pretty close, better than it was.  I wanted to ask you first of all in the quarter was there any help from acquisitions or have you anniversaried any acquisitions that would have evaded the top line?  It was like 0.2% last quarter.", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "I think it\u2019s similar this quarter, even less, 0.1 maybe, I think.  It\u2019s about $30 million I think.", "Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets ", "Okay, so fairly de minimus and lastly on the acquisition environment, Performance Food Group before they decided to sell had said that the environment from an acquirer\u2019s point of view had gotten a little easier and that expectations were down and more people might be interested.  Do you have any comment in that regard?", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "I guess they were right.", "Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets ", "I think they were talking about the rest of the... Although maybe that\u2019s what they were talking about.  Assuming they were talking about the rest of the universe of potential acquirees, that\u2019s what I\u2019m... ", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "I think there\u2019s going to be some adjustment in terms of people\u2019s thinking regarding the multiples. Some of the multiples we sell even in our industry, you might say were a cause of the ultimate consulting problems that we\u2019ve quit in terms of the credit market, et cetera, so anybody\u2019s guess, but I think the expectations are going to be lower in the future.", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "Andy, what we see a lot of the smaller family businesses that are looking to exit the business and those are what we typically fold into our bigger operating companies.  So generally speaking their expectations have been lowered recently.", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "I think Andy the only thing I would add is that with all that said, as you can appreciate, in some of these larger deals, what\u2019s happened with the private equity market is it\u2019s harder to get financing for any large deals for financial sponsor type of transactions so that\u2019s the other dynamic that\u2019s out there right now.  ", "Andrew Wolf - BB & T Capital Markets ", "Okay.  Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Jason Whitmer at Cleveland Research Company.  ", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company ", "Hi, good morning.  Rick, are you seeing any change to the competitive sets specifically surrounding pricing or anybody trying to chase some business in this environment considering how much softer the market demand is?", "It kind of goes back to what Ken said earlier when the question was asked about our largest competitor and we really don\u2019t although as we\u2019ve said in the past, we see some erratic behavior on the part of some customers in certain markets, kind of an irrational pricing if you will.  It\u2019s not across the board, and that hasn\u2019t changed.  We still see a little of that here and there but broadly speaking we\u2019re not seeing any change in pricing practices by our competitors.  ", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company ", "And Ken is the second RDC on schedule and any kind of progress report on how you\u2019d expect that to ramp versus the first one?", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "It\u2019s on schedule for shifting or ramping up in April.  We anticipate the ramp to go much faster this time because we have 90 coming and so all\u2019s well at this point.", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company ", "Will there be a visible impact though on the P&L?  Obviously there was a material impact the last go round.  Will it be modest at best this time?  Will it be incremental on the cost on the ramp?", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "I think it would be incrementally modest.  There\u2019s a ramp up and we\u2019ve kind of tried to allude to this, it\u2019s hard to project because we don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019re going to start shipping there, but I would think there will be a little bit of a negative impact if you will.", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "At the very end of our fiscal year.", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "In our fourth quarter, yes.", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company ", "Ken, can you provide any context to transportation savings overall?  I think you mentioned routing and designated delivery days.  When you throw in the RDC into that all the other components you\u2019ve got working on it on the back end, can you just provide some color as to how quickly that\u2019s moving or maybe just some relative perspective versus last year versus two years ago because obviously you\u2019re seeing some good success there?", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "Our miles are down this year although our sales are up so that\u2019s a positive impact of really all the things that we\u2019re doing.  They all kind of go together and it\u2019s an ongoing process.  I think we characterize it as a routing initiative as if we could do it once and we\u2019re done. Actually it means that we\u2019re kind of viewing our transportation network in a different way today and that is every week, every day we\u2019re looking at reducing those miles to say that we\u2019re going to be able to mitigate the cost of diesel as it is. I don\u2019t think that is probably feasible, but we are attacking it as best we can and trying to mitigate those expenses again and what we have control over and it\u2019s working very well for us.", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company ", "And lastly Rick I wanted to come back to an acquisition question.  Is there a way you can look at not just broad line businesses but other ways to grow the broad line business because I\u2019ve seen in the past it\u2019s largely just been pure acquisition of these businesses, but any tools you can acquire, I think a couple yeas ago you\u2019d actually mentioned that there are other core competencies that Sysco has that you could use to build upon that could actually also be market [inaudible].  Any thoughts on that?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "Yeah, without being specific we would still stand by that.  We think that there are, I\u2019ll use this term roughly, but adjacencies that make sense for us, taking advantage of the competencies we\u2019ve built over the years so absolutely it is in the scope of the options we\u2019re looking at.", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company ", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Chris Ruth at Piper Jaffray.  ", "Chris Ruth - Piper Jaffray ", "Hi, good morning.  When we look at market share gain opportunities, the opportunities you\u2019ve been talking about, on the balance of the year do you see greater opportunity in chains or independent business absent any major acquisitions?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "I don\u2019t mean to be wishy-washy but it depends.  Obviously the larger customers, the larger chain customers come in on a lumpy way and the independents on the other hand, they\u2019re kind of coming in, they\u2019re very small businesses, they\u2019re incrementally very small, so this year we\u2019ve had nice business, nice chain growth, but our street sales continue to growth very evenly too, so it\u2019s a hard question to answer but again keep in mind that when we bring in a big customer, it\u2019s a lot of business right now an the independent business just comes in gradually over a period of time.", "Chris Ruth - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay and then finally I would assume you have some food inflation assumptions built into your sales outlook on the year.  I know it\u2019s hard to forecast but do you at least contemplate or normalize inflation rate of 2% to 3% or something closer to recent levels of 5% to 6%?  Can you provide any color on that?", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "Not really.  I think it would be premature to think that inflation is going to come down to historic levels.  I think we\u2019re going to continue to be a little higher than the 2% to 3% that you referenced and again it moves all the time.  If we get bad weather in California, the produce markets spike very, very quickly.  Dairy prices can change on a dime so it \u2018s one of those unknown factors so again going back to almost everything that we\u2019ve said, what we have to make sure of is that we have any operating companies and at the corporate office the ability to move quickly when things change on us, whether it\u2019s fuel prices, inflation on food, or whatever, and that\u2019s really our goal, to be able to respond quickly and appropriately when the market changes.", "Chris Ruth - Piper Jaffray ", "Okay, very good.  Thanks.  ", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "I think I\u2019ll just add there quickly, I think everyone knows this, we are getting close to wrapping around some of the beginnings of these high inflation numbers as we get deeper in the third quarter, so as Ken pointed out and Rick now, we would expect it to still be relatively high but there may be a mass aspect to this and at some point it would start to subside.  ", "", "Operator", "We will go next to Bob Cummins at Shields and Company.", "Bob Cummins - Shields and Company", "Thank you.  Actually my question was basically on acquisitions and you talked about that a good deal.  I guess I won\u2019t try to follow up further.  But anyway, appreciate the call.  ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "We will go next to Alec Patterson at RCM.", "Alec Patterson - RCM", "I just wanted to confirm the guidance you\u2019ve given on the options outlook because I thought on the end of the first quarter call you described the change in the program where it would also impact the back half of the year, seeing an increase in options expense and now I think in response to Ajay\u2019s question you suggested it actually be down quite a bit.", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "Let me start and if I\u2019m not answering, straighten me out here.  I think what we said on the last call was we\u2019d be in a better position by now to give you a flavor for the second half of the year and so to put this in some type of context, the first quarter was favorable I think to the tune of $215 million or $216 million primarily because of the timing business.  This quarter was unfavorable $5 million t o $6 million primarily a timing difference so it\u2019s been favorable to about $10 million or $11 million and my best judgment sitting here today is that we would see another favorable variance the second half of the year for about $10 million.  Again, it could be off, different things effect this as we go through the cycle, but I would expect for the year it would be favorable.", "Alec Patterson - RCM", "So then for the year roughly speaking around $20 million favorable.", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "Correct.", "Alec Patterson - RCM", "Okay.  I just want to get that clear.  On the inflation that you\u2019re passing through a similar rate as the first quarter though if you look at some of the PPI numbers for the food industry you see what seems to have been a step up, especially with the most recent numbers, and certainly things haven\u2019t gotten any better across a variety of food commodities, so I\u2019m just wondering to what degree do you discern an incremental benefit from the procurement program against the inflation head wind?  Are we seeing incremental like you\u2019re shaving a point off of that right now versus maybe half a point before?  I\u2019m using numbers but just trend wise is what I\u2019m trying to get at.", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "I\u2019m going to back to our answer earlier Alec and say that it\u2019s very, very difficult to determine what that number might be.  We\u2019re encouraged by our progress.  I think the number now is somewhere around the end of the year we\u2019ll be purchasing $3 billion but even that $3 billion purchasing centrally is not going to move that number significantly and then our ability to measure it frankly is very difficult because of all of the other moving parts but overall I\u2019d just again say that we\u2019re on track in terms of goals that we\u2019ve set and we feel good about it.", "Alec Patterson - RCM", "Maybe a different way of asking that is at least at this point given the levels of inflation and what seems to be accelerating inflation in the industry, are you finding the procurement providing you with a competitive weapon at this point or is it still too de minimus to make a difference on the overall [cogs] outlook for your company versus competition?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "I think it\u2019s too de minimus at this point.  Anecdotally I\u2019d say that I think we feel pretty good about it but the numbers are still too small and there are so many moving parts to it that it\u2019s difficult to determine the actual impact.", "Alec Patterson - RCM", "Fair enough on that and then just lastly, what sort of experience are you guys having with credit, the availability of it, finding working capital if need be, et cetera?  I know you\u2019ve got a nice free cash flow story but just generally speaking to the degree you need it?", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "Again we touched on this earlier.  Obviously when you get in times like this there\u2019s a sanity check that we all go through both the operating company and here in corporate so we\u2019re going through and looking at our larger customers and as the earlier --", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "I think he\u2019s asking about our borrowing --", "Alec Patterson - RCM", "Your ability as a highly rated --", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "Our ability to borrow?", "Alec Patterson - RCM", "Yes.", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "It\u2019s probably never been better, I think.  I mean right now the financial markets are very favorable for high quality borrowers of corporate debt so we\u2019re looking at that and obviously [spreads of light] but treasuries will come down quite a bit so interest rates are pretty favorable right now long term.", "Alec Patterson - RCM", "Are you looking at refinancing potentially?", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "We\u2019re looking at it.  We\u2019re always looking at it.  ", "Alec Patterson - RCM", "You may be taking on more debt potentially?", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "That\u2019s something that we talked about before obviously and we certainly have the capacity to do it.  We just want to make sure as we do it that our priorities are straight in terms of what are opportunities are, whether they be more transactional or share repurchase, that type of thing.  So we\u2019re still evaluation that part of it.", "Alec Patterson - RCM", "Okay, understood.  Thank you.  ", "Operator", "We will go next to Steve Chick at J.P. Morgan", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan ", "Hi, thanks.  Just a follow up.  I was wondering what the increase in customer contact personnel was in the quarter and if you\u2019re still on track for a 4% rate of growth for the year?", "Richard J. Schnieders ", "Steve, actually we\u2019re at 4.5% through the first two quarters and I think we\u2019ll stay steady and around 4%.", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan ", "Okay and then second, I guess for Bill, maybe I missed it, but your other income was up a little bit year-over-year for the quarter.  I don\u2019t think that has to do with [coaling] or anything.  It looks like about $8.3 million versus $3.3 million a year ago?", "", "William J. DeLaney, III ", "Yeah, [coaling] you\u2019re right is in the operating expenses.  The bulk of that is the sale of a, I guess I\u2019d describe it as a little technology investment that we had that they restructure their business and we took that opportunity to sell our interest in it so that gave us a gain of I think about $3.5 million and that\u2019s one of the things, Steve, I was alluding to earlier.  Some of these aren\u2019t big enough to really get into specific disclosure, but in the first quarter we were going against the game from the prior year on a land sale.  That was unfavorable.  This one\u2019s favorable so again a 26 week, most of it washes out which is nice.  ", "Steve Chick - J.P. Morgan ", "Okay, so $3.5 million.", "Richard J.

Thank you for joining us for SYSCO\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2008 conference call.

", "Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and the third quarter of fiscal 2007 unless otherwise noted.  Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.  With that out of the way, I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Schnieders.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Thanks Neal.  Earlier this morning SYSCO announced sales growth of 6.7% for the third quarter and earnings per share growth of 14.3%.  These results represent our seventh quarter in a row of double digit earnings per share growth.  Considering the challenging economic environment, I\u2019m once again pleased with our results, particularly with our ability to continue to leverage our sales growth and to improve earnings per share.  The financial results this quarter reflect the ability of our Broadline companies to leverage effectively in a difficult sales and operating environment.  ", "Our continued success is the result of our commitment to satisfying the needs of our customers.  I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank all of my fellow SYSCO colleagues for their ongoing support of our customer\u2019s success.  Without question, the current operating environment is challenging for SYSCO and our customers.  But I\u2019m pleased to report that SYSCO is responding well to those challenges as our results published this morning demonstrate.  ", "We are executing at a high level as we continue to invest in our business.  SYSCO is not only the leader in our industry today, but we believe our continued investment in people, fleet, facilities and technology positions us to build upon our leadership for years to come.  The third quarter is one in which we normally experience some seasonality as March represents a disproportionate amount of sales and profits for the quarter.  ", "This year on a comparable basis, March was not as strong due in part to the early Easter holiday which created some headwind as people departed their winter or spring holidays and returned home earlier than in the prior year.  Additionally, difficult weather in the Northeast and Midwest provided a significant operating challenge during the quarter.  Ken will elaborate on more specific regional data in his comments.  ", "Difficult economic times have always provided opportunities for SYSCO to further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace because our customers increasingly look to us for support and business solutions.  As the industry leader, we have a unique ability and responsibility to leverage our size and scale to benefit our customers.  Furthermore, we\u2019ve continued to stratify our customer base over the past few years resulting in quality relationships with superior customers.  ", "Our business covers the full spectrum of food service facilities, from independent white table cloth establishments to quick service restaurants and everything in between.  We continue to see the benefits of having a diversified geography and a diversified customer base as well as a wide breadth of products.  For the past several months our industry has experienced various macroeconomic pressures, such as high food inflation and fuel costs that continue to restrict growth.  ", "However, our more than 50,000 dedicated associates are focused on helping our customers success which we are confident will contribute to our long term success.  Looking forward, our key long term goals continue to be: first, 7-9% long term sales growth.  Second, lever that up to low to mid teens EPS growth.  And third, maintaining strong return on equity and return on capital ratios over the long term.  Now I\u2019ll turn things over to Ken so he can review in further detail our operational results for the quarter.", "Ken Spitler", "", "Thanks Rick.  Our performance in the third quarter met our expectations and our sales growth of 6.7 continued to outpace industry growth.  More importantly, once again we demonstrated our ability to leverage, in particular, at the Broadline companies, resulting in our earnings per share growth of 14.3%.  The ability of our Broadline companies, our core business, to manage expenses and expand operating margins in this environment reflects the talent and work ethic of SYSCO associates across our network.  ", "One of the ways in which we are managing expenses is through productivity improvement.  An example of improved productivity is that on average, our trucks carry at least 15% more cases per load than they did in 2001.  Food inflation as measured by our internal measure of product cost inflation remained high, averaging about 6.2% for the quarter.  The product categories of dairy, canned and dry goods have had the largest impact for this quarter.  The balance of inflation costs were spread across several categories.  ", "Although we don\u2019t forecast inflation, we anticipate product costs to remain high for the foreseeable future.  However, as evidenced in our financial results, we are doing a good job of managing these product cost increases.  Our operating companies manage their business well, with gross profit dollars growing faster than expenses, in spite of the impact of certain items that Bill will discuss later.  Additionally, we continue to manage margins effectively in a high inflationary environment.  ", "On a regional basis, sales growth during the third quarter was strong in the Southwest, which was offset by a relative weakness in Florida.  The slower growth was a result of the early Easter holiday and the impact of a more concentrated housing crisis in that region.  Business reviews and hiring additional customer contact personnel continued to be very effective in allowing us to help customers improve their business.  ", "We continue to see benefits from customers who go through a business review and as we said before, conducting quality business reviews is imbedded in how we go to market.  Regarding our cost management, we made additional progress during the quarter in ruling out our productivity enhancing initiatives that should further contribute to increased profitability as they become fully implemented.

We continue to make good progress on managing miles driven, fuel expenses will unfavorably impact our financial results for next quarter.  ", "Fuel expense was about $12 million higher in the third quarter compared to the prior year.  We expect fuel costs will negatively impact year over year earnings by approximately $20-$25 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Now Bill will review our financial results for the third quarter and year to date.", "Bill DeLaney", "", "Thank you Ken.  As Rick and Ken just said, we had a good third quarter and I\u2019m pleased with our year to date results as well.

For the nine month period, sales grew 7.7%, operating income grew 10.2% and earnings per share grew 13.5%.

Our solid growth and profitability was primarily the result of disciplined execution at our operating companies.  There are a few items regarding our third quarter financial results that I would like to briefly discuss.  First, operating expenses for the quarter include a negative year over year comparison of approximately $18 million related to our investments in company owned life insurance.  ", "The underlying value of these policies will continue to be impacted by any volatility in the financial markets.  Additionally, we have favorable comparisons related to stock based compensation of $4 million and pension expense of $2 million that helped to offset some of the shortfall from the life insurance policies.  For the quarter, these items resulted in a net $12 million unfavorable comparison.  ", "During the quarter we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes, using the proceeds to pay down commercial paper.  The bond offering was successfully executed with attractive pricing that demonstrated the investment community\u2019s confidence in our financial structure.  This transaction allowed us to secure historically low long term interest rates on these bonds which comprised 35-40% of our long term debt.  Capital expenditures totaled approximately $400 million for the first three quarters of our fiscal year, slightly below plan.  ", "As a result, we have lowered our fiscal year 2008 capital expenditure estimate to a range of $550 million to $575 million.  Our return on average total capital, return on total capital, calculated as net earnings divided by average equity plus long term debt continues to be strong.  For the rolling 12 months ended March 31, our return was approximately 20%.  We believe that this was an important financial measure and we will provide regular updates in the future.

In summary, we are pleased with our overall performance for the third quarter and for the first nine months of fiscal 2008.  Looking forward, we see significant opportunities both to grow our share of market and improve productivity in all areas of our business.

So I mean are we sort of in a period here where things are going to get better for a while and then maybe double dip, or what\u2019s your take on top line?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Good morning John, well the first thing I would say is it\u2019s probably too early to be confident about what the fourth quarter looks like.  You know I\u2019m just going to kind of reiterate it, we\u2019re comfortable with our long term financial objectives.  In regard to the tax checks, I mean it\u2019s sort of absolute speculation, anybody\u2019s guess at that point.  We would be happy to see a bump in the marketplace.  But probably difficult to determine what $500-$600 will mean to the average.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "As you guys look at your information, do you think, because obviously there\u2019s been sort of a downward trend on what appears to be real growth or unit growth and I know there\u2019s a lot of things in there.  But have we seen any clear signs there, any stabilization, things getting better or it\u2019s still too tough to tell?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "I don\u2019t think we have any clear signs of that right now John.  You know this is a very volatile environment.  But again I guess that I would just say again that we\u2019re confident about our position in the marketplace.  We do well during difficult times and you know we\u2019re just so well positioned in the way the company is organized and the way it\u2019s performing today that we\u2019re good with whatever comes down the pike at us.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Secondly, you know you guys have done a very good job on the expense side, maybe talk a little bit about what you can do differently going into the new year to maybe lower the rate of growth in SG&A dollars further, if that can be done.  Just on the case that maybe gross profit dollars do come down a little further.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll ask Ken to jump in, or Bill or anyone else to jump in.  But you know I guess broadly what I would say is that we are carefully watching every nickel that we spend.  And we\u2019re just being very diligent about anything that, paperclips to trucks at this point, so I think that message has gone through the entire organization, I think if you\u2019ve gone to the operating companies and we have one of the proper planning process right now, you see a real heightened awareness in terms of where we are, where we are in a macroeconomic environment and what they need to do to control their expenses.", "Ken Spitler", "", "John, this is Ken, our process kind of remains the same.  We go through, and our first level of management of expenses are those things that we feel that don\u2019t affect our people.  We have yet to get deep into the personnel side, so those things that we\u2019ve reduced so far have been areas that we felt were a little fluffy if you will, things like conferences and those kind of costs.  So that was our first wave.  Second wave begins to be if we still see weakness and still see a gross profit dollar slip would be in the area of headcount.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Alright then finally inventories look to be up about 10% or so, was any of that forward buy product and if so do you think that increases going forward?", "Bill DeLaney", "", "I\u2019ll take that one John, its Bill, inventories were up about, with sales growth, we didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think we reduced inventory days, I don\u2019t think they were up materially this quarter.  We\u2019ve got some work to do there, I wouldn\u2019t overplay any forward buy side of it.

A couple of questions.  Could you talk a little bit about fuel surcharges and obviously you have surcharges in most of your contracts, but are you able to pass any of that along to the independent customer or I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re even trying very hard to do that.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Yeah, we certainly for years have had surcharges on, or the ability to put surcharges on for our contract customers.  We do have modest fuel surcharges for independent customers across the system today and we review that on a regular basis as the fuel costs go up, the fuel surcharges go up.  As the fuel costs come down, fuel surcharges come down also.  And that\u2019s both in the case of independents and contract customers.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "And what are you seeing in terms of the competition, are they also pushing through fuel surcharges and do you think they\u2019re also pushing hard on the cost of product?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Sure, absolutely.  We do know that many of our competitors, if not most of our competitors have fuel surcharges across the board.  So you know we think that it\u2019s just the right thing to do in this environment.  If we can convince our customers to buy more product from us, and that\u2019s certainly our goal, then we lower that cost per case related to that fuel surcharge.  So our kind of sales story there and it\u2019s the right one is that the more cases you buy from us, the lower the cost per chase related to that fuel surcharge.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Got it.  And then I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the regional wholesale competitors.  Is there any sense that they are looking to sellout, more actively than they were a couple years ago?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Well it depends on how you would define the regionals.  There are some very large regionals, three or four very large regionals, we have no indication of their interest.  However, again more broadly, we have a lot of activity going on related to potential acquisitions.  As we\u2019ve talked about it\u2019s very, very difficult out there right now and an individual independent distributor\u2019s ability to sort of leverage the costs the way we do across the system, it\u2019s just very difficult and I think that there\u2019s a willingness now on the part of some of owners to monetize their business.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "And my final question is just about receivables.  I noticed that bad debt as a percentage of total receivables went up a little bit.  Is that, I know you guys talk about not taking credits or offering credit I should say.  Are you seeing any issues in terms of your customer\u2019s ability to pay you?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Meredith, no, we\u2019ll take a closer look at that.  I don\u2019t actually think our write offs or anything like that are up at all as a percent of sales, but we\u2019ll look at that a little bit closer.  Where I would characterize where we are in receivables right now is pretty much where we are in terms of the business climate.  I mean it\u2019s a little early to fully evaluate that.  When you have large customers, you know you always have situations that you have to deal with.  But just form a cultural standpoint, we manage credit locally at our op co\u2019s as well as here at corporate on the large accounts.  ", "And to the best of our ability, we don\u2019t sell credit, so we will work with customers obviously, when you get into situations and we know them well and we have some parameters around whatever might be the work out agreement or something like that.  But so far we haven\u2019t seen any major problems but we are keenly watching that and managing that at all levels because clearly in times like this, there will be some situations that we\u2019ll have to deal with.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Great, I did look at it as a percentage of the receivable balance, not as a percentage of sales.  Thanks.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Okay, alright, because actually I think our days are down a couple tenths of a day and so we\u2019re actually pleased with that.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Badishkanian at Citigroup.", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Yeah, great, thanks.  In terms of looking at food inflation, would you say that that had probably a net neutral impact on EBIT dollars and then also you know just looking at your independent customers, how have they fared in terms of passing those prices onto their customers?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "In terms of inflation, I think that we would say that it\u2019s pretty well a net.  So it helps us on the expense line and hurts us on the gross profit line.  Any benefit that we see on the expense line is sheer productivity improvement thanks to the great work of our operating companies.  And your question about the independents Greg?", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Yeah, when you look at those, have they been doing a better or worse job lately in terms of passing on the price increases you\u2019re sending to them, to their end customers?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "I think in general they do a pretty good job of changing their menus and one of our responsibilities, at least as we see it, is to make sure that either through business reviews or communication directly from marketing associates that they\u2019re adjusting the prices on their menus.  And I feel quite good that that\u2019s happening.", "Ken Spitler", "", "Plus the fact that they\u2019ve been in an inflationary period for a while, they\u2019ve had to get better at it.", "Bill DeLaney", "", "Greg, one thing, you\u2019ll see in our release and as we speak here with the call that we talked a lot about growing gross profit dollars faster than expenses.  Now that\u2019s not exactly rocket science type of statements.  The reason we do that is because, it\u2019s really almost, it\u2019s impossible to evaluate on each line the impact of inflation.  To Rick\u2019s point, we generally know it puts pressure on the gross profit line and it makes the expenses look a little better than they probably are.  ", "So our focus here is on growing cases and managing our cost per case and really as long as we can grow that operating profit faster than our sales growth, we feel like we\u2019re doing a pretty good job with the inflationary environment, which, as we\u2019ve spoken to, has been with us now for a year.", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "You did a nice job on that this quarter.  And looking at the pricing environment, you know you\u2019ve got US food service, you\u2019ve got performance food group, have you noticed any changes coming out in terms of some of the bigger players?", "Ken Spitler", "", "No, really we haven\u2019t.  It\u2019s just kind of business as usual.

You know I guess post quarter end and how we should think about things?  You mentioned Easter and the early Easter had an impact on March, you know have you see kind of a give back of that impact as your kind of post quarter end here?  ", "And then related to that, your 7-9% organic sales growth guidance, you know given kind of the nominal top line comparisons are a little tough, should we kind of think about maybe being at the low end or below that in the short term and maybe gaining back into that range as we head into next year?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Well Steve, you know of course that we don\u2019t give guidance.  I will tell you however we\u2019re glad to see the sunshine around most of the country.  It was a pretty tough quarter in terms of the weather.  So by and large, you know, I would say we feel comfortable about our ability to operate in this environment as well as more positive environments.  And you know, too early to tell about the quarter as we\u2019ve said earlier, but we think that those operating companies will respond appropriately and we stick by our longer term projections.", "Steve Chick \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay, alright well that\u2019s helpful.  And then maybe for Bill, I know we\u2019ll get the segment profit data when you file the Q, but obviously your operating expenses were pretty extraordinarily good this quarter, in fact they were down sequentially even with your coaly and your fuel hit, once we get the Q, I mean did you see segment margins that were up, for instance within the Broadline segment?  Can you speak to that a little bit?", "Bill DeLaney", "", "Steve, actually Ken alluded to it in his comments, so yeah on the Broadline sector in particular we saw some good operating leverage and we are pleased with that.", "Steve Chick \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay and so these costs, the cost control initiatives, it sounds like you\u2019re pretty comfortable if things remain tough.  I mean growing SG&A well south of sales and even maybe lower than gross is sustainable at this point?", "Ken Spitler", "", "Yes we can Steve.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "That\u2019s our total focus right now here Steve is to make the best out of the market that we\u2019re in and grow the boxes and manage that cost per case.", "Steve Chick \u2013 J.P.

Two last ones if I could, one I wanted to confirm, Bill is FY09, is that a 53 week year?", "Bill DeLaney", "", "I hope so.", "Ken Spitler", "", "Or it\u2019s a 54.", "Steve Chick \u2013 J.P.

On the other hand, I really feel, although as we\u2019ve said probably enough at this point, it\u2019s a very difficult environment.  I feel that in general our independents are doing well.

They can do that on the fly virtually, we see a lot of that taking place right now.  We\u2019re helping our customers with substitution of items on their menus, with redoing their menus, doing that by the hundreds, literally.

In that environment I think the independents, most of the independents are doing quite well.", "Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research", "And you mentioned earlier that you\u2019re steadily taking share, certainly it\u2019s visible in this environment, but how would you prioritize your objectives to take share in a faster clip as you look out over the next five year\u2019s whether it\u2019s pushing through this environment or coming up with other, getting some more payback from your initiatives, what is your thought process on how you can really go to market in a little stronger fashion and take share at a better clip?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Well I mean it\u2019s a delicate balance.  We are going to protect our earnings but you know we\u2019re looking at more granularly at every marketplace, every customer to see where we can gain share, whether that\u2019s share of wallet in an individual customer, whether that\u2019s a broader market share.  So we\u2019re very focused on that and everything that we\u2019re doing, I mean frankly, is focused on the customer and our ability to better serve those customers.

We\u2019re seeing some improvements in that now but it\u2019s been a very difficult quarter for us in the meat companies.", "Westcott Rochette \u2013 Bear Stearns", "", "Has there been any evidence of your restaurants trading down to lower priced meats, trying to do what they can to bring their menu costs down?", "Ken Spitler", "", "Yeah, we\u2019re seeing some of that, but that\u2019s not our issue there.", "Westcott Rochette \u2013 Bear Stearns", "", "Okay.", "Ken Spitler", "", "Performance. ", "Westcott Rochette \u2013 Bear Stearns", "", "Alright and then lastly, thinking about your cost initiatives with your vendors in terms of your purchase initiatives, with vendors getting kind of squeezed by inflation themselves, have they been more or less receptive to your continued consolidation in terms of better pricing for you and your supply chain initiative and your purchase initiatives?", "Ken Spitler", "", "I\u2019ll let Mr. Pulliam answer that, he\u2019s here with us.", "Larry Pulliam", "", "I would say we\u2019ve seen a little change there.  You know our initiatives are actually committing volume to those suppliers and helping them to take costs out of their system which you know provides us with a lower cost.  So generally have a good feel about where we\u2019re going with sourcing.", "Westcott Rochette \u2013 Bear Stearns", "", "Can you just give broad up data of where you\u2019re progressing on that or where you are?  In terms of, have you rolled out [overlay].", "Larry Pulliam", "", "We\u2019re [overlay].", "Westcott Rochette \u2013 Bear Stearns", "", "Okay.  Well good quarter, thanks guys.", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions) We\u2019ll go next to Andrew Wolf at BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning.  Congratulations for managing so well in this environment.  A few follow ups, some of the things that were said.  Ken when you said the Southwest was doing well, it could be anywhere from California to Texas, is it that broad or is it more traditional Southwest, Arizona.", "Ken Spitler", "", "It\u2019s more traditional Southwest.  You know California has traditionally been like, really powerful for us but it\u2019s not as good as it has been.  So the strength is really in the traditional Southwest.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "And on Florida and the weakness there, I always thought that with Easter came families, vacationing and spring break.  And there\u2019s obviously a regional issue with housing, but are you saying that what happened really was folks actually went east and cut their winter breaks short?  Can you just sort of help me understand that?", "Ken Spitler", "", "Yup, left early.", "Bill DeLaney", "", "The season ended early.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "And that more than offset any benefit that might have happened from the other way around.", "Ken Spitler", "", "There\u2019s just weakness there anyway and then compounded by the fact that they left early created a not good situation in Florida for us.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay on the RDC, I understand you don\u2019t want to be that specific in the guidance but I mean I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s not going to be anything close to what Front Royal was.", "Ken Spitler", "", "No.  Not at all.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "And would you say in terms of how long it, not just in quantity, dollars, but also in terms of how long, length of time, the drag work would occur.", "Ken Spitler", "", "That\u2019s going to be a lot faster.  We\u2019re already seeing that.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "And you also mentioned you know that the dollar expense swing from fuel is going to double from $12 million to $20-$25 million, now is that a gross number before you can recoup some of that or is that just net of?", "Ken Spitler", "", "It is a gross number.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay and what\u2019s been the experience in terms of how much you can recoup when it goes up that quickly?", "Bill DeLaney", "", "It\u2019s been relatively modest so far.  I mean as was pointed out earlier, we\u2019ve got contracts with our larger customers but it\u2019s, we\u2019ll update you in the Q as that becomes a more meaningful number.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay.  And your business in Canada, you said the business is running down 2%, is that sort of the US or is that kind of North America, including Canada?  And also the exchange rate in Canada has been very favorable, could you help us quantify in any way how that might have affected your quarter.", "Ken Spitler", "", "The rate or the business?", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Well that was a two part question, one business and one financial.", "Ken Spitler", "", "The business is about the same in the US as it is in Canada.  The rate I believe is neutral, isn\u2019t it?  Favorable?", "Bill DeLaney", "", "It\u2019s not a big number, it\u2019s slightly favorable.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "It\u2019s not material but it is slightly favorable.  I just want to be clear, just so we\u2019re clear, the 2% down is kind of our view of what the overall US market for food service, for our business is right now.", "Ken Spitler", "", "We\u2019re seeing about the same in Canada.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "I think the only difference we\u2019re seeing in Canada is the inflation is not quite as high in Canada as what we\u2019re seeing here.", "Bill DeLaney", "", "And Canada is doing very well, I mean they\u2019re operating very well.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "And lastly, Rick, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re still there, on the market share side, kind of sounds to me as if given what\u2019s going on in the market, you guys can win through attrition and just letting a lot of the capacity go away either through acquisition or just outright failure, more so than having to be proactive by adding, going to price or something, is that sort of the game plan if you will?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s right and I think acquisition and attrition in the marketplace is a good strategy for us rather than to sacrifice price in any big way.", "Bill DeLaney", "", "I think it\u2019d be fair to say, we\u2019re a lot more focused on our customers than worrying about what the competitors are doing right now.  If we can keep our customers moving forward or at least holding ground in this type of environment then we\u2019re going to be in good shape.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Andy you said you\u2019re glad I\u2019m here, I\u2019m not glad I\u2019m here, my flights been delayed.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "I guess that\u2019s another function of the weather or the airline industry, anyway, thanks and congrats on the quarter.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Alec Patterson at RCM.", "Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM", "Good morning.  I may have missed it, did you guys have any M&A impact on sales?", "Bill DeLaney", "", "Nothing significant.", "Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM", "Okay.  And also just the COGS inflation number you guys put out, I forget, is that inclusive or exclusive of the sourcing program.  In other words, is that unique to you or is that kind of an industry trend across your product categories?", "Bill DeLaney", "", "It\u2019s our best measure of our product cost and it would include sourcing which is relatively de minimus right now in the overall mathematical part of it.", "Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM", "Okay I thought you were running close to about 5% of COGS that was under the program.", "Bill DeLaney", "", "I say de minimus, that means 95% of it isn\u2019t.  So it\u2019s not really driving the number I guess what I\u2019m trying to say.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "It may be contributing but not driving the number.", "Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM", "Okay, fair enough.  And then on the shipping and handling trends for the year, excluding fuel, I know you\u2019ve got the mileage programs and other things going, how is that trending maybe as a percent of sales or any sort of indicator that we could get on that.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Alec are you talking about the kind of XY routing and how we\u2019re getting efficient routing of trucks?", "Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM", "Yeah in terms of how it boils down to that shipping and handling number excluding the fuel component.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Just broadly if you took the fuel out, the shipping and handling, our warehousing and delivery would be showing slight improvements.  You know we\u2019re very pleased with the productivity improvements that we\u2019re seeing in the warehouse and delivery.", "Bill DeLaney", "", "Miles are down.  And to Rick\u2019s point, we\u2019re doing a nice job in warehouse right now.", "Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM", "So if your real growth is just a little bit more than flat, then I would assume shipping and handling ex fuel is flat to down?", "Ken Spitler", "", "It\u2019s down.", "Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM", "It\u2019s down.  With a capital D?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "D-O-W-N, how\u2019s that work?", "Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM", "Okay, fair enough, thanks very much.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is a follow up from Meredith Adler at Lehman Brothers.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Thanks.  I think we\u2019ve asked questions about the ability of your customers to pass along the higher costs.  But are you, I mean you kind of answered the question that the industry volume is down about 2%.  Is the message coming from customers that there is a fair amount of pushback from their consumers in terms of the higher prices or just because of the economy and fuel prices?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "I think it\u2019s more, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a factor of pricing going up on menus, I think it\u2019s more a factor of the cost of fuel and disposable income.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay and then I just want to follow up on the question about the RDC, I understand you don\u2019t want to quantify the cost, I think you said it\u2019s not huge, will it continue into the fourth quarter and then actually you said you had five op co\u2019s up and running, what is the, for that region, how many op co\u2019s will you get to eventually?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Five is the number for that RDC.  We\u2019re shipping them all, we\u2019re shipping them all everyday right now.", "Ken Spitler", "", "And that\u2019s really just different from the way we ramped the other one where we started with one op co and one product zone and then the next zone and the next op co.  So we just ramped everybody up at the same time.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay and the costs will continue in the fourth quarter?", "Rick Schnieders", "", "That\u2019s what we were speaking to Meredith, our fourth quarter and probably even a little in the first quarter of the new year.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay and then just along with that, you should be working on the next RDC, is that right, can you give us an update?", "Ken Spitler", "", "Yeah but we have it designed, it\u2019s done.  We haven\u2019t decided when we\u2019re going to start it up yet.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay and do you have a location though, is that right?", "Ken Spitler", "", "Yes we do in Indiana.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay, great, but you haven\u2019t started construction yet?", "Ken Spitler", "", "No.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "And we will take our final question as a follow up from Steve Chick from J.P. Morgan.", "Steve Chick \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Thanks.  Just on the targeted increase in your sales contact personnel, Ken sometimes you give us the number on what it was for the quarter.  And if you kind of still are on track for a 4% increase or if actually that might be a place where maybe you could save some costs?", "Ken Spitler", "", "Well we\u2019re not looking to save any costs there, that\u2019s not our program.  Again we\u2019ve had more, it\u2019s flat right now, third quarter, typically in the fourth quarter is where we start brining on the marketing associate training classes.  But right now we\u2019re behind pace on that 4%, not as a, lay up on our business review folks.", "Steve Chick \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay and I\u2019m sorry when you said it was flat for the quarter, is that kind of, flat year over year?", "Ken Spitler", "", "Uh huh.", "Steve Chick \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay and it was up if I remember 4.5% in the first half [overlay]?", "Ken Spitler", "", "[Unintelligible].", "Steve Chick \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "And with no further [overlay].", "Ken Spitler", "", "But we\u2019re up on total contact, we\u2019re just flat on MAs, just a clarification.", "Rick Schnieders", "", "Steve one of the reasons we kind of backed off on that level of disclosures, you know to Ken\u2019s point, it\u2019ll move around from quarter to quarter, it\u2019s very much market specific.  I mean what you\u2019re going to do in a Carolina type of market and what you might do in the Midwest in terms of the rate of growth would be different.  So we understand the importance of growing our customer contact people and we\u2019ll continue to do that.", "Steve Chick \u2013 J.P.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neal Russell, Assistance Vice President Investor Relations.", "Neal Russell", "Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for SYSCO\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 conference call. On today\u2019s call you will hear from Richard Schnieders, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ken Spitler, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill DeLaney, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we begin please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. ", "Actual results could differ in a material manner.

", "We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website at www.sisco.com.", "Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 or between the full year of 2008 and the full year 2007 unless otherwise noted. Also all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. ", "I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Schnieders.", "Richard Schnieders", "Thanks Neal, welcome and thank you for joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in SYSCO. Here are the headlines; 5.4% sales growth for the quarter and 7.1% sales growth for the year. What\u2019s important to note are the results coming from the operating companies where they were able to leverage the 7% growth in sales to three points of leverage to 10% operating income. ", "And in total we leveraged to 13% EPS growth for fiscal 2008 consistent with our long-term objectives. In addition we returned 90% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Ken for details on how all of this was achieved and I\u2019ll be back for the Q&A. ", "Ken Spitler", "Thanks Richard, and good morning to everyone. As Richard just said, 2008 was a solid year. For the full year sales grew $2.5 billion to $37.5 billion. Further operating income grew 10% to $1.9 billion. Net earnings grew by more than $100 million to $1.1 billion. Earnings per share grew 13%, return on total capital grew by one point to 21%, return on equity exceeded 33%, and we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases.", "These results reflect the diligent efforts of our 50,000 associates to support our customers and improve productivity in all aspects of our business. Physical 2008 certainly presented us with obstacles to overcome including ever increasing fuel prices, persistent inflation and a challenging demand environment, each of which impacted our results.", "However, our relentless focus on supporting our customers and improving our operational capabilities resulted in strong earnings during this challenging time. Our sales growth in the fourth quarter was indicative of the overall market environment. In the midst of declining demand we focused on efforts on stringent expense control resulting in strong operating leverage.", "For the full year SYSCO sales growth of 7.1% continued to outpace the industry growth as we consistently gained market share. Unmistakably operating leverage was a driving force of our success during the year. We implemented several initiatives over time that have positioned SYSCO as the leader in the industry. ", "They included programs such as activity-based pay, which aligns the compensation of certain associates with work completed rather than time on the job to improved productivity and cost controls. Also we continue to manage increased fuel costs by reducing the number of stops, increasing cases per truck, reducing idling time and placing governors on portions of our fleet that prevent trucks from exceeding 60 miles per hour, which not only helps save fuel but improves safety.", "We moved forward with out centralized sourcing program in 2008, leveraging the power of the entire corporation to reduce costs while streamlining our inventory. We also continued to manage miles; an ongoing process for SYSCO. We used our transportation management system to streamline inbound freight while our XY routing process minimized miles driven on outbound shipments. ", "Combined these two initiatives helped reduce our costs, solidify our competitive position and importantly, reduce negative environmental impact. Food inflation as measured by our internal measure of product cost inflations has been consistent averaging about 6.2% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. ", "The product categories of canned and dry and dairy have had the largest impacts for the year. The balance of inflation costs were spread across several categories. Although we don\u2019t forecast inflation, we anticipate product costs to increase for the foreseeable future. ", "As the industry leader, we will continue to invest back in our business to maintain and grow our competitive advantages. We expanded the Broadline business by opening one additional facility in Knoxville, Tennessee during fiscal 2008 and expect to open another in East Texas in physical 2009.", "We are encouraged with the progress we made during fiscal 2008 and remain confident that the successful execution of our business plan will position us well to participate in the growth and success of our customers in the future.", "Looking back on the momentum the company gained during physical 2007 and built upon in 2008, I am confident we have the right people and the right plan to deliver in fiscal 2009.", "In summary we had another solid year from an operational and financial standpoint. I\u2019d like to thank the entire SYSCO team for their leadership and hard work. Now Bill will review some additional financial details for the fourth quarter and total year. ", "Bill DeLaney", "Thanks Ken and good morning everyone. As Richard and Ken just said we are pleased with our financial results for 2008. There are a few items regarding the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 financial results that I would like to briefly discuss.", "First operating expenses for the quarter included a negative year-over-year comparison of approximately $8.4 million related to our investment in company owned life insurance or COLI. Also during the quarter we incurred charges totaling $12.9 million related to multi-employer pension plans. Separately we had favorable comparisons of $2.7 million related to stock-based compensation and of $2.2 million related to company-sponsored pension plan expense.", "For the quarter these items resulted in a net $16.4 million unfavorable impact on operating income growth. For the full year we had an unfavorable comparison of $24.2 million for these same items. Clearly the ability of the company to not only offset these cost pressures but continue to leverage sales growth is indicative of the high level of execution taking place at our operating companies.", "Notwithstanding the favorable impact of the initiatives discussed by Ken, higher fuel prices negatively impacted SYSCO\u2019s operating expenses by $16 million during the fourth quarter and $34 million during the fiscal year. Approximately 75% of the $34 million increase in fuel expense for the year was recovered through incremental fuel surcharges.", "Looking forward we expect that increases in fuel costs will negatively impact the year-over-year cost comparisons by approximately $60 million to $70 million for the first six months of fiscal 2009. We expect to recover approximately half of those additional fuel costs during the first six months of fiscal 2009 through increased fuel surcharges.", "These estimates include the impact of forward purchase contracts for approximately 30% of our fuel needs through the mid point of the second quarter that we\u2019ve already committed to and assume the remainder of our fuel needs are purchased at current spot price levels. ", "Our cash flows and balance sheet remained strong in 2008 and are a competitive advantage for SYSCO. going forward we expect capital spending of fiscal 2009 to be in the range of approximately $675 million to $725 million primarily for land and facilities in our core business.", "We also continue to look for acquisitions in conjunction with our strategic business goals and we expect to continue to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing shares and growing the dividend commensurate with our earnings growth.", "As we begin fiscal 2009 we remain committed to the success of our customers. We are pleased with our overall performance for fiscal 2008 but realize significant challenges lie ahead. Today\u2019s difficult market environment demands that we further improve our productivity in all aspects of our business so that we remain well positioned to sustain profitable sales growth for the foreseeable future. ", "And with that, we\u2019ll now take questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Your margins were greater then what I was and I\u2019m assuming the street modeled out, in order of magnitude what were the drivers leading to only 4% operating expense growth this quarter in an inflationary environment?", "Richard Schnieders", "There were probably a number of things that took place and Ken alluded to a couple of them, but certainly the more efficient routing of our trucks, the fact that we\u2019re putting more cases on the trucks, we\u2019re getting more productivity in the warehouses. Frankly we\u2019re getting more productivity throughout the organization. Our productivity in the total organization continues to improve. ", "So broadly its just in good tight expense control and in awareness that the operating companies in all levels of the business that that is a focus for us and we\u2019ve talked to everyone that has any influence at all that this is going to be the next 12 to 18 months at least in our mind, that we have to be very, very sharp at the expense line.  ", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Do you feel that there\u2019s more opportunity over the coming quarters to continue to cut out expenses or have you, do you think you\u2019ve maximized those initiatives?", "Richard Schnieders", "No I think that we all recognize there are other opportunities for us to continue to get more efficient and more productive in the ways we work. ", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Looking at, you had mentioned that SYSCO had gained share in the quarter, or at least in the full year, can you talk a bit about in the quarter maybe what you think the industry was growing at and if you gained share, what types of customers. Was it your customers growing faster, were you gaining share of new customers?", "Richard Schnieders", "I think we gained, without having our data right now, but I think we gained share in the fourth quarter at the same rate that we gained share throughout the year and I would once again, point to the success we\u2019ve had with the business review process. I think that the companies continue to execute extremely well in the business reviews. And we had another good year of business reviews in 2008 and we\u2019re starting off 2009 on a similar trajectory. ", "So the one thing that I would point to would certainly be, in terms of gaining share, would be the business review process. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Are you still seeing growth from new customers, that the MAs out in the field are they still winning new business? ", "Richard Schnieders", "We are certainly picking up new customers. We had a good year of picking up new customers. At the same time our penetration continues to improve but, yes, I think we\u2019re focused on new customers. Having said that I would also say that today, and we\u2019ve said this before, we\u2019re doing a better job in terms of qualifying customers to make sure that they indeed fit our system and our strategy. So yes, we\u2019re definitely picking up new customers; probably the biggest contributor to overall sales growth right now. ", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Drilling down a little bit on the gross margin line, I think we were a little bit surprised to see it, basically flat, we thought it might be down just given inflation and the way some of the math works on your contracted business where you have a fixed fee. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on there? Is it really just about making sure you pass through the inflation or are there some productivity improvements within the gross margin line that are helping that stay flat?", "Bill DeLaney", "There\u2019s always a lot going on on the gross margin line and frankly that\u2019s why we try to steer people toward the operating margin line because there\u2019s so many things going on in a given quarter between customers and products and inflation. The one thing I will say to you here is the fuel surcharges that we alluded to in terms of the year and kind of our best guess going forward for the next six months, we did ramp that initiative up significantly in the fourth quarter and the accounting for that is such that fuel expense hits the cost line or the expense line and these fuel surcharges hit the revenue line so that did help a little bit, more so in the fourth quarter then earlier in the year.", "But in addition to that, its just a lot of what Richard just talked about and what we speak about in the release and in the script that we just went through, which is its just managing at the customer level as best as you can day in and day out so that you\u2019re responding to what the customers\u2019 needs are but also trying to do what we need to do from shareholder perspective. ", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "On inflation, you mentioned a few different product categories where you experienced higher then the average inflation, as we look out we\u2019ve been hearing that protein, the center of the plate items might be experiencing more inflation here I guess in the second half of the calendar year, is there a difference in the way that the center of the plate items are priced that might result in some differences in what you\u2019re experiencing things on the gross margin line? ", "Richard Schnieders", "Well I think first of all, we have not seen the protein, the center of the plate protein, items to be the main contributor to the inflation at least in the most recent past. In fact there are four categories that are contributing most of the inflation right now. Three of those are related to vegetables and fruits and the other one is dairy. Meat proteins have not been the biggest contributor to inflation so it\u2019s a little bit hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen going forward. However, having said that the big contributor is sort of on the grains and the vegetables and the fruits, those categories, those products mostly come to harvest starting about right now for the next couple, three months. ", "So we think that based on what we know right now the supplies are going to be pretty good. So frankly it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. This has been a very, very volatile market for the last couple of years. If the dollar continues to strengthen I think that we will continue to see the oil prices come down and we track commodities, corn and soy beans specifically against oil, and they\u2019re tailing down now also as the dollar has gotten stronger. ", "If anybody can predict all of those various components, frankly they\u2019re better then we are. It would be just a guess at this point, but we\u2019re operating as if we\u2019re going to have some inflation for the next while yet. ", "Ken Spitler", "To answer your question on the pricing side of it, center of the plate is generally priced weekly or at the time of sale. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Can you talk to sales progression and did you see kind of a constant softening trend during the quarter and has that continued in to the new year? Do we have any sense whether we\u2019ve hit bottom or not yet? ", "Richard Schnieders", "That\u2019s another one of those sorts of prognostications that\u2019s difficult to address. Obviously we\u2019re in difficult macroeconomic environment. We did see declining sequential sales growth through the fiscal year not necessarily through the quarter. What we\u2019ve been encouraged about is our ability to continue by working with our customers to take share in this marketplace and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on our ability to control costs and live by our commitment to leverage up our top line sales growth into the operating line and into the EPS. ", "At this point, I guess, we would all hope that fuel at the pump is going to continue to come down. Obviously that\u2019s a contributor to the overall macro environment and to the restaurant business in general so again, we\u2019re going to manage the business as tough as we\u2019ve been managing it for the last year going forward. ", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "But if you look at the last month or two, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily be below that 5.4 for the quarter? [inaudible] the assumption that you\u2019re running below that today? ", "Richard Schnieders", "No. ", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "It would be fault or it wouldn\u2019t be? ", "Richard Schnieders", "It would not--", "Bill DeLaney", "Obviously we don\u2019t give a lot of forward looking commentary on sales growth. We\u2019re running about where we were running for the quarter. We\u2019re only four or five weeks into the new quarter.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "If you look at MA growth in terms of positions, where did we end up in 2008 percent growth and what do you think we end up in 2009?", "Ken Spitler", "We\u2019re flat for 2008 but we increased our business review people. ", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So flat in terms of total number of positions? ", "Ken Spitler", "MAs. ", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And what about 2009 do you think?", "Ken Spitler", "I don\u2019t anticipate that we\u2019re going to grow them more than probably about 2%. We\u2019re still adding business review people. ", "Richard Schnieders", "Let me be clear about that and make the distinction again that Ken is making and that is that our marketing associate growth in 2008 was flat but we did add business review folks and business development folks. So I just wanted to make that distinction. ", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "In terms of centralized purchasing where are we now in terms of number of categories and amount of volume impacted? Where do you think we go over the next 12 months? ", "Richard Schnieders", "I think there were some comments made in the script that we continue to be very favorable toward our overall sourcing program and the total company has really gotten behind it. So we\u2019re just continuing on as we have been. We\u2019re going to continue to add more categories; I don\u2019t even have a number today in terms of what we\u2019re going to add. But we feel good about that program and we\u2019re going to continue to add products and categories throughout 2009.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Wasn\u2019t the last wave something like $4 billion or $5 billion of sales or no? ", "Richard Schnieders ", "Four or $5 billion? No. ", "Bill DeLaney", "The last wave would have got us to $3 billion. ", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And are we into the next wave yet, or no? Or are we still in the $3 billion wave?", "Bill DeLaney", "We\u2019re in the next wave. Obviously now we do renewals on the earlier waves of products and we add new categories as well. ", "Richard Schnieders", "The $3 billion is a cumulative number. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Was there any\u2014can you explain why this quarter there was no share buyback activity?", "Bill DeLaney", "Let me be as straightforward and as oblique as I can be here, but we, as we got into the quarter we were assessing a potential opportunity that we felt that if it did develop further could be significant and so we chose not to buy shares. Since that time the opportunity has not developed and we\u2019ve moved on. So you will see us come back into the market here once our blackout period is lifted. ", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Onto this multi-employer pension liability that cost you a lot of money the last couple of quarters, in the Q for the third quarter there\u2019s some commentary suggesting\u2014is there any update on that? Have you got a better feel for what that could turn out to be for the company?", "Bill DeLaney", "Are you talking about aggregate exposure or are you talking about specific commentary on any given one plan that we be in? ", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "It\u2019s the multi-employer pension plan liability this quarter; it hit you by $22 million in the last couple of quarters.", "Bill DeLaney", "It is for $22 million for the year and about $13 million I think for the quarter, right. And so the quarter was a combination of a couple of different plans that we participate in and I think we have given disclosure in the past Ks and I guess Qs that theoretically there\u2019s a number out there in the $135 million to $140 million range that, its not the most current number in the world, we do the best we can to get that data so. Of that, say its $140 million, we\u2019ve affectively provided for about $20 million of it at this point. ", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "So did that mean that could be an ongoing expense in the ballpark of what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters? ", "Bill DeLaney", "It\u2019s really hard to predict. I\u2019ll give you a little commentary on this one. The $140 million number that I spoke to is that\u2019s our exposure theoretically in all of our plans. What you\u2019ve seen this year is one plan in particular that was in a little more critical situation where we had to address some funding and potential withdraw liability issues so that one has its own situation if you will. And we also had actually another situation where we decertified in a small union and that created a need to put up a withdraw liability provision.", "It\u2019s kind of case by case. And where we have opportunities to decertify and those aren\u2019t frequent we tend to take advantage of them so, I can\u2019t give you a real clear answer in terms of the future other than the bulk of this $22 million is one plan. It\u2019s a very unique situation and we\u2019ll just have to play it quarter by quarter at this point. ", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "In the past you\u2019ve given a sense of what the company\u2019s sponsored pensions, what kind of change to or swing in earnings that might occur. This year you picked up a little bit on that in earnings, and perhaps stock compensation expense, do you clarity on that?", "Bill DeLaney", "We\u2019ve got developing clarity and as you notice in the release we basically just went ahead and put this stuff in a table, some of these items which\u2014I can\u2019t call them non-recurring but they\u2019re hard to predict but the two that I think we can speak to somewhat today and I think with more clarity when we file the K and even more so after the first quarter are the two that you mentioned. So the pension helped us this year by about $9 million, this is the company-sponsored pension. And the stock comp helped us I think by $17 million or $18 million. ", "Looking forward on the pension, that\u2019s going to go the other way in 2009. That\u2019s probably going to hurt us some where\u2019s around $20 million give or take. We\u2019ll tighten that up as we file the K. That\u2019s being largely driven by just what you would expect which is what\u2019s been going on in the financial markets and certainly our investments have participated in that. ", "And then on the stock comp, that\u2019s a little trickier but our best judgment today would be that that would be favorable next year by about $20 million. So the two would roughly offset, my only caveat on the stock comp, is a significant amount of that number is stock options which are approved by our Board of Directors an that won\u2019t happen until we get into the fall. So that number is not really a firm number but out best judgment today is that those two numbers will roughly offset in 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "I just wanted to ask about the health of the independents out there. We\u2019ve seen a number of bankruptcies out there amongst restaurants and I was wondering what color you might be able to give. Obviously you\u2019re taking market share but I imagine there are also some of your accounts that may be struggling due to the overall environment. What are you seeing in terms of an increase or a decrease in those sorts of trends?", "Richard Schnieders", "I think its definitely, there\u2019s no question, we\u2019ve said in a couple of different ways I guess, that it\u2019s a very challenging environment out there and of course everyone read about [Bennington\u2019s] and Steak and Ale, but I would have to say too, and this is something we\u2019ve said before, that generally our customer base tends to be a very high quality customer base. Our customers have been in business for a long time. We anticipate that they will weather this storm. ", "Now having said that I think its definitely a challenging time for then and again the business reviews are where we go in and try to help them with their operational issues and their menus and what we\u2019ve found most recently over the past couple of quarters has been, in this difficult environment our customers are coming to us to ask for business reviews, to ask for more information, to ask them to help them get through this difficult time. ", "So it is tough but I think that our customers generally are doing well and we\u2019re doing everything we can to help them in their business. ", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "In terms of helping them in order to do that, do you think in the next six months or so, let\u2019s assume that inflation stays at these sorts of levels, do you think it may\u2014you\u2019ve been very successful in being able to pass through fuel surcharges and inflated costs, do you think your ability to do that will\u2014and hold onto the level of sales that you have and retain the health of your customer base, can continue and you can continue to push through those costs or do you think that it may get more difficult to do that? ", "Richard Schnieders", "I\u2019m confident that we can continue to do that. I would say that over the last few months we\u2019ve learned better how to communicate with our customers, even those that don\u2019t go through a business review. One of the key activities or key things that a restaurant has to do today is make sure they keep up with their pricing, their cost on their menu prices. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been, I think very good at, I think the customers in turn have responded well to the suggestions that we\u2019ve made. ", "In the past we\u2019ve had customers that haven\u2019t changed their menu pricing for seven or eight years and in this environment that\u2019s absolutely deadly. So I think that our companies have done a terrific job in terms of helping with that particular item and others but making sure that our customers are keeping up with the menu pricing. ", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "Has there been any change in your allowance for bad debts or any update on how that looks? ", "Bill DeLaney", "Nothing significant. When you\u2019ll see the K you\u2019ll find that the ratios for bad debt and write-offs are pretty comparable to what they\u2019ve been running.

", "Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM", "I guess I\u2019m just trying to back into the traditional real growth number, it\u2019s slightly negative, and that\u2019s just the way to put it? ", "Bill DeLaney", "That\u2019s correct also. ", "Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM", "And part of the overall sales looks like the other segment soft again, can you sort of speak to what\u2019s going on there if anything? As far as other. ", "Richard Schnieders", "I think that we\u2019ve had a challenging year particularly in the meat business early on with the high cost of raw materials in beef and pork to a certain extent, lesser in poultry but I think that\u2019s been a tough business for us and for others. It\u2019s been a challenging year. ", "Ken Spitler", "And predominantly the softness you see there is in the meat companies. [inaudible] had a pretty good year and the produce companies had a pretty good year but they\u2019ve had kind of a perfect storm of bad circumstances. ", "Alec Patterson \u2013 RCM", "Are you saying that it\u2019s a tough year because people are eating less of that product line or the inflation trend, or\u2014not quite clear on that? ", "Richard Schnieders", "I think what\u2019s happened in a lot of cases is we\u2019ve seen trading down so we\u2019ve seen trading down from tenderloins down to flatiron steaks, from strip steaks down to any number of things. I think there\u2019s been a lot of substituting going on, although the pounds are not off as much as the dollars are, it\u2019s because of the shifting mix.

Please go ahead Sir. ", "Neal Russell", "Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for SYSCO\u2019s first quarter 2009 conference call. On today\u2019s call you will hear from Richard Schnieders, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ken Spitler, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill DeLaney, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Also all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. ", "With that out of the way, I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Schnieders.", "Richard Schnieders", "Here are the headlines. This morning\u2019s fiscal reported record first quarter operating earnings of $5.5 billion, an increase of over 11% compared to last year. Sales grew more than $400 million to $9.9 billion. We also reported record first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.46, up 7% year-over-year. I am pleased with these results as SYSCO continues to grow share and increased operating leverage despite a difficult operating environment. Ken and Bill will provide additional details of our first quarter results and I will be back to facilitate our Q&A session. ", "Ken? ", "Ken Spitler", "", "Thanks Rick. Good morning to all of you. Our operating companies produced exceptional operating leverage in a very soft sales environment. Obviously these are difficult economic times not just for us but for our customers too. Therefore, improving productivity and controlling expenses are very important. ", "During the first quarter SYSCO\u2019s U.S. broad line companies performed particularly well as evidenced by a 6% year-over-year improvement in cases per man-hour, a 3% increase in cases per trip and an 8% reduction in diesel gallon usage. ", "Performing quality business reviews with our best customers remains a top priority as it is increasingly important for us to strengthen those relationships by supporting our customer\u2019s efforts to provide value added offerings to their patrons. We continue to improve the quality of these business reviews with the business review process through better preparation, increased focus on the goals of each review and timely and thorough follow-up subsequent to each review. ", "Also we are encouraged by the progress we see in our supply chain initiative. Productivity has steadily improved in our Front Royal, Virginia RDC and we remain on target for the ramp up timeline for our Alachua, Florida RDC. Our national transportation management system continues to enhance our overall performance as well. Simply stated, we continue to find ways to be more efficient in the near-term which we believe will continue to pay dividends in the long-term. ", "Inflation, as measured by our product cost increases, for the quarter was an extraordinarily high 8.3%. While we have managed the inflationary environment successfully for several quarters, we are keenly sensitive to the difficulties that this unprecedented period of high food prices present to our customers. We hope to see inflation moderate over the long-term and input costs have recently declined. An example of the outstanding execution required to produce these kinds of results is evident in how well our company responded to four named hurricanes across our system during the quarter including hurricane Ike which impacted us right here in Houston. ", "Within hours of the eye of the storm passing over the city our Houston operating company, assisted by associates from several other surrounding companies, was delivering to our customers. We are proud to have worked alongside organizations like the Red Cross, FEMA, numerous hospitals, nursing homes, care shelters to assist those in need. SYSCO was not only early to respond to the relief efforts but importantly was first to be back out on the road working with our customers within a day of the storm. ", "I expect SYSCO to emerge from the business cycle stronger and much more efficient. ", "With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill for a discussion of our financial results for the quarter. ", "Bill DeLaney", "", "Good morning everyone. I am assuringly pleased with the quality of the earnings we reported earlier this morning. As Rick and Ken have previously noted the ongoing economic slow down and turbulent markets in general certainly contributed to our modest sales growth. With that said, our ability to produce 7% diluted earnings per share growth despite an unusually high tax rate and a $30 million unfavorable COLI comparison highlights the quality of the first quarter earnings. ", "One area that warrants further discussion is the first quarter tax rate which was impacted by two main components. First, the loss of $22.9 million recorded to adjust the carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance to the cash render value is nondeductible for income tax purposes. As a reminder, the COLI value will continue to fluctuate each quarter as the underlying securities are tied to market performance. ", "Second, the company recorded a tax adjustment for a previously unidentified tax contingency arising from a recent tax audit. I should not that this adjustment is not related to the ongoing appeals process with the IRS regarding our cooperative structure. Notwithstanding the current financial markets, our balance sheet is a tremendous competitive advantage for SYSCO. We continue to manage our assets and capital effectively as evidenced by our trailing 12-month 21% return on total capital and 33% return on equity. ", "Our A1+ P1 commercial paper rating has proved beneficial to us in the past, present and we expect it to continue to benefit us in the future.  Although our borrowing requirements during the first quarter were modest, we believe we will continue to access the capital markets effectively. ", "In summary, SYSCO can and will continue to reinvest in our business. Our investment priorities in order are capital expenditures, pursuit of acquisitions, growing a dividend commensurate with earnings and repurchasing our common shares. ", "Before we go to the Q&A let me turn it back over to Rick. ", "Richard Schnieders", "", "As you have heard, we are pleased with our first quarter results. It is a tough environment but the quality of earnings is impressive. Our operating companies have done an outstanding job. Our trucks have more cases on them. We are driving fewer miles per route and our customer service continues to lead the industry. As we speak, 8,000 marketing associates are taking orders up to 5 p.m. today. Those orders will ship tomorrow to more than 400,000 customers with premier service levels. ", "I want to say again, however, this is a very challenging environment. In the second quarter we continue to see a softening of sales growth. We will continue to focus on supporting our customers while improving productivity and managing expenses. SYSCO is well positioned to weather the storm and well positioned for the long-term. ", "Operator, we will now take questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup. ", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "First, food inflation was around 8.3% in the quarter so that is higher than it has been around the 6% range and I\u2019m just wondering how you think that is going to trend over the next few quarters? When do you think declining commodity costs will start to lead to that inflation moderating? Just because I know you have a lot of contracts I\u2019m wondering about the timing of that. ", "Richard Schnieders", "", "As Ken indicated in his comments, some of our input costs are beginning to decline now. We see some sub categories of product now that certainly the rate of inflation is slowing, a couple of sub categories where we are actually seeing some deflation. At the same time we have some categories that have fairly high inflation. As we suggested, we would hope to see some moderation in the inflation rate here pretty shortly within this quarter or the next one. ", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Also, as you kind of look at your real sales it was down a few points about 3% or so based on my calculations yet you were able to bring down your SG&A and operating expenses as a percentage of sales. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us some color in terms of the different initiatives and how much of that was due to cutting miles or just different buckets where you have been able to really keep a lid on expenses. ", "Richard Schnieders", "", "We have got fairly high variable costs so we are able to scale the business appropriately both ways. Certainly the initiatives going back, just to point to one and you can\u2019t just point to one but I\u2019ll use it as an example, XY routing Ken mentioned we are driving 8% fewer miles right now than we were a year ago\u2026I\u2019m sorry, gallons. Our miles are down also. It is those kinds of paying attention to literally hundreds of opportunities within those operating companies that are paying results. We feel very good again about the quarter and the operating companies\u2019 ability to manage a rough environment. ", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Just from what we see in the industry looking at the major public companies, etc. it seems like the industry is doing a lot worse than you have. I\u2019m assuming you have picked up some share. Is that what you see based on your data or based on talking to people in the field? What kind of color do you have in terms of market share? ", "Richard Schnieders", "", "That is something we have been very proud of and in fact as we have said on many occasions we tend to do better in tougher times in relation to the rest of the industry because of our financial strength and the overall management of the company. We are pleased, again, with our ability to at the operating company level particularly be able to make it work in a challenging environment. ", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "If you are taking a little bit of share are you hearing anything about some of your competitors?

We have definitely seen a decline in some commodities, especially for the grain, but I\u2019ve heard from some sources that meat prices and all proteins are likely to go up. I think that is the [SEA] forecast as well. Is that something that you have factored into your thinking? Are you seeing any of that? ", "Richard Schnieders", "", "As usual, if you kind of look at the averages it is a bit deceiving. What we find today are the middle meats, those meats that are used to cut steaks. So the strip loins, rib eyes and tenderloins are actually fairly significant lower than they were a year ago. On the other hand you\u2019ve got the end cuts, the chucks and rounds that are higher. Part of the reason for that is a lot of that gets ground into hamburger and the demand for hamburger right now and ground beef is fairly high. It is obviously a lower cost item on the menu. That is where it becomes tricky talking about inflation in general or inflation in a category. In this case you have to look deeper than the category. You have to look at the sub-category. All of that kind of depends. I think it is safe to say because of demand we won\u2019t see upward pressure on the middle meats, the steak cuts, for awhile unless we have a foreign country that jumps in and buys a bunch of boneless rib eyes and boneless rib steaks. That could change that. There are just so many moving parts to the question and the answer.

I was wondering though if you are gaining new customers. How does the profitability of a new customer compare with wooing sales with an existing customer which obviously you are doing some of that too because of business reviews.

In terms of new customers, what we watch very carefully is the ratio of new customers to lost customers to customer penetration which is growing the business in the customer base. You need a balance of that to continue to be profitable in the distribution business so you have got to keep having new customers on board. We are actually seeing a higher rate than normal coming on but commercially we are also seeing there is a bit of moderation in the penetration so as yet that hasn\u2019t been big enough to affect our profitability but it is something we watch every week.

", "Ken Spitler", "", "It moderates I think currently and it changes of course with how you are hedged, but currently moderated about 70% of that cost. Right now we do have a fuel surcharge on everyone. The difference between a blanket charge or per delivery charge on the non-contracted business and then generally speaking it is a sliding scale for the contracted customers. It is still markedly over last year, of course down sequentially from last month. It is one of those things that is very sensitive so we are constantly looking to see if there should be one and what it should be. There is a lot of factors of course in that.

What we are projecting right now for the first six months, obviously we have got four months behind us and three that we have reported. We would expect, and this factors in the forwards we have in place as well as today\u2019s price at the pump, we would expect our fuel cost gross to be up $40-50 million for the first six months and we would expect to recover the bulk of that through fuel surcharges assuming no changes in spot prices and assuming no changes in fuel surcharges. Going forward for the rest of the year we are about 2/3 of our volume is locked in on forwards and about 1/3 of it we will be buying spot. So we are, as Ken alluded to, locked into some higher prices right now on the buy because of the forwards and we will continue to evaluate the fuel surcharges as well.

", "Ken Spitler", "", "We measure it all the ways but what I was referring to there typically when we talk about productivity we talk about how we  get a case out of the warehouse and transport it to a customer. So it would be the people that are directly involved in that which would be occupancy, transportation and warehouse.

How is that productivity increase being driven? ", "Ken Spitler", "", "It actually has been several initiatives we have had out. One we have talked about many times, going from double jacks to triple jacks which simply means that when we pass through the warehouse we have three pallet positions on a piece of equipment where we had two. That allows us less travel time. When you are talking about warehouse productivity there are several things you are looking at. The big thing is and a big area we have been watching is just the travel time. So if you can cut a trip through the warehouse to select orders, cut several minutes off of that and start multiplying those minutes times thousands times hundreds of thousands times millions it starts to really make a big difference. Of course, when you reduce the number miles that you drive you have got more time at the customer\u2019s back door; your productivity goes up there also. So this is all operationally driven if that is the question. ", "Richard Schnieders", "", "It is not a new computer system. It is really a new process so they are systems but they are human systems. They are new processes within the warehouse and transportation. ", "Ken Spitler", "", "Part of it goes back to 5-6 years ago we started redesigning our warehouses strictly to be more productive.

Just in terms of the double to triple jacks and it sounds like maybe you are changing how you pick to be more efficient, in terms of the whole U.S. system or include Canada, whatever, where are you at in that so we can get a sense of there are three more quarters of productivity here or are we at the end or barely scratched the surface? On the things you just identified in particular. ", "Ken Spitler", "", "I think we are beyond barely scratching the surface here but we certainly\u2026you don\u2019t just go out and change out all your equipment overnight from doubles to triples because that is a fairly significant capital expenditure so we have been doing it over time.

So I guess my question is it seems to be working quite well frankly on reducing your cost structure through some of the things we have been discussing but if I recall there was an idea you might use price as a lever to gain market share. Perhaps you are doing that. Could you just speak to that and whether you think\u2026are you doing it somewhat and do you think the environment for that type of an approach where you actually could see if you led with price more so than SYSCO has in the past then you could get some of the customers you have been wanting to get for awhile.

We have been very pleased with our ability and again I\u2019ll take my hat off to the operating companies, our ability to manage those gross margins. But we have also said in the past there is a lot of stickiness in this business. You can\u2019t just go out and wholesale reduce a bunch of prices and expect to gain five points of market share. It is, as I said before, very surgical. So we have to be careful and we have to be smart about it. It is not going to drive 5% market share gains in a short period of time. So, it is just kind of paying attention to the many things we have to pay attention to in a business that appears to be pretty straightforward but in the end has a great deal of complexity to it.

I\u2019m not going to sit here and say we have got a huge backlog of deals but we are working on more deals today than we were a year ago. I feel like we will see more of that just because of the reality of what I think we alluded to earlier in the call. It is a very difficult environment to borrow money in. First of all to grow your business and second of all if you are highly levered folks are going to run into some challenges. We thought we\u2019d see this quite honestly a year ago when things turned in the markets and what has been going on here in the last two months I think is different and deeper and we would expect to see more opportunities going forward.

You guys have done a lot to mitigate the rising costs and the real sales impact has not been as much to offset what you have gotten on a gross profit dollar per unit basis. So, I\u2019m just curious in this environment if suddenly we fell into a deflationary situation where prices were flat to down how do you think that would play out on a gross profit dollar per unit and gross profit dollar growth basis? ", "Richard Schnieders", "", "I think first of all we have been in deflationary periods before and I would say that we have done a very good job. We have got a lot of experience. In fact we already have a heads up to our operating companies in terms of reminding them what to do when you have a category or sub-category of products that is deflationary. So they are very tuned in to it and I think very experienced. What will happen, or what has happened in the past, is we will see a little bit on a percentage basis you will see a little more pressure in the expense line but we will pick up on the gross margin line. Those are pretty much in balance if you will. If you look at inflation or deflation, we don\u2019t give ourselves anything for picking up at the gross margin line or expense line now. What we do give ourselves credit for, as Ken talked about a minute ago, is being able to improve our productivity in any environment. That is where we are getting our real leverage. We are not counting on it from inflation or deflation. ", "Ken Spitler", "", "This is just a matter of opinion, but I think our systems are better at handling deflation than they are inflation.

Your systems and scale advantage and RDC\u2019s, etc. I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a handle on the current environment we are in where traffic through away from home consumption is so depressed right now and you guys are at an advantage taking share and what have you. I hate to paint a negative picture, but if inflation is actually giving you guys an opportunity in terms of sourcing or what have you to take share because you are able to out price or under price as need be, is there an issue with deflation coupled with potentially a negative traffic scenario for the industry where there is a gross profit dollar issue. ", "Bill DeLaney", "", "That is one of those great questions where probably there is not one answer to it. I think the way you initially posed the question you used the word suddenly. I think if there was a sudden, deflationary spiral that would create highly unusual pressures that I don\u2019t know if we have ever seen in this industry from where we are at right now. With that said, what would be a better environment for our customers and us would be a lessening of inflation and we would expect that would be a more likely scenario. The challenge in this market, I guess from what I see, and I don\u2019t have quite as many years as Rick and Ken do in the business, but I saw some other earnings releases over the last week or two if we were just in a recession right now that would be one thing but what is going on in the environment is much broader than that. It is very psychological. The financial markets are weighing on people. So I don\u2019t know if you can just talk about inflation and deflation or a recession in isolation. I think you have to look at it in terms of other ramifications. So if there was a significant lessening of inflation and that somehow got the consumer to feel better about their pocketbook then that might be some offsetting positives for that. With respect to return to traffic at our customers and I\u2019ll end where I started. I think the pace of this would be pretty important. If it happened gradually I think that would be a better scenario. ", "Richard Schnieders", "", "I think the other thing to keep in mind is that we again in comparison to our competition think we are much better positioned than our competition to deal with the swings in pricing. I would also go back to, because I think you suggested that inflation was helping us with share gain, and I\u2019m not sure that is what we are hanging our hat on in terms of share gain. Our share gain, we believe, is primarily coming from more fundamental activities and initiatives we have out there. Specifically again, business reviews. Business reviews and our go to market strategy unrelated, uncoupled to inflation is really the way we grow share.

We talked about it a little bit at the end of the last quarter and actually at that time we estimated an increase for the six months of $55-65 million. So we have brought that down primarily because as I said we are still buying about 1/3 of it spot and obviously prices have come off a lot. We think when the six months is over $40-50 million is a pretty good ballpark. We expect to recover most of that on the fuel surcharges.

I think some of that is being fueled by the reality that the major retailers, major and a good regional grocery retailers, have done a nice job over the last few years at improving their take out offerings. Now having said that, we are not abdicating that space. We have a good program with a number of regional players out there and larger players where we provide them ingredients for their take out business. The ingredients, packaging and that sort of thing.

They have to have the ability for the customer to enter their order via the Internet and all those components. They have to have the marketing program.

The pension quarterly performance you saw for the pension you can pretty much annualize that comparison to last year in terms of the company\u2019s qualified pension plan.

We still do need to tweak that a little bit here as we issue options here later in November and December. So that is not quite as hard a number but it should be pretty close. The multi-employer plan will fluctuate. What you saw this quarter was we didn\u2019t have any situations where we needed to set up provisions for multi-employer plan liabilities. A year ago we did.

It is just one of those processes that is going to take some time to work through it appropriately. It is moving in the right direction. It is going to take some more time. We feel very good with our position. ", "Operator", "", "The final question is a follow-up question from Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital. ", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Back to the COLI situation, have you guys thought about eliminating or finding some other way to do this? I know other companies that had COLI and it created unnecessary volatility in earnings. ", "Richard Schnieders", "", "Yes every day we think about it. It is very volatile right now. In a certain way we have addressed it in terms of the plans that particular investment underwrites or supports, even though it technically doesn\u2019t support it on the accounting side, but those contracts are out there to support supplemental retirement benefits for our senior leadership. We have actually cut back on the formula in those plans and we have also pared back the future eligibility for those plans. So over the longer term we have done some things. In the shorter term there is still some pretty viable tax reasons to fund it the way we do and unfortunately the accounting requires you to essentially mark it mark to market which probably isn\u2019t technically right but essentially the same. So, it is a trade off between the volatility and the tax benefits and as much as we would like to lessen the volatility at this point we are planning on staying the course. ", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I have a question about labor costs. You improved productivity, management did take a pay cut I think starting July 1. Were there cuts in other employee pay? Did commissions for marketing reps go down? ", "Bill DeLaney", "", "No. ", "Richard Schnieders", "", "I think the only thing we did there was obviously when you have the kind of inflation we have seen I think our folks have looked at their commission programs and make sure they are appropriate but there have been no direct cuts. ", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "About credit, I know you haven\u2019t seen a lot of restaurants go out of business but do you feel comfortable with the way the operating companies are dealing with their credit customers? ", "Richard Schnieders", "", "Comfortable and credit aren\u2019t two words you usually use together a lot in our business but yes, we would reiterate what we have said all along. We feel we do a good job managing credit and obviously most of that is done at a local level as all of our business tends to be local to a large extent. So we feel good about how we are managing it but clearly these economic times are providing challenges and there are situations where people are going out of business. There are situations where we are having to work with folks on payment plans and so we have said from the beginning we would expect credit to be more of a lagging indicator and I would stand by that. We definitely feel we are managing it well. ", "Operator", "", "At this time for closing remarks I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Richard Schnieders.

Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "Lastly, we ask that you reserve December 14 through 15 on your calendars for a potential analysts day in New York. More information will be forthcoming from my office in the coming weeks.", "With that out of the way, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney III", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning Sysco reported net earnings of $315 million for the fourth quarter and nearly $1.1 billion for fiscal 2009. These results were generated through the consistent support of our customers and the dedicated efforts of our associates in the midst of the most difficult business environment that our industry has ever experienced.", "While financial performance in general does not reflect the type of year-over-year improvement that Sysco typically produces, we are pleased both with the absolute results and our operating company\u2019s ability to compete successfully by providing excellent service and business solutions to their customers. We\u2019re particularly encouraged by our ability to manage costs effectively throughout our organization in a year when revenues declined for the first time in Sysco\u2019s history. Ken will address this aspect of our operating performance in more detail in just a minute.", "In addition to controlling costs well, we also generated strong cash flow from operations for the year and enhanced our liquidity by securing $500 million in long term financing. As a result, we were able to invest appropriately in capital projects, modestly increase our acquisition activity over the prior year, and return a large portion of our free cash flow to shareholders. ", "For now I\u2019ll turn it over to Ken for a discussion on operational results, and then I\u2019ll come back to provide further detail on our financial results. Ken?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "", "Thanks, Bill. Overall I\u2019m pleased with the operational results we achieved during last year. For 2009 we sold $37 billion of product, generated $1.9 million of operating income, produced cash flow from operations of $1.6 billion and returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders. Without question, 2009 represented the most challenging sales year we\u2019ve had in Sysco\u2019s 40 year history. However, as has always been Sysco\u2019s focus, our dedicated associates remain committed to serving our customers.", "Our cost control efforts have not only helped support operating earnings, but have positioned us well for when the economy begins to recover. The key to our success has been improving operational efficiency, and I\u2019m pleased with how our operations continue to perform. For example, in our broad line companies during 2009 our diesel gallon usage decreased 7% compared to a mileage decrease of 5%. Kilowatt hours decreased 7%. Cases per trip increased 2%. Warehouse cases per man hour improved 4% and total sales per employee increased approximately 5%.", "Capital expenditures for 2009 totaled $465 million. Looking ahead, we remain committed to continuing to invest in our business so as to leverage our leadership position and profitably gain market share. As a result, I expect capital spending for the next year to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. This spending will be relatively balanced between maintenance items such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs, and growth items such as expansions of current facilities and potential fold-outs. ", "Also included in this amount is technology, a significant portion of which is dedicated to our ongoing ERP project. With the ERP project, we are taking the opportunity to review many of our processes and finding ways to further streamline our operation. It\u2019s important to note that this project is about a lot more than technology. In the end, the technology is an enabler for what we are designing, which is a business transformation. We have signed a contract with SAP and continue to make progress on the design of our new technology platform. We expect to have design work completed by the end of calendar year and will provide a comprehensive update on the project at the analysts\u2019 day in December that Neil mentioned earlier.", "The results of 2009 are also representative of our commitment to managing costs across the organization. Our headcount is down approximately 6% year-over-year as we\u2019ve improved productivity throughout the year. Expense levels also reflect our pay for performance culture, as bonuses and commissions were down substantially year-over-year.", "We are confident that the steps we\u2019ve taken to date will better position us to fully participate to the extent economic recovery occurs during fiscal 2010. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of our associates for their continued hard work to support our customers.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill for a discussion of our financial results for the quarter and for the year.", "William J. DeLaney III", " ", "Thank you, Ken. The sales decline of 6.6% in the fourth quarter reflects an ongoing reduction in volume, as well as nearly three points less of inflation than what we experienced in the third quarter. We believe that the two year plus trend of approximately 6% annualized inflation has now reversed, and that we are currently experiencing modest levels of deflation in the early weeks of fiscal 2010. In addition, the impact of acquisitions increased sales by 0.6% in the fourth quarter while the weakening of the Canadian dollar reduced sales by 1.3% in the quarter.", "As Ken pointed out in his comments, we managed expenses very well throughout the year. However, we should note that the favorable performance of Cole investments contributed $0.03 per share to our fourth quarter results. Conversely for the year, unfavorable Cole investment performance reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.06 when compared to the prior year.", "Our working capital management improved modestly during fiscal 2009. We\u2019re especially pleased with our ability to improve accounts receivable days outstanding from the prior year. Nevertheless, many of our customers were impacted by today\u2019s cash flow pressures, which resulted in our bad debt expense more than doubling to $74 million for the year. While significantly higher than our expense levels in normal times, this represents just 0.2% of annualized sales. We expect credit management will remain a formidable challenge again in fiscal 2010.", "As we begin the new fiscal year, we are encouraged by the cautious optimism that appears to be building regarding the economy\u2019s prospects for improvement in the coming months. With that said, the likely pace and extent of such improvement remains unclear. Sysco\u2019s sales comparisons will be particularly challenging early in the fiscal year since we experienced 5% sales growth with 8% inflation in the first quarter of 2009. Sales trends should improve subsequent to the first quarter, assuming the anticipated gradual pickup in underlying economic conditions materializes.", "Supporting our customers and enhancing productivity in all aspects of our business will remain top priorities in fiscal 2010. While we are hopeful that market conditions will improve as we approach the new calendar year, we are also confident that our industry leadership position and financial strength will permit us to successfully navigate a less favorable economic scenario. Furthermore, we will continue to invest in our business so that we are well positioned to capitalize on those attractive market opportunities that present themselves in the years to come.", "With that, operator, we\u2019ll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "", "I wanted to get a little more update on the operating environment heading into the first quarter here. If you look at the Navtrak trends, they were certainly worse for July than what we saw in the June quarter. Just talk about maybe the contrast between how the change you\u2019re doing versus your street accounts.", "William J. DeLaney III", "Good morning, Mark. This is Bill. I\u2019ll let Ken jump into this as well. I would say to you that in terms of what we\u2019re seeing, just on pure volume, if you look at cases which we don\u2019t specifically disclose the rate of decline in cases is about what it\u2019s been the last quarter or so. It certainly didn\u2019t pick up in July but I can tell you that it\u2019s gotten a whole lot worse in terms of volume. But we are fighting the deflation more so now than we were in the fourth quarter, so in terms of top line there is more pressure there. Ken?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Yes, that\u2019s about right. We\u2019re seeing that things are, I guess calming down a bit. Probably as best as I can say it a little more optimistic at this point than I have been in the last few months.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "", "And maybe just to dovetail onto that, how do you think about the sustainability of the controlling the operating expenses throughout the year? Obviously halfway through the year you\u2019ve still got an opportunity, but the second half you\u2019ll start lapping some of the controls you\u2019ve put in for 2009.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", " ", "Yes, we\u2019ve still got room to keep maintaining that and our business in a lot of ways is a one-to-one ratio based on the cases crossing the docks. You know there reaches a point where that doesn\u2019t become practical, but we haven\u2019t reached that yet.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams.", "Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams", "Sales in the quarter were down about 6.5% and gross profit dollars were down a little bit worse, north of 7. And I think that spread was consistent with the third quarter. Can you just talk about what\u2019s happening there? Is it just the less inflation and are there some mixed changes that are exacerbating it?", "William J. DeLaney III", "Well actually we\u2019re kind of pleased with how we\u2019re hanging in there on the gross profit, to be honest with you, Simeon. You don\u2019t see all of this, but in the broad line business we\u2019re pretty much holding our own on the margins. Some of the specialty companies, you know, SYGMA, you know had a nice year and a nice quarter so their margins are off a little bit but their profits are up substantially. So all in all I think we\u2019re holding margins pretty well. The customer mix with the change growing somewhat faster than the street does put some pressure on the margin as well as you point out, but, Ken, do you want to add anything to that?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Yes. We are pretty happy with holding onto the margins as we have. You know some of this is also, there\u2019s some pretty large deflationary in some areas that are affecting those margins also.", "Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams", "", "And I guess related to that, you know we talked about last quarter the idea of being or getting more aggressive on pricing, maybe to accelerate market share gain. And I think you expressed, you know, not going to do that, that\u2019s not really the philosophy of the business. And I was curious if there ever comes a point where that does make sense, if real growth just stays negative for an extended period of time? And then secondarily are you seeing any of your competitors starting to do that?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", " ", "Yes, we are. There is a lot of competitive pressure out there based on price, and we\u2019d be willing to do that if it worked. Unfortunately, lowering your price doesn\u2019t always equal a gain in market share. Now we have, that\u2019s not to say that we haven\u2019t taken a competitive posture. We have. We really have taken a posture that we will not lose any business based on the competitive pressures from price. But again, that\u2019s not our offensive posture because producing the lowest price doesn\u2019t guarantee market share. At some point would we ever let loose on all the cannons? It\u2019d have to get pretty tough for us to do that.", "William J. DeLaney III", "Again, Simeon, I think the key to look at this in terms of how our folks run their businesses out there is at the customer level. So to Ken\u2019s point, it\u2019s very, very competitive out there right now, as much as it\u2019s ever been. And certainly where there\u2019s risk of losing significant business or deteriorating a relationship we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re as competitive as anyone out there. With that said, you know, what we\u2019ve tried to say over the last couple of years is just to take a broad brush approach to reducing price. You know as the industry leader we don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly good for us or for the industry.", "Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams", "", "And then lastly, you know, on that topic of expenses in terms of maybe having some more room to cut if need be, just kind of flip that around for a second. You know if demand does start to pick up here, you know, have you had any thoughts and I guess maybe it is on the pace of a pickup, you know, how quickly in this environment then you would sort of, you know, rehire and reflex the model upwards? I\u2019m just curious on how kind of the leverage will work on the other side. You know is there a bigger opportunity now maybe to hire at a faster rate and take more share given the unprecedented decline in demand? Or is it sort of the normal curve out of this cycle?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Well, I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re asking there, but I\u2019ll answer it as best I can. I think that hiring right now is, we are making an effort to maintain our marketing associate positioning so that we are positioned to take advantage of any economic upturn. What we\u2019d need to do would be to hire operational employees which are predominantly warehouse and transportation people. We\u2019re finding that relatively easy to do today, so we could ramp up very fast. And of course we still have plenty of capacity in our ability with the marketing associates to take on more sales. So you know one of the things that we\u2019ve done in this economic downturn is continue to be prepared for the eventual turnaround. And we\u2019re ready for that to happen right now, by the way.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company.", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company", "", "I know you guys aren\u2019t giving guidance and I don\u2019t expect that, but I\u2019m just curious what broader financial targets you guys are holding yourselves accountable to, either over the medium term or over the long term.", "William J. DeLaney III", "Well, Jay, it\u2019s Bill. As you said we\u2019re not giving long term guidance at this point in time, and I still think that that\u2019s probably an appropriate stance to take. We\u2019ve got a lot of things that we\u2019re working on here right now, so obviously in the short term as we said, you know, we\u2019re out there staying close to our customers, sweating it out and trying to perform as best we can and make sure our customers are well positioned to A, survive and B, grow from there. As Ken alluded to his comments this ERP project is a more medium term oriented opportunity for us and we\u2019re going to talk to you a lot more about that toward the tail end of the calendar year when we\u2019ve had a chance to go through the design phase and share our thoughts with our board and all that type of thing. So you know I think I\u2019d like to defer any longer term projections or guidance until A, we see a little more stability in the economy and B, and we\u2019ve had a chance to continue to develop our thoughts. ", "But in the short term, you know, we\u2019re looking at this year. By the way, just as an administrative point, this is a 53 week year for us. But if you look at it 52 to 52 I\u2019m talking about 2010. We have a very modest plan for growth this year and it\u2019s going to have to be somewhat back end loaded. We\u2019re going to have to see some improvement in the economy and to Ken\u2019s point in terms of our tack that we\u2019re taking on headcount, we\u2019re going to continue to examine all the work that we do, all the activities that we perform and adjust headcount accordingly as we go through this and manage our expenses. With that said, on the sales and marketing side we\u2019re going to be a little bit more focused on maintaining and potentially growing those numbers as well. Because you do require some lead time there. So we\u2019re hoping to put up some [high] stroke numbers for the new year, but again it\u2019s going to be somewhat of a function of how the economy performs. But we\u2019ll continue to manage expenses well.", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company", "", "Do you have any specific initiatives and/or targets within your sales and marketing initiatives that are different this year versus last year to try to drive those cases?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Yes. We have our own stimulus package working right now, and it\u2019s directed at moving really commodity type cases across our dock. So, you know in an effort to help our customers and an effort to help ourselves.", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company", "", "The economy aside and any variations there, what do you think changes the most in the next 12 months particularly within the controllables of your business?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Could you say that again?", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company", "", "Take the economy variations aside, you know, what do you think could change the most within the next 12 months within the core part of your business, especially on the controllables?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "What could change?", "William J. DeLaney III", "I don\u2019t think a lot, Jay. That\u2019s a huge caveat. I think really the economy, and specifically what its impact is on the consumer and their confidence level and willingness to spend. Our belief continues to be, you know, like it\u2019s been for years and even though we\u2019re seeing some slowing and growth rates within our industry which you know are well documented. We\u2019ve certainly talked about, you know, going out to eat is still a fairly low price ticket or low cost item for most American families. So while we\u2019re certainly participating in this situation right now, we do think that as the economy improves and as people get more comfortable with that they\u2019ve got a job and they\u2019re going to, you know, not have their pay cut too much next year, you know, going back out to eat. And the margin is a lot less expensive than buying a car, buying a house, or those types of things. That is a meaningful swing factor for us as we go through the year.", "And to Ken\u2019s earlier point, if we get just a little bit of a pick up we\u2019re very well positioned right now to leverage that.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", " ", "Jay, he one thing that we don\u2019t want to see escalate is [audio impairment] the fuel price. It has a bad effect on our customers and a bad effect on us. So we\u2019d love to see the fuel, diesel, gasoline prices down a bit more and stabilize there.", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research Company", "", "Right before I sign off, any update on the CFO search?", "William J. DeLaney III", "Yes, we\u2019re searching. Jay, we\u2019re obviously taking it very serious and we\u2019re fortunate to have some strong people we\u2019re looking at both internally and externally. And I expect it would take several months and we\u2019re still in the midst of it, but we\u2019ll hopefully have an announcement for you in the next couple of months.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", " ", "You were talking just now about fuel costs. Can you comment at all about what happened with fuel expense this quarter? The actual expense on the income statement versus the prior year?", "William J. DeLaney III", "Yes we can, and I\u2019m going to start with round numbers and we can go from there, Meredith. We\u2019ll have all that for you in the K but the fuel expense actually was down, you know, for the quarter as we projected it would be. But then we didn\u2019t have the fuel surcharges last year that we had so if you were to net the two together, you know, the net fuel impact probably hurt us a little bit, maybe by about $0.01. But in terms of pure expense it was down.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "", "And then maybe you could just talk a little bit about CapEx. It was pretty low this year, certainly lower than you had anticipated. Could you just talk a little bit about how you invested it this year? And is there any chance of getting buckets for next year? Did you say it\u2019s about 50-50 for maintenance type items and then other stuff? Is that the right way to think of the coming year?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Yes. You know this year and next year look about the same. We continue to purchase and take old trucks out of our fleet and bringing on new trucks. So that\u2019s just, we have guidelines there, certain years and certain amount of mileages when we move those trucks on. So every year those kind of costs are about the same. And every year you want to continue to do that or there\u2019s a bubble year that\u2019s bad for you. So that expense remains the same.", "Usually when you see these fluctuations, it\u2019s in the timing of how we\u2019ve spent money in terms of new facilities or in construction, meaningful construction on existing facilities. So sometimes those dollars run from one year to the next. So the big fluctuation between what we spent this year, which was down mostly because we did not, almost all of it was in a building that we were going to build and then we did not like the location and the cost of getting the ground ready. So we stopped that and moved the location which, for your information, was Philadelphia and it was going to cost us too much to get the land ready so we moved it. So that fluctuation that you see this year and caused a great deal of the cost to go down.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "", "What about the RDCs? What\u2019s the plan for that?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Well we\u2019re looking. Of course the RDCs as we\u2019ve said many times depend on you know a certain amount of cases going across that. And right now the lower case movement does not dictate for us to go forward with the one in the Midwest. However, we\u2019ll be taking a close look at that in September. That\u2019s our decision month for that. If we see some positive signs in the economy, the design is ready, then we go out to bid the contract. We\u2019re still prepared to do that, but again we need positive cases to make that work the way we want it.", "William J. DeLaney III", " ", "[Inaudible] Meredith and we\u2019re tap dancing here a little bit with you. I know the last couple of years we haven\u2019t spent what we thought, and Ken took you through examples of why that happens. We\u2019re more optimistic I guess, if that\u2019s the right word, that we will spend the $600 million this year because I\u2019m not going to get into buckets with you today, but a meaningful piece of that number would be on the technology side. It\u2019s just we\u2019re kind of in an awkward situation now where we\u2019re still going through the design phase and obviously there\u2019s an internal approval process. So I do think as we get deeper into the year we might be able to give you a little bit more color commentary on the components of the CapEx.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "", "And then my final question, with the bad debt number that you mentioned clearly there are closures of restaurants. Do you have any insight into whether there is a reduction in the capacity on the distribution side? Are the distributors, smaller distributors going out of business at a faster pace than in the past?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "No we haven\u2019t seen that. Really we\u2019re pretty up to speed on all of those closures and there\u2019s only been a couple. I can\u2019t say what this year will bring, but certainly as in the past that has not occurred.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "", "It sounds like you do think when we round the horn on the consumer hitting the wall that we\u2019ll see some type of growth in real volume cases, probably as we get towards year end. Is that fair?", "William J. DeLaney III", "Well we\u2019re certainly hopeful, John. I mean we\u2019ve crafted this presentation today in a very balanced way so, you know we\u2019ve got some tough comparisons here in the fourth quarter that we just completed and the first. We need a little bit of a pick up to see that, but certainly our plan is predicated on the conditions improving as we get toward the calendar year.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "", "Because this is uncharted territory for everybody, what happens if you get, if you cycle those kind of mid single digit declines in cases, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to decline additionally off that but let\u2019s say, you know, volumes are instead kind of flat and they end up being flat for a little while. What do you do if anything? And is there, I guess there\u2019s room on the cost side to cut a little more if you had to to offset that. Is that fair?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "That\u2019s fair. That\u2019s about right.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "", "How do you sort of? I mean it\u2019s got to be very difficult to put a budget together in this environment because its\u2019 not clear whether there\u2019s going to be 2% growth or 4 or 0, right, when you cycle October and November of this year.", "William J. DeLaney III", "Yes. No, it\u2019s difficult. The good news, John, is we have a lot of practice at putting together aggressive budgets and then, you know, managing if things don\u2019t go quite as well as what we would like. So this year was different. We took a more deliberate approach. We got more people involved, not just at the [outco] but even here in terms of, you know, [sani] checks and running different scenarios. And so you\u2019re always balancing in terms of the internal part of this wanting to maximize what you can do with the reality that, you know, you don\u2019t control all of the factors either. So the spirit of our budget is we\u2019re going to go out and try to make a number. And we\u2019ve got to get a little bit of growth and a little bit of help to do that. ", "As we said a couple of times now, if we get just a little bit of case growth as the year goes along we\u2019re well positioned. There\u2019s some of these unusual items that we speak to, it might be a good time for me to just remind you where we are in some of that. So you know you want to make sure you understand. Obviously we have that table we put in each earnings period just to kind of identify the items that we think are somewhat volatile and in the short term items that we don\u2019t really control or have the ability to impact that much. So the Cole clearly hurt us this year. If the markets were to be flat even that would help us next year. With that said, pension probably will be up about $40 million and we\u2019ll have a more fine tuned number for you as we draft the K. Stock comp could be up a little bit, $5 to $10 million you know because we\u2019ve got a restricted stock plan that\u2019s going in. That type of thing. ", "The multi-employer number, you know if we don\u2019t have any more situations like we\u2019ve had the last couple of years that could help us by about $10 million or so. So that and the Cole are hard to predict. We\u2019ve got some headwinds on pension, in particular. Fuel should help us, in particular the second half of the year, a couple pennies, maybe three. The net in the first half shouldn\u2019t be that significant. So that\u2019s a long way of saying, John, you know bad debt we think will be tough again this year. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll be any worse but, you know we took a big hit this year. And the long way of saying that a lot of that stuff for now in terms of the plan, you know we documented it. We\u2019re going to kind of presume that it roughly offsets, and we\u2019ve got to go out and grow some cases this year goes along.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Well, keep in mind too, John, that we produced a weekly P&L through last year and to plan. So I mean we run our business very tightly and we run it on a weekly basis. Whenever we see trends that are favorable or unfavorable, we\u2019re on a week-to-week basis to be able to react to it.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "", "Your CapEx number does not include any acquisitions I assume.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "No.", "William J. DeLaney III", "Correct.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "", "I mean there\u2019s no bucket in there for, just kind of the place holders, so that would be incremental.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Yes.", "William J. DeLaney III", "Right.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "", "What\u2019s the thought on use of free cash now? Because it looks like, you know, build cash on the balance sheet, use it for acquisitions, you know and maybe get ready to pay down some debt down the road. But what\u2019s the thought process on using the cash that you have?", "William J. DeLaney III", "Well I think admittedly, you know, over the last eight to ten months we\u2019ve certainly wanted to make sure that we had enough cash and more than ample access to debt, if conditions continued to deteriorate or some contingency manifest itself that we needed to deal with. So we\u2019ve been I guess erring if you will on the side of conservatism here. And we feel like that certainly has been the right approach. So at this point we\u2019re hoping to continue to see some opportunities in acquisitions. We\u2019re not seeing a lot as we speak, but we\u2019re certainly being as proactive as we can there. Like we said earlier, the CapEx budget I think will probably approach the $600 million, maybe a little bit more this year. ", "And then you\u2019ve seen us pull back on the share repurchase program. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us be real active there in the next couple of quarters anyway, John, you know until we see how things kind of settle out in the economy. And then obviously later in the year we\u2019ll be talking with our board about the dividend.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "", "Do you think we finally get the IRS thing settled this fiscal year or no?", "William J. DeLaney III", "We\u2019re working really hard at it and we\u2019re having some productive discussions. And I\u2019ll tell you, John, as soon as we know, we\u2019ll be happy to tell you about it. I feel better about the progress than I did a year ago.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup.", "[Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Just a question on market share. Do you think you\u2019re gaining share on a unit basis or is it sort of hard to [inaudible]?", "William J. DeLaney III", "Are we gaining share? Is that the question, Al? ", "[Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "That\u2019s right. ", "William J. DeLaney III", "Yes. I think maybe the honest answer is any time in the short term it\u2019s hard to tell. We certainly think we\u2019re holding our own out there. It\u2019s a slippery slope right now. There\u2019s some business out there that isn\u2019t necessarily great business. It brings with it higher risk and our folks are pretty good at sorting through that. So we certainly feel we\u2019re holding our own and we\u2019ll probably be better able to tell you more about that as the year goes along and we see some more updated industry numbers. But I think the industry conditions right now are a little bit tougher than what some of the early projections were, you know, coming out of Technomic and people like that.", "[Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "And then just a follow up on the competitive environment, you know, has it become more promotional this quarter versus last quarter? And also have there been any changes in July?", "William J. DeLaney III", " ", "Yes. We are increasing our promotional. We have our own stimulus package going on for our operating companies that\u2019s a little bit different than July.", "[Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "And then assuming there\u2019s no change in the cost of commodities, would you expect the inflation trends you saw this quarter to continue [inaudible]?", "William J. DeLaney III", " ", "The what trends?", "[Alvin] for Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Inflation.", "William J. DeLaney III", " ", "Inflation? Yes, that\u2019s a harder call. Like I said in my comments, you know we\u2019re seeing some modest deflation right now, in particular in the dairy category. I mean it\u2019s down almost 20% from what we\u2019re looking at right now. So we would, we think that will subside to some extent and that would help us a little bit. But I\u2019d say for now we expect to see some pricing pressure.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "That\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing from the industry.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "", "If you could comment with what you\u2019re seeing in terms of rate of openings and rate of closures in the industry, you know if the current quarter is static relative to what it was in the last quarter? I mean where they\u2019re actually seeing an acceleration in closures? Whatever  you\u2019re seeing on the local level.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Yes, that\u2019s really pretty difficult to answer. You know I wouldn\u2019t say that we are having some restaurant openings that we haven\u2019t seen in probably the past three months, but really that\u2019s incidental. I would say that I feel better about the industry than I did three months ago and that we\u2019re seeing positive signs. And I want to qualify that by saying maybe I\u2019m just looking for positive signs, but I am feeling much better about that, the industry as a whole.", "William J. DeLaney III", "I think that, just to add on that, I mean we\u2019ve said this before and I don\u2019t mean to be trite but you know we are somewhat encouraged right now that more and more people are encouraged. And you know a lot of this is somewhat psychological in terms of the consumer as well as the restaurateurs and the feedback we\u2019re getting is people are increasingly optimistic generally. At the same time some of the restaurateurs are still struggling with volume and that type of thing. So anything we would give you on openings and closings, I think would be somewhat anecdotal right now. But the underlying sentiment seems to be a little bit more favorable right now.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "", "And maybe it\u2019s an observation but it\u2019s also a question. I think the questions people have been asking on this call has been related to restaurant trends even over the last six weeks. Because so much of what we\u2019ve been hearing coming out of the casual dining companies, the quick service companies is actually a pretty marked slowdown from May to June and July. But broadly across your businesses I mean is that something you\u2019re just not seeing? Because I mean a lot of us are trying to struggle in terms of if its happening in the chains, why that wouldn\u2019t be happening with independents?", "William J. DeLaney III", "No, I mean we\u2019re seeing it. I think what we\u2019re saying is I don\u2019t know that our filtering process is that good from one month to the next. And we\u2019ve been seeing quite a bit of it since March, April and May. And I think all we\u2019re saying is June and July we certainly didn\u2019t see a rebound, but I can\u2019t sit here and tell you that the falloff was any worse in July than it was in June, if you look at cases. The challenge is the pricing.", "And the other thing obviously to keep in mind here, John, is our business mix which is about 63, 65% restaurants. And a good portion of it is healthcare and colleges and universities. So maybe that\u2019s buffering it for us a little bit right now.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "", "And finally, and I\u2019m sorry if this point just got over me, what stimulus package that you have for your operating companies? I mean, can you go with me? What exactly is that?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "It\u2019s just something that we named that and we named it The Stimulus Package. It\u2019s just promotion. We\u2019re just promoting some products on a regular basis throughout the [Opco\u2019s] driving it from here.", "William J. DeLaney III", "We didn\u2019t get any TARP money or anything.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "", "You\u2019re offering products at lower prices than what you normally would is your [inaudible].", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Yes. That\u2019s the size of it. I don\u2019t mean to give you the impression that it\u2019s a really big deal. It\u2019s just something a little different. We just are trying to stimulate some sales growth and took off on our President.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robert Cummins - Shields & Company.", "Robert Cummins - Shields & Company", "", "It seems to me that undoubtedly you\u2019re doing a lot better currently despite the difficult conditions than most of your smaller competitors around the country. And you mentioned very briefly a little while ago acquisitions. I\u2019d like to just follow up on that and see if you\u2019re taking a more proactive view toward buying people up in this environment? Or are you leery about doing that for fear of problems you might find? What\u2019s your general approach there at a time when it would seem there must be a lot of distribution businesses for sale?", "William J. DeLaney III", "Morning, Bob. Proactive is the right word and certainly we are being proactive. It\u2019s a mixed bag right now. We get a lot of calls and we work through all of them. And we\u2019re calling people where it makes sense and that type of thing. The reality is, at least from my take, is we\u2019re not seeing I guess what I would call realistic expectations as much as what we might like to see. And generally, you know, there\u2019s two types of sellers. One is a seller that if they get the right price and they run a really good business, then they\u2019re open to selling. The other is the type that has some catalyst that\u2019s bringing them to the table, either a family situation or a capital structure situation, that type of thing. So where the folks have capital structure issues, there\u2019s a little more interest there and part of our challenge there is to get to them before they do go out of business. And the other folks where they\u2019re running good businesses, this probably isn\u2019t the best environment to be selling a business. So it\u2019s somewhat of a mixed bag, but I can assure you we\u2019re being very proactive. Ken?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Bob, we\u2019ll continue to run our traps. There\u2019s just not much in them.", "Robert Cummins - Shields & Company", "", "Just a quick follow up. Was there any contribution from acquisitions, either in your quarter or fiscal year numbers?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Small.", "William J. DeLaney III", ".", "Yes, a little bit for the quarter. The 0.06% on the sales line. It was negligible for the year.", "Operator", "", "That concludes the question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.  At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President Investor Relations.", "", "Neil A. Russell", "Thank you for joining us for Sysco's First Quarter 2010 conference call.  On today's call you will hear from Bill DeLaney our Chief Executive Officer, Ken Spitler our Vice President, Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and Chris Kreidler our Chief Financial Officer.

", "Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted.  Lastly, we've distributed invitations for our Investor Day which will be held on December 14 in New York.  If you did not receive an invitation and would like to attend, please call my office for more information.  ", "With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney. ", "William J. DeLaney III ", "Earlier this morning, Sysco reported net earnings of $326 million for the first fiscal quarter of the year.  Sales continue to be under pressure declined by 8%, due to both lower volumes and the impact of food cost deflation.  Despite these challenging conditions, we were able to improve our operating margins to 5.5% as a result of excellent cost control, as well as a benefit from COLI, both of which we will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.  ", "At Sysco, we constantly strive for continuous improvement, by focusing on strengthening our customer relationships and improving productivity in all aspects of our business we've been able to compete effectively throughout this economic downturn.  Most important, we believe we are well positioned for profitable growth when industry conditions begin to improve.  ", "Regarding the economy, we are hopeful that some of the promising signs and sentiments that are beginning to materialize will soon result in increased consumer spending.  That, together with the moderation of deflation, would be favorable developments for Sysco.  ", "In the interim, we are encouraged by the fact that the rate of decline in our case volumes has stabilized in recent weeks.  We will continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic outlook and will remain vigilant in our efforts to manage the business responsibly during this period of economic uncertainty.  ", "Specifically, we remain committed to exceeding the expectations of our customers through our relentless commitment to product and service quality, investing in our business to improve productivity, enhance profitability and grow market share, and maintaining balance sheet strength through strong operating cash flow generation and sound asset management.  ", "Before I turn the call over to Ken, I would like to recognize all of our associates and our management team for their outstanding contributions over the past year.  I also want to welcome Chris Kreidler, our new CFO.  Chris is an important addition to the team and brings with him extensive food industry and finance experience.  You'll hear from Chris later in the call and you'll have an opportunity to get to know him better in the coming weeks and in particular at our Investor Day in December.  ", "With that, Ken will now discuss our operating results for the quarter.  ", "Kenneth F. Spitler ", "Once again, I am pleased with the operational results we achieved during the quarter.  Our operating company's did a great job managing the business during the quarter.  Operating expenses were down $132 million or 9.5% compared to the prior year, mainly due to the lower payroll expenses.  Our headcount is down 5% year-over-year and 9% over two years as we improve productivity throughout the company.  ", "Expense levels also reflect our pay-for-performance culture as incentive-based compensation continues to be down from the prior year.  As a result, our operating margin improved 0.4 points to 5.5%.  These results achieved in a tough environment reflect the broad range of capabilities and commitment of our operating companies.  ", "Our sales during the quarter were impacted by deflation of 3.4%, which has majored as an estimated change in the cost of products we buy.  We weathered similar levels of deflation in the early 2000s and we believe we will manage through these challenges again by continuing to find ways to operate more efficiently.", "We continue to lead the industry in operational efficiency and I'm pleased with how our companies continue to perform.  For example, in our U.S. Broadline company's year-over-year during the first quarter our diesel gallon usage decreased 2.3%, cases per trip increased 1% and warehouse cases per man hour improved 5%.  ", "However, these numbers only tell part of the story as they each represent improvements on top of improved results from the prior year.  For example, over the past two years, comparing the first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2008, we improved our error frequency per cases shipped to an error rate of 1 out of 1,700 from an error rate of 1 out of 1,200 cases.  Cases per trip increased 3.4% and total sales per employee increased 6%.  ", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $109 million.  Looking ahead, we still expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million as we continue to invest in our business.  This spending includes maintenance items, such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs and growth items, such as expansions of our current facilities and potential foldouts.  Our capital spending also includes expenditures related to our ongoing ERP project.  ", "As we discussed last quarter, the ERP project is about a lot more than technology.  We are taking the opportunity to review many of our processes to find ways to further streamline our operations and grow our business.  In the end, the technology is an enabler for what we are designing, which is a business transformation.  We have largely completed the design work and will provide an update on the project in December.", "In closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their continued hard work to support our customers and improve our operations.  Now I'll turn it over to Chris for a discussion of our financial results for the quarter.", "Chris Kreidler", "", "Before I summarize the first quarter results, I'd like to say what a privilege it is to join Sysco.  I recognize the long history Sysco has of delivering impressive financial results to all stakeholders.  The balance sheet strength, responsible management of the business, continued innovation and focus on customer service and the quality of the associates at this company are unmatched and I look forward to being a part of this team.", "For the first quarter of fiscal 2010, sales were down 8.1% due primarily to lower volumes, estimated deflation of 3.4%, and the impact of foreign exchange rates which reduced sales by 0.5%.  These items were partially offset by the impact of acquisitions which increased sales 5.6%.  Net earnings for the quarter increased 17.8% to $326 million.  ", "Similarly, EPS for the quarter increased 19.6% to $0.55 per share.  The $0.55 per share includes a $0.05 after-tax income benefit related to the IRS settlement and a $0.04 favorable impact related to the increase during the quarter and the cash render value of corporate owned life insurance which we refer to as COLI.  The $132 million reduction in operating costs that Ken discussed earlier was primarily due to lower payroll expense.  The reduction also included a $44 million benefit from the year-over-year change in value related to the performance of COLI.  ", "Income tax expense declined $65 million year-over-year including a $25 million benefit from the reversal of an accrual related to the IRS settlement, which the company announced on August 25, and a $17 million reduction in expense as a result of the change in value related to the performance of COLI.", "With regards to the tax settlement, we paid $316 million to the IRS during the quarter.  The company will continue to make quarterly payments of $53 million through the fourth quarter of 2012.  In spite of the $316 million payments to the IRS, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $46.5 million, a decrease of only $16.9 million from the prior year.  The decline was primarily driven by the tax settlement payment partially offset by working capital improvements and lower incentive compensation payments in the current year versus prior year.  ", "In closing, I'd like to thank everyone at Sysco for welcoming me to the team and I certainly look forward to interacting with the investment community as we move forward.  With that, operator we will now take some questions.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Ajay Jaim \u2013 Hapoalim Securities.", "Ajay Jaim \u2013 Hapoalim Securities USA", "First on the tax rate, if I add that $29 million as the after-tax amount for the IRS adjustment, the implied tax rate is around 36%, which still seems lower than what I would have expected for normalized tax rate, is there anything else driving a lower tax rate apart from the IRS settlement that you can speak to? ", "William J. DeLaney III ", "", "Ajay, we're still in transition here so I'm going to fumble through some of this finance stuff here for one more quarter.  Essentially, it's what you just said plus what Chris was alluding to was the COLI.  COLI was favorable in same comment, but it's not taxable.  So those are the two key things and if you adjust for those that'll bring you into that 38%, 39% range.  ", "Ajay Jaim \u2013 Hapoalim Securities USA", "I also just wanted to confirm how much bad debt expense was actually recognized on the P&L last quarter.  It looks like losses on sale of receivables or we're down year-over-year, is that correct? ", "William J. DeLaney III ", "Yes, it's about $8.5 million.  I think it's on the funds flow statement.  That's in the earnings release.  It's a little bit less than last year.  We've had some recoveries and so far we continue to do a nice job managing credit, still kind of cautious in terms of the environment but it's a little bit less than last year. ", "Ajay Jaim \u2013 Hapoalim Securities USA", "So the cash flow and saving figure is consistent with what you accrued on the P&L?  ", "William J. DeLaney III ", "It's exactly what we accrued on the P&L.", "Ajay Jaim \u2013 Hapoalim Securities USA", "So do you think you're at an inflection point now where credit quality is improving or do you think it's still premature to make that assessment?", "William J. DeLaney III ", "I think that one is a little early to call.  We've pretty consistently said over the last couple of years that credit is more of a lagging indicator.  And again, we're pleased with how we're managing it but I don't think we're out of the woods yet on credit. ", "Ajay Jaim \u2013 Hapoalim Securities USA", "I just had one final question on payroll expense.  I think Ken confirmed the figure on the year-over-year decline in headcount, but can you just provide the figure for payroll expense was all the $130 million in lower operating expense from payroll?  ", "William J. DeLaney III ", "We're going to file the Q tomorrow and there's a number in there.  I think it's \u2013", "Chris Kreidler", "$68 million to $70 million which related to payroll I believe.  ", "William J. DeLaney III ", "So it's around $70 million and that's a combination of both wages, as well as incentive payments. ", "Ajay Jaim \u2013 Hapoalim Securities USA", "Do you have any feedback for just over the balance fee or how much room is there to go on the payroll side without the risk of hurting your street account relationships? ", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Yes, actually Ajay there's still, again, we're shipping cases so a lot of our transportation and warehouse are 1 to 1.  However we are beginning to build our sales force again, so last quarter we added marketing associates.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research Company.", "Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Could you guys provide a little more color or clarity on the case improvement?  Is that sequential volume improvement where you're actually seeing an increase in cases, you mentioned the rate of decline is changing at a comparison figure versus last year when maybe the business started to soften up a little bit and maybe just the outlook in general where you think some of the drivers to drive cases going forward might be? ", "William J. DeLaney III ", "I'll start Jay, and then Ken will jump in here.  We've struggled with the exact precision of the language and really all we're trying to say is the rate of the year-over-year decline is flat now and hopeful it will begin to start moving the other way here as the quarter goes along.  We're somewhat encouraged.  We're still in a very fragile stage of this recovery, if that's what we are in the middle here and beginning of right now.  So all we're trying to say is our rate of decline has stabilized and we're hopeful that it's going to start to move forward, but it's still down year-over-year. ", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "We are seeing some positive movement sequentially and I would say good enough to start adding MA's again.  ", "Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "As far as drivers going forward I guess adding MA's it might be helpful, but I believe you've said a number of times in the last six months or so that you're trying to get a little bit back to some core sales and marketing initiatives.  Could you talk a little bit further about some progress on that and whether that's inclusive of refining a business review or a business development process or if there is anything else?  Ken, I think you mentioned last quarter about a stimulus program.  Where are we at within your ability to drive volume going forward, proactively?  ", "William J. DeLaney III ", "Well, it's all the above.  You just hit on it, Jay.  Obviously, it would help I guess as I said in my words it would help to get the consumer back on their feet and where our customers are seeing a little bit more growth.  But in the interim we're staying very close to our customers.  We continue not just to do business reviews, but we think we're getting better at targeting the right customers and the quality reviews are better.", "The stimulus package was really more of an attempt that we talked about last quarter to create some enthusiasm out there with our sales force and with our customers and adding the salespeople.  We're beginning to bring sales people back on over where we were a quarter or two ago is important as well, so those are all the basics that we do all the time.  We're just hopeful that this is a better time to be employing those tactics. ", "Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Last question on your own brand, the Sysco brand, is there any return of a focus on that to drive that business again?  Or to kind of continue to define that platform and anything that could change the mix shift or even the margin components of branded versus your own brand versus the national brands? ", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "", "Jay, this is Ken.  Yes, we've just begun a reemphasis of brand and brand sales, reemphasis in our sales force and in our sales meetings start driving those numbers back up.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "I'd like to just go back to the last question about the stimulus package.  There was some discussion on the last call about sort of general environment for discounting, which seemed to be a little hot or more aggressive than you'd seen in awhile.  Could you maybe just comment on what you're seeing there and how you feel your response is positioned?  Are you doing the right things?  Are your customers pleased with it? ", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Meredith, we certainly hope out customers are pleased with it.  The stimulus package certainly was an answer to a lot of discounting that has gone on in our competitive landscape.  It was well received by our marketing associates and well received by our customers.  ", "It was in an effort to just stimulate, so to speak, our customers and help our customers in a lot of areas where it was commodity type items that drive a lot of their food costs.  So it was well received.  Yes, we think we're doing the right things.  Our play book hasn't changed we've just got them all in play. ", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I'd like to go back to the answer you just gave about private label and I wasn't sure, you said a reemphasis of brand and brand sales.  Did you mean your own brand or did you mean national brands?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "No, I meant our brand that we're reemphasizing it with our sales force and our customer base.  ", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Then maybe just a little bit more discussion of the ability to cut expenses.  You've done absolutely an extraordinary job and I'll say again congratulations, but you're not yet seeing volumes stabilize.  Is there a point here where you just really can't reasonably cut any more, and actually maybe I should ask the question differently?  You've started adding marketing reps.  You clearly have confidence that you are going to see a stabilization of volume.  How much data do you have to tell you that this is the right timing to start adding the reps?  ", "Kenneth J. Spitler", "Well, that's very good question.  We are seeing some stabilization.  There's a lot of conflicting industry reporting out there whether the certain segments of the restaurant business is up or down.  And what we judge all this by is what's happening to our customer base.  We feel like it is stable.  We feel like that we have an opportunity to start being a little more aggressive in terms of taking more products, more customer share.  ", "We manage that sales force down with the rest of our headcount.  They're a big part of our headcount numbers.  We feel good about the second half of the year, and we are getting ready to \u2013 as industry leader we think it's our turn to start exerting some pressure on our competitors being more aggressive.  ", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "My final question would be about deflation.  We're certainly going to be cycling the big drops in perishables like dairy and produce.  What are you seeing in other parts of the products you sell, meat, any kind of deli or bakery items and what about the packaged stuff, the manufactured stuff you sell?  What's happening with pricing in those areas? ", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, the meat is down currently and has been for a while.  Poultry is up a little bit.  Seafood is down.  Grocery items are kind of up and down you might say, Meredith.  So our numbers right now are being driven by the dairy primarily, a little bit by produce and meat.  So to your point, we're going to wrap some of those numbers on a year-over-year basis.  We've got Larry Pulliam here today.  I'll let him speak a little bit to what he's seeing in some of the commodities.  ", "Larry Pulliam", "Yes, Meredith, let me speak about it two different ways.  One is as we look at the cost that we pay for goods, it's a lagging indicator.  As we look at the commodity reports that we analyze on a weekly and monthly basis, we have seen some firming up on prices, especially in the month of October.  We saw our commodity prices firming and we saw last year at this time prices began to fall fairly rapidly.  ", "So our comparisons are better in the month of October.  It remains to be seen.  We've got to watch our cost of goods as relates to those commodity prices, but I think the sentiment around here is we feel pretty good about moderation of that inflation number over the next month or two.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs.  ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Bill, a year ago when did you guys see business begin to fall off a cliff?  Was that about now or was that earlier? ", "William J. DeLaney", "It was about a week after Lehman went down, I think.  It was last September and then it fell off and I'd say it the wall November, December, Ken? ", "Kenneth F.  Spitler", "That's about right.  ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Do you think as we cycle some of those worse months, do you think that naturally gives way to case improvement, or not necessarily that we may just stabilize at a lower level for a while? ", "William J.  DeLaney", "Well, clearly the comparisons get a little bit easier as we get deeper into the second quarter and the second half of the year, so that should get us back toward that breakeven level.  The only hesitancy you're going to hear in my voice is just, like I alluded to a few minutes ago John, it's still a fairly fragile environment out there.  So some weeks are better than others.  ", "But the pattern we have seen in recent weeks and the reason you hear a little more optimism in our words is this rate of decline has stabilized.  We're hopeful that we're moving in the right direction.  What's not clear is to what extent we're going to see growth in the second half of the year, how much.  ", "Kenneth F.  Spitler", "Yes, we think about mid-December, of course, we benefit from the good comparison from bad numbers.  But, yes, we actually feel like with the work that we've done on expenses that we could do very well with flat cases.  And we feel like that we can do enough to start moving the cases in a positive direction in the second half of the year.  ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Do you have any good way of telling how much share you're picking up?  Are you accelerating faster than or are you seeing cases stabilize faster than everybody else? ", "Kenneth F.  Spitler", "Hard to say.  ", "William J.  DeLaney", "That's a hard one to call, John.  We think we're competing very well as I've said, but we work of the [Technomus] number and we'll see where they come in for they year and they tend to revise their numbers, but we certainly think we're holding our own there.  ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "What's happening with drop size now? ", "Kenneth F.  Spitler", "Drop size remains about where it has always been.  ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "So on the one hand restaurants would be ordering less, but you're probably cutting them back and some of them are dropping out.  Some of the low volume ones are dropping out.  So I guess is there stability? There seems to be stability in that metric.  ", "Kenneth F.  Spitler", "I think that's a good way to say it.  ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Headcount, how did that compare to last quarter?  Was it still down or are we seeing some increase or what? ", "Kenneth F.  Spitler", "It's about the same.  It's a little better.  It's down a little bit.  ", "William J.  DeLaney", "Are you talking about the delta? ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Yes, I know it's down 5% year-over-year, but versus the end of the fourth quarter.  ", "William J.  DeLaney", "Yes, I think we were down five or six maybe in the fourth quarter.  ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "No, I meant the end of the fourth quarter versus the end of the first quarter.  ", "Kenneth F.  Spitler", "Small, it's still down.  ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Finally, what are we seeing now on the acquisition front?  You've talked about expectations were too high, has that finally fixed itself? ", "William J.  DeLaney", "I can't say that.  All I can tell you there, John, is we're still talking to some people.  The pipeline is not as deep as we'd like to see.  The expectation is case-by-case.  So we had a situation over the last few days where it looks like one of our competitors may have gone out of business in one of the markets and we'll pick up some business there.  So one way or another we're going after the business.  We'd like to acquire them and hopefully they'll find us.  Like I said, I think we've been saying this to you, we're becoming more proactive, but in the end it takes two people to make a deal work.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley.  ", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I wanted to focus in a little more on the expense line.  You started to see some significant year-over-year cost savings on operating expenses in third quarter.  I'm wondering what you're going to do when you start lapping out of those expense savings, specifically is the ERP program something that could help extend the cost cutting? ", "William J.  DeLaney", "Well, we're going to talk more about the ERP program in December in terms of what the impact of that is short-term and longer term.  As far as the comparisons second half of the year, they do become more challenging in the third and fourth quarters.  I'll let Ken speak to the headcount and that type of thing, but there's still room for improvement.  There's a law of dimension returns here at some point, but we still think we can make improvement on the expense side.  ", "Kenneth F.  Spitler", "Yes, it gets a little harder when we wrap around the next couple of quarters, but again, we're feeling positive about being able to exert some pressure on the competitors and move the cases forward.  And at the expense level that we're at right now, we feel like we can do very well there.  ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "So it sounds like on a basis points situation, you could still do better on SG&A if the cases are moving.  Is that fair? ", "Kenneth F.  Spitler", "Yes.  ", "William J.  DeLaney", "To come at your question from both sides, we really need to see some case growth here the second half of the year to improve the expenses.  ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "I guess we'll hear more on ERP in December.  ", "William J.  DeLaney", "Yes, sir.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets.  ", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "A follow up on the last question, you've done a great job of getting I think variable and fixed costs down pretty much at the same rate as volume.  So I guess what you're talking about is the leverage, let's say volume is going to turn up at some point in the future and let's say that's somewhat sooner than later, whatever.", "Is the operating leverage you're talking about going to come from bringing down that you basically have a fixed cost structure, because I just can't imagine how you can't, in a sense, have to add back variable cost almost at the same rate that the volume would uptick?  So would it be normal economics of leveraging the fixed cost that you've been able to bring down the cost structure?", "William J.  DeLaney", "A lot of this, we get into these discussions on what's fixed and what's variable, so we'd love to have the problem where it comes back so radically that we're up 8%, 10% and all of a sudden now you're talking about hiring people.", "But I think what we're realistically hoping for is a modest level of growth, and again Ken can speak to this more than me, but the reality is if you get a little bit of a case pickup, we can handle that for the most part with the drivers that we have, with the warehouse people that we have, and certainly with the other sales support.  We would like to see the sales the MA numbers start to pickup, but we can handle a moderate level of case growth with the folks we have out there today.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Yes, that's about the size of it.  Actually, just a little pickup in cases really greases our system better.  Our system works better with a little pressure on it.", "Andrew Wolfe - BB&T Capital Markets", "Gross margin, I don't think anyone's mentioned it yet, at least versus my expectations, and last quarter was really quite improved.  So could you talk a little about that in light of, I think you continued the stimulus program in the quarter.  Sysco brand penetration is down.  EMA was down, not as much as in prior quarters, but what's driving that, because it's hard to see what is driving it based on those criteria.", "William J.  DeLaney", "I don't think there's any one thing driving it.  Hopefully what comes through in our conferences and these types of calls is we're managing the business very aggressively at the account level and certainly cost control is a big part of it, but we need to be competitive.  The environment is extremely competitive out there right now, but our people know that they need to make a profit on the sales as well.  So it's more of an account-by-account management opportunity, that type of thing.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "I think our sales force is pretty good at managing and we've had, unfortunately, more experience than we want managing the deflationary times and inflationary times.  And the stimulus was not big enough to knock a hole in our margins, but just big enough to kind of stimulate some sales activity.  And again, we're just managing.  ", "We spend a lot of time and have spent a lot of time for fear out of that when we started stimulating sales that we did not want margins to go over the waterfall, so to speak, so we spent an awful lot of time with our sales force managing how to manage those individual margins at the individual customers, and I think that's been very successful for us.", "William J.  DeLaney", "The challenge with deflation is not so much the percentages obviously it's the dollars, so far we've been doing a nice job of continuing to create enough dollar growth to offset the expenses.", "Andrew Wolfe - BB&T Capital Markets", "Lastly on the same topic, and I appreciate that and it is quite a tribute to you guys that internal management.  What does that say about the external environment?  You mentioned a competitor.  I don't know if it's a large one or medium that went bust.  Does it say anything about the competitive environment that as things are getting tougher and tougher that maybe some folks were competing on price that's not practical any longer?  Is there anything you can read into that or anecdotally have heard in that regard, or is that a too optimistic view on things?Kenneth F. Spitler", "I don't think that's too optimistic.  I think that some of our smaller competitors have been in this difficult time for some time now.  It was a relatively small competitor that went out of business.  You see that occasionally.  And we participate in the right way in these orderly shutdowns where we try to help them salvage something out of their business.  So we like to be on the front end of these, as we categorize them, orderly shutdowns so that kind of everybody survives in it, but we anticipate seeing really more of that and I think it's just a difficult time for some of these smaller guys.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan. ", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan", "Philosophically have you considered reinvesting some of your cost savings and maybe even on the gross margin question that was asked previously back into your customer to try to gain market share that might be sticky coming out of this cycle?  Is that a lever that you may push going through 2010 especially as you have the income statement and the balance sheet that could handle such an investment?William J.  DeLaney", "Again, one of the points we try to make is, the answer is yes, but we do it account-by-account basis.  So we've got 8,000 give or take commission salespeople out there today selling groceries, so where it makes sense, that's what we're doing.  And where it's the right thing for the customer and the right things for Sysco, that's what we're doing.  What we don't necessarily subscribe to, the stimulus thing was a good thing to create some excitement commodity items like Ken talked about.  ", "It really wasn't so large that it was going to move the needle on gross profit one way or another.  But my point is what we don't do is get into these wholesale promotion-type activities, which frankly our experience and I think even other people's experiences are that that's a very slippery slope to go down.  So we certainly reinvest in our business and in our customers but on an account-by-account basis.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Basically we do that through the business review process where we know these customers.  The real question is what's sticky, and we like to invest in the money or invest some of these savings that you say where we know it's going to have a long-term sticky effect.  It's just been our experience over the years that when you kind of do it wholesale, it doesn't stick.", "", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan", "Unit development restaurant has proven over time to be a very lagging indicator.  Are you seeing any change in the trend in restaurant closures and is that beginning to stabilize now as we head into November?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "We don't know if it's stabilized or not.  The numbers that we're hearing is around 15,000 to 18,000 closures so far.", "William J.  DeLaney", "I think the one trend we can speak to is we're not seeing a lot of openings.  It's still pretty tough out there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup.", "Jeff Hans for Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup", "This is Jeff Hans on for Greg.  Just a quick question on the promotional environment in October, have you guys seen things intensify there versus kind of what you saw in the first quarter and the fourth quarter or is that stabilized in Q3?", "William J.  DeLaney", "I think it's very intense.  I don't know that it's any worse in October than it was in the summer and into September, but it's still very competitive out there.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "But it hasn't intensified in any way.", "Jeff Hans for Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup", "Then I think last quarter you guys mentioned you'd make a decision on the RDC this September or a few months ago.  Any update there?  Are you going to go forward?", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "We're in the process of making that decision now and what I can tell you is we're fairly positive about it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Cummins \u2013 Shields & Company.", "", "Robert Cummins - Shields & Company", "All of my questions have been answered already, but I did have one that sort of ties in with comments that were made before.  With your sales down 8%, is it possible to quantify how much of that 8% is simply customers closing up shop and going out of business that will never be seen again, and how much of it is reduced same-store volume for your customers?", "William J.  DeLaney", "Most of it is reduced same-store volume, Bob.  There's certainly some of what you mentioned there and there's more in lost business and people going out of business than what we've seen in years gone by.  But in terms of what we look at, when you look at penetration, that's really where most of that lost business is, which is at our customer level.", "Robert Cummins - Shields & Company", "Which is positive because at some point people are going to go back to restaurants again.", "Kenneth F. Spitler", "Yes, exactly.  We track that very closely and certainly the closures aren't off the charts for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ajay Jaim \u2013 Hapoalim Securities USA.", "", "Ajay Jaim - Hapoalim Securities USA ", "", "I just had one final question.  I was wondering if you can talk briefly about margin trends by segments since I don't think that's disclosed in the earnings release, specifically for the specialty business that are grouped together under the all other category?  Last year I think margins were down pretty significantly for the all other bucket.  Can you comment on what was driving that last year and whether or not there was any improvement in profitability for the specialty businesses in Q1?", "William J.  DeLaney", "Are you talking about operating margins, Ajay?", "Ajay Jaim - Hapoalim Securities USA", "Yes.", "William J.  DeLaney", "Again, we'll file the Q so it's not in this quarter earnings release that we're looking at today.  What I can say is I think you'll see good operating leverage in the operating segments, but you're going to see sales declines.", "Ajay Jaim - Hapoalim Securities USA", "Any color on what was driving the decrease in EBIT margins last year?  I think they were down 70 basis points for other.  ", "William J.  DeLaney", "Yes, I can tell you it was COLI.  The way that falls out in the segments, a lot of the corporate expenses get dropped into that other area, I think.  I'm going to ask you to follow-up with Neil later because I'm shooting from the hip here, but I think it had to be a corporate type of item that would have impacted it in that way.", "Operator", "At this time there are no further questions.

On the second quarter of fiscal 2010 Sysco reported net earnings of $268 million and earnings per share of $0.45 which is up 12.5% compared to the prior year.", "Sales trends improved throughout the quarter with the year over year rated decline swelling to only 3%, a result largely driven by deflation. Notwithstanding the challenging economic conditions, operating margin improved due in part to the favorable impact of COLI as well as excellent cost control throughout the organization. Ken will discuss this in more detail in a few minutes.", "Despite these challenging times, we remain steadfast in our commitment to helping our customers achieve their objectives. We are executing well and reinvesting in our business. Challenges have historically provided opportunities for Sysco to further differentiate ourselves in the marketplace because our customers increasingly look to us for support and business solutions. As the industry leader, we have an unsurpassed ability to leverage our size and scale to benefit our customers. ", "Our financial results for the quarter reflect the disciplined operational execution and excellent customer service to operating companies each and every day. While encouraged by our financial and operating performance today, we remain committed to continuous improvement and consistently look for opportunities to gain additional efficiencies in this competitive industry.", "For example, our business transformation project remains on tract with the objectives discussed at our investor day in December. We expect the improvements driven by this multi-year project will allow us to grow sales, reduce operating costs and more effectively utilize data in our decision making.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn things over to Ken so he can provide further detail on this and other operational improvements and how we performed in the second quarter.", "Kenneth Spitler", "I\u2019d like to start by thanking our operating companies for their hard work during the quarter. These results reflect their dedication to our customers and to helping our business succeed in challenging times.", "Our sales during the quarter were impacted by deflation of 3.5% which is measured as the estimated change in the cost of products we buy. Deflation from dairy and beef products had the largest impact with the balance spread across several categories. On a year over year basis, deflation pressures appear to be moderating from the highs we saw earlier in the quarter. ", "Our operating margin improved to 5.2% in the second quarter. While COLI contributed to this improvement we also significantly reduced payroll expenses and improved productivity in all aspects of our business.", "We have continued to manage head count in a manner consistent with the sales environment throughout the entire organization. Our head count is down 4% year over year and 10% over two years as we improve productivity throughout the company.", "Operationally, we continue to focus on productivity which is evident in many of our key operating metrics on a year over year basis, but the progress of our operating companies have made is even more clear on a two year basis.", "For example, in our U.S. Broadline companies, our diesel gallon usage is about flat with last year\u2019s second quarter but is down more than 10% compared to the second quarter of 2008. Cases per trip increased 3% year over year and 4% versus two years ago.", "Warehouse cases per man hour improved 8% year over year and 15% versus two years ago and we improved our error frequency per cases shipped from an error rate of one out of 1,229 in the second quarter of 2008 to an error rate of one out of 1,799 this quarter.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $138 million. Looking ahead we still expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million as we continue to invest in our business.", "This spending includes maintenance items such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs as well as growth items such as expansions of our current facilities, potential fold outs and technology. Technology spend includes capital related to our business transformation project.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris for a discussion of our financial results for the quarter.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thank you Ken. As previously discussed for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 sales were down 3% and estimated deflation was 3.5%. As Ken just mentioned, deflation appears to be moderating from highs we saw earlier in the quarter.", "Sales were also impacted by foreign exchange rates which increased sales by 1.2% and the impact of acquisitions which increased sales by .6%. While case volume remained negative early in the quarter, it turned positive towards the end of the period.", "Operating margin in the second quarter improved to 5.2% from 4.6% last year, a 60 basis point improvement. In addition, operating costs were lower in the second quarter by $96 million.", "Ken walked through the main drivers earlier and I\u2019d like to give you the numbers in a little more detail now. The decline in operating cost is primarily due to a $37 million benefit from the year over year change in value related to the performance of COLI and a $25 million decline in payroll expense.", "Operating expenses also improved by $29 million due to lower fuel expenses. However, fuel surcharges which are reflected in gross margin were also lower during the period, offsetting most of the benefit from lower fuel expense.", "Net earnings for the second quarter increased 12.9% to $268 million. Similarly the EPS for the quarter increased 12.5% to $0.45 per share. The $0.45 per share includes a $0.01 favorable impact related to an increase in the cash render value of COLI compared to $0.40 in the prior year which included a $0.05 negative impact from COLI.", "Turning to a brief update on our business transformation initiative, you\u2019ll recall that at our investor day in December, we shared with you our expectation that the incremental impact of this project would decrease diluted EPS in fiscal 2010 by an estimated $0.05 per share. The project remains on track and our expectations have not changed.", "Cash flow from operations for the first half of the fiscal year was $144 million compared to $562 million in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations was impacted by IRS settlement payment which totaled $422 million in the first half of the year. Additionally, cash flow in the first half of last year was impacted by the timing of certain other tax payments.", "Last year in the second quarter we were allowed to defer approximately $280 million in tax payments until the third quarter which was a benefit allowed the Houston area companies in the wake of Hurricane Ike. As you would expect this year we were not afforded the same deferral and the net effect causes our tax payments this year to appear significantly greater than last year.", "In closing, I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work during the second quarter and for your interest in Sysco.", "With that, we\u2019ll take some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "What\u2019s been the trend this quarter, last quarter in average drop size?", "Kenneth Spitler", "It\u2019s declining slightly.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s obviously deflation weighing on that. Do you think it\u2019s not down as much as deflation because you\u2019re seeing some weaker guys drop out and that\u2019s raising the average?", "Kenneth Spitler", "I don\u2019t know about the weaker guys part but I think it is pretty much deflation.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So it might be down as much as the rate of deflation you\u2019re seeing.", "Kenneth Spitler", "Yes.", "William DeLaney", "I think our guys are doing a good job. Our folks are doing a good job managing the pieces given there\u2019s still a lot of pressure in the marketplace obviously.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "When you think about incremental profit margin on something like that as you go from 3% deflation to zero or a little bit positive, the incremental margin on that has got to be fairly high. Have you looked at what that might be? It\u2019s got to be double digit I would imagine, maybe even higher than that.", "William DeLaney", "We really don\u2019t look at it like that. What we look at is more along the lines of your first question. The key economic metric for us is gross profit dollars per stock and as long as we can manage that even through these difficult times when the penetration was off some and pieces were down, if we can somehow compete to minimize that loss of pieces, obviously price our products appropriately, that\u2019s what we do and generally that usually ends up to get results for us.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "ERP costs or business transformation costs, what was that? Do you have that for the first half of the year that we can back into the second half?", "Chris Kreidler", "I\u2019ll preview a little of what you\u2019ll see in the 10-Q. As we\u2019ve said in December, the total cost of the project was $900 million. We expect that the total spend in 2010, or we do expect now to be somewhere between $250 million and $275 million.", "The first half we spent approximately one-third of that and so the rest will be in the second half of the year. The capital portion of that $250 million to $275 million is estimated to be about $160 million to $175 million.", "So the incremental impact from business transformation we expect to be $40 million to $50 million which would be a reduction in operating income this year. That\u2019s our $0.05 a share that we previewed in December.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Would the OpEx part of that also be one-third/two-thirds split?", "Chris Kreidler", "It\u2019s roughly correct, yes.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "What\u2019s the environment right now? I imagine it hasn\u2019t changed much since December, but the environment acquisition wise, is there much difference domestic versus international?", "William DeLaney", "The focus is more domestic right now. I would say to you we continue to try to develop relationships where that makes sense. I would say to your point that the environment is not much different.", "I would say also, our environment continues to be very proactive. We\u2019re looking at as much as we can. We\u2019re not waiting for the calls to come in. But I think it\u2019s still, characterize it as an environment where if you don\u2019t need to sell your business right now, you\u2019re probably not going to be overly interested in doing that.", "But the problem is more quality of asset as opposed to price. Price was the problem in the past. That all comes together once you\u2019re talking to people but I think right now folks, they\u2019ve got earnings pressure. That\u2019s not necessarily a great way to start negotiation in terms of applying a multiple.", "Maybe there\u2019s just an element that everyone is so focused on running their business right now that they don\u2019t really look at it that way, but I think it will pick up. We\u2019ve been saying that for awhile. We\u2019ve been disappointed that we haven\u2019t seen more activity, but I can tell you internally, we\u2019re tightening up our process and making sure that we are exploring things that make sense.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe \u2013 J.P. Morgan.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I was wondering if you could illuminate the comment that your case volumes have stabilized towards the end of the second quarter. On the casual dining at least on a reported basis, you stayed very weak, traffic down approaching 5%. QSR from what we understand got worse in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. So if you could give us a little bit of a look through in terms of what types of accounts you have, restaurants or other business that\u2019s doing really well from you and if you could also put that comment in terms of how much of the stabilization and sales trends is just from the fact that you\u2019re taking much more share per account.", "Kenneth Spitler", "I think the question is how did the quarter look for us in terms of increasing our cases through our operation and sequentially it got better as we went along to the point of December was relative to the rest of the environment, pretty good month where we saw a nice little bump in cases.", "That hits the rest of the question which is how does it look in January and we\u2019re still seeing positive cases, but it\u2019s declined from the December numbers. So we\u2019re still optimistic because it generally does that anyway, so it\u2019s following kind of a standard pattern if you will. But the good news is it\u2019s still positive.", "As far as there are still closures going on in the restaurant business? You\u2019re still seeing certain parts of the industry that you know about that are declining in case sales. ", "Part of our business too is not related necessarily to the restaurant business which is health care is no pun intended, quite healthy and growing and of course our institutional business, the schools and those kinds of things have maintained their sales.", "The other part is, yes, I think we are taking share. It\u2019s still one of those difficult questions to answer for you because it\u2019s hard to sort out declining cases in certain customer bases and where you\u2019re gaining share in other cases. So it\u2019s really hard to sort out.", "It\u2019s just that at the end of the day, the real measurement that we\u2019ve got to us is we are increasing our cases, and the answer to that is yes. ", "John Ivankoe \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "If you wouldn\u2019t mind, can you even look through a little bit more especially on your Boardlines business? Is there geography specifically that\u2019s doing very well and is there a type of account within Broadlines perhaps in restaurants that\u2019s doing particularly well, especially relative for example the first quarter?", "Kenneth Spitler", "We\u2019re still continuing to have a rough go in the Midwest and in the Florida area and somewhat on the Southern West Coast, so that kind of remains the same. The Southwest is doing pretty good. The Northeast is holding its own. Northwest seems to be holding its own.", "Within the category of restaurants, it seems to us that the family style restaurant, the restaurant that is value driven is doing pretty well right now and the top end is still suffering, meaning $100 meal and up kind of places are still trailing pretty badly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "If you look at your head count reduction of about 4% how much of that do you think will hold when we start coming out of things and volumes really start picking up? It seems to me like you\u2019re going to have to add back some bodies when the case volume starts picking up.", "Kenneth Spitler", "We\u2019re already starting to add bodies in terms of the sales force. Sequentially we\u2019re up, I was looking at the number, it\u2019s about 75 to 100 we\u2019ve added sequentially over the last few months. So yes, we\u2019ve already started adding back sales people because we think that the environment is right for us to start continuing to leverage to grow sales.", "Then, it becomes a matter of, we have improved some productivity. We\u2019re still improving productivity. It\u2019s not going to be a one for one bring back, although it does have a lot to do with cases. To tell you I have that exactly in mind, but I can tell you this, that we will be a leaner organization as the sales start to grow because as we\u2019ve been forced by the environment, we\u2019ve gotten a lot more productive.", "When you have an error rate in our business of one in 1,800 and then you, just in the last some \u201908 to \u201909 to 10, we\u2019ve gone from 695 cases to 701 to 722. Those are all the kind of things that you don\u2019t back up on. You don\u2019t need to back up on. Continuous improvement, your cases per man hours, those are big numbers to us and we\u2019re getting improvement on those.", "Just because the economy gets better those numbers don\u2019t go down. So we\u2019ve really been in some ways forced to do, to get better faster, and we\u2019ve still got a lot of initiatives out there that we talked about in December to really improve our productivity. So long story short, I rambled a little bit. I\u2019m sorry but these improvements are sticking.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "If you could just give us a little snapshot, you talked a little bit about share and which segments are doing better or worse and parts of the country are doing better or worse, but how is the price competition out there right now and what are you seeing in that regard?", "Kenneth Spitler", "It\u2019s tough. Very aggressive competitors on the price front. That\u2019s not our first rodeo there of course. We\u2019re used to being the market leader so we\u2019re used to staving off price attacks. It\u2019s been a lot more frequent and of course the customer base gets a little more upset, so we\u2019ve had to be cautiously defensive about that but there\u2019s definitely an uptick to it.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Have you generally been matching where you\u2019ve been meeting competition?", "Kenneth Spitler", "I wouldn\u2019t say we always match the price, but that\u2019s a waterfall that you don\u2019t want to go over but we\u2019ve found ways to hang on to our business without destroying our margins which is no mean trick.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ajay Jain \u2013 Hapoalim Securities.", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "I wanted to back to the question about the improved case volume trends. If I understood correctly, it sounds like volume stabilized further in November and December relative to what you presented at the Analysts Day, so I\u2019m wondering is there any read through for the Indiana RDC based on what you\u2019re seeing right now? Are you close to a decision there?", "Kenneth Spitler", "We\u2019re pretty close. What we\u2019d like to see, as you know, our business, we make this quarter in March and if we continue to see good paced growth through March, we\u2019ll feel very comfortable about going forward.", "We couldn\u2019t put a shovel in the ground in Indiana right now anyway so I will feel comfortable after we see the March numbers and the quarter numbers. I feel pretty comfortable that we\u2019re going to go forward with it, but we\u2019d like to see those numbers stabilize. We need positive cases to make the RDC go around and we won\u2019t build it until we see it.", "William DeLaney", "I just want to clarify something in terms of how you caveat that question. I would say to you that the volume trends we\u2019ve seen since the Analysts Day are very consistent with what we talked about. We were starting to see that uptick in late November and December, very mild and modest, and that\u2019s how it stands.", "But to Ken\u2019s point, this is a unique quarter and until we get in March, it\u2019s really hard to draw any conclusions.", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "On the improvement in comparisons for bad debt expense, my question is whether that improvement is a function of the operating environment just getting better or if there is something specific that you\u2019re seeing with your customers in terms of their credit quality?", "Kenneth Spitler", "We manage the credit the same way we\u2019ve managed it for 35 years, so we have just been very careful and cautious. I can\u2019t really tell you whether it\u2019s, I think we have good customer quality at Sysco and that\u2019s one of the things that you\u2019re seeing in our write offs is that our customers have managed their businesses pretty well too.", "Chris Kreidler", "I think if you look at least year you\u2019ll see the third quarter we really took a pretty substantial hit by our standards so we go up against that this quarter. So again, our folks do a good job managing credit. We\u2019ve been fortunate. Part of that is customer quality.", "We haven\u2019t had any big hits and hopefully that will continue, but I would still tell you it\u2019s still pretty fragile out there.", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "On the head count reduction, I wanted to clarify one thing. It sounded like you\u2019re hiring more sales people so I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the additional head count in marketing associates that Ken talked about with the decrease in payroll costs that you just reported. Should we infer that you\u2019re adding more customer contact personnel but lowering head count in other areas of the company?", "Kenneth Spitler", "Not necessarily, no. It\u2019s sequential first of all. We\u2019re still down from over a year ago, but it\u2019s strictly marketing associates that we\u2019re adding.", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Hapoalim Securities", "I\u2019m still trying to reconcile the delta. If your payroll costs are down year over year, you\u2019re saying that\u2019s all marketing associate driven?", "William DeLaney", "No, what we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re down year over year in head count including in sales, and down in payroll. And then what Ken was saying earlier is that as we\u2019re managing the business going forward sequentially, we\u2019re beginning to add sales people.

I know that you had less fuel costs but also less fuel surcharge. The fuel prices are starting to go up again. Can you talk a little bit about how you think that plays out for the rest of the year?", "Kenneth Spitler", "We of course are very conservative about how it plays out the rest of the year. Everything that we\u2019re seeing and reading and being coached on tells us that what we\u2019re seeing about as a barrel price right now is about what we can expect the rest of the year so we\u2019re not looking for any big increases.", "William DeLaney", "We still have some forward contracts out there, about a third.", "Kenneth Spitler", "We have about 40%. So we protected as much as we think we need to. So again, we\u2019re not diesel experts, we\u2019re just trying to make the year over year comparison flat. But again, who knows? So our prediction from our experts that we rely on next year is going to relatively flat.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And the fuel surcharges would come back into place if they needed to?", "Kenneth Spitler", "They could at a certain level. We don\u2019t see that being triggered at this level.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "We haven\u2019t spoken about pension costs in a long time, but is there anything to comment on there? Is pension expense up meaningfully this year over last year?", "Kenneth Spitler", "In the K we detailed what pension expense would be for the year and we\u2019re on track on that. We don\u2019t have or foresee any significant multi-employer pension employments at this point, and as you recall we took a write off or write down on that last year I believe in the third quarter. It\u2019s about $8 million to $9 million a quarter.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I\u2019d like to go back to the question of the promotional environment. I\u2019m just wondering whether the gross margin ended up being pretty much in line with what you had expected for the quarter. You did have a pretty good gross margin performance last quarter, but we\u2019re about flat this quarter. Was there a surprise in that to you or was that in line with your expectation?", "William DeLaney", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s in line with our expectation given Ken\u2019s characterization of the market which is extremely competitive out there. It remains that way and I think we\u2019ll be fighting margins here for awhile.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Just to go back to what Chris was saying about the business transformation process, I think I\u2019m a little thick this morning. The numbers that Chris, you talked about the $900 million and that\u2019s both CapEx and operating expenses and then you gave specific numbers, and I was just trying to make sure the numbers are $250 million to 4275 million in the first half. Is that a combination of CapEx and operating expenses?", "Kenneth Spitler", "Let me go back through it just to make sure we\u2019re clear. If you recall back in December, we said $900 million was the total cost of the project, both capital and operating expense. We also shared a bar chart that said that we expected 2010 to be about $275 million. We are now saying, you\u2019ll see this in the Q, we expect that to be a range of $250 million to $275 million for the year.", "So that\u2019s both operating expense and capital. The capital portion of that we expect to be $160 million to $175 million. That\u2019s the full year number. And then we gave the breakout, we spent about one-third of that to date and roughly a third both on the capital side and the operating expense side, so the remainder will be in the back half of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "On the expenses with the SAP and the transformation project, $100 for you is roughly about $0.10 a share. Does that mean you had $0.05 in there last year? I\u2019m also having a thickness issue with your numbers.", "Kenneth Spitler", "Again, not a thickness. It\u2019s a new topic. We haven\u2019t talked it about a lot so we know that there\u2019s going to be some education process here. We use the term incremental not to mean year over year.", "As we discussed in December, we put a lot of folks that were already here at Sysco onto this project, I think 312 was the number that we talked about in December. So those people were in our run rates, our expense run rates last year. Those folks are now working on the project.", "So when we talk about a $900 million project, that\u2019s the total cost including those people, but those people aren\u2019t incremental expense.

You\u2019re already spending $50 million to $60 million.", "Kenneth Spitler", "Round numbers, that\u2019s about right. We\u2019re now looking at all the outside folks that we\u2019ve had to hire to bring in to manage the projects.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "The tax rate, is that swinging around just on the COLI? ", "Chris Kreidler", "Primarily COLI and the tax settlement if you\u2019re looking at the first half. Tax settlement obviously affected the tax rate to the tune of I think 300 basis points, 320 basis points. And then COLI which is not deductible for income tax purposes affected it both this year and last year different directions.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "On the consolidation side, I read a recent news story out of Michigan where this company up there, Clark Food Services apparently closing one of their DC\u2019s.

It was an orderly shut down at best.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "You had referenced that, as an industry leader you have a certain responsibility and I understand that, but what I really want to know, I assume in the long run getting these customers is probably a good thing. Is this kind of liquidation something you think is a one off or is this something that if the environment doesn\u2019t pick up that we might see some more of?", "Kenneth Spitler", "I think we\u2019re going to see some more of it. They just run up to the post here and it\u2019s over. They do care about their employees. They want a little help with their inventory. We can do all of that for them and are glad to do it. It\u2019s good for us. It\u2019s good for them.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "So on consolidation, it kind of looks like if things don\u2019t get better, this could happen and if things got better, Sysco might hit the bids on some improving businesses? Is that somewhat a realistic way to look at how consolidation could influence you?", "William DeLaney", "I\u2019m not sure I understand that question.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "If the environment gets better and these reluctant sellers, their EBITDA goes up, it would be easier to buy them.", "William DeLaney", "We certainly hope so, and like I say, we have antennae\u2019s up and we\u2019re doing what we can do but they\u2019ve got to get to a point where they want to sell their business and negotiate in a reasonable way and as Ken said, sometimes these types of deals you\u2019re talking about right now are sometimes they just ran out of shoes at the finish line. It\u2019s not always protracted discussions.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "On deflation, has it switched to inflation yet overall and can you give a little bit of a category flavor?", "William DeLaney", "It hasn\u2019t switched. It continues to moderate and categories would be in terms of deflation, the ones that are driving up to this point, would be dairy, beef, that type of thing. Going forward, some of this what we\u2019d like a lot of these numbers, you\u2019ve got to wrap some numbers here pretty soon, so we would expect the dairy deflation pressure to ease and beef is probably a harder one to call.", "On the supply side there is not oversupply but the demand continues to be weak and that seems to be keeping those prices under pressure. So we\u2019ll have to see there. So we\u2019re hoping to see a continuation of the moderations if you will and at some point see some mild inflation. But it\u2019s hard to call.", "Kenneth Spitler", "We\u2019re not sure of the timing but from our merchandizing folks, them talking to the manufacturers, there is a feeling and a prediction of inflation to come and most significantly big areas of beef, pork, poultry, dairy. So that would be good news for us. I hope that\u2019s right.", "William DeLaney", "Again when you start talking inflation, especially in this environment, the best scenario for us to two or three points.

Or have you basically taken up all the low hanging fruit?", "Kenneth Spitler", "Well none of it is low hanging. It all takes a lot of work and we still have plenty of room out there to improve and we\u2019ve still got 10 initiatives prior to the installation of our first SAP that we want to finish that will give us another pretty significant boost in our productivity.", "Just to give you an example, we\u2019re going to continue to run on our Swim\u2019s platform which is our operating system in the warehouse as opposed to SAP\u2019s so we have an initiative out there that is a best practices initiative. It\u2019s all I call it switch driven, but doing certain things a certain way and all of our operating companies within three months are going to go best practices. So we\u2019ll have that finalized in July.", "We should see a really nice uptick across the board for productivity. So again, we have 10 of those out there. That\u2019s just one of them. So to say that we\u2019re all done is not true. We\u2019ve still got lots of room. We\u2019ve still got lots of improvement.", "There are some definitive spots where we run up against, physically we\u2019ll probably be able to get to about our 750 to 760 cases per truck and then you run out of room. But there are lots of other productivity measures that we continue to increase on and continue to have room to do.", "William DeLaney", "I think when you read the Q you\u2019re going to see the tone on this issue is just what Ken said, we certainly see room for improvement. There\u2019s a lot going on. The rate of improvement is not going to be what you\u2019ve seen over the last 12 to 18 months. ", "Kenneth Spitler", "Keep in mind too that most of these are case driven and we\u2019ve got cases going down. You get some case improvement you get some improvement just by the nature of the math. So we\u2019ve got headwinds all over the place and still improving.", "Operator", "With that there are no other questions in the roster so we thank you for your participation in the Q&A session and for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Neil Russell", "Thank you, Casey, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2010 Conference Call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or projections of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner. ", "Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings including, but not limited to risk factors contained in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 27, 2009, and in the company's press release issued earlier this morning. ", "Please understand that all comparisons given during the call refer to changes between the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the third quarter of fiscal 2009, unless otherwise noted. Also all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted.  ", "With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Sysco reported net earnings of $248 million. Earnings per share were $0.42, an increase of 10.5% compared to the prior year. Sales increased 2.4% for the quarter, the first year-over-year quarterly increase in sales since our September 2008 quarter. This increase was driven by improving case volume and benefits from foreign currency translation. ", "Case volume grew year-over-year in the third quarter. The numbers week-to-week were a bit uneven but we saw a sequential improvement in each month throughout the quarter. As we have indicated in our last call on February, March trends typically drive third quarter results and our performance for the quarter was favorably impacted by stronger sales growth in March than we originally anticipated. ", "Deflation was 0.8% for the third quarter, which is substantially less than the 3.4% deflation we experienced in the first half of the year. Deflation subsided sequentially each month as we move through the quarter, with March coming in essentially flat. These changes were driven by higher prices in dairy, meat and produce. ", "Operating margin improved year-over-year to 4.8%. I'm particularly pleased with our associates' ability to leverage of the sales growth we saw during the quarter. All of our employees are dedicated to helping our customers succeed and remain focused on driving continued improvements in service and productivity throughout the organization. Our financial results reflect Sysco's ability to execute effectively in a dynamic and highly competitive market.", "We currently have a number of initiatives underway which are intended to improve certain operating processes, which we described at our Investor Day last December. Many of these initiatives have contributed to our operating margin performance over the last several quarters in our Broadline Companies. These include efforts to standardize warehouse operating systems, utilize discrete engineered labor standards and implement activity-based compensation. ", "While the implementation of some of these changes is nearing completion, we have a pipeline of various other initiatives in the early stages of rollout that we expect to complete over the next 12 to 15 months. This include initiatives to implement new systems to determine the most efficient product placement on our trailers, scan orders as they are taken off the trucks and better manage fuel consumption and fleet maintenance. In addition, we remain on track with our business transformation project. We have substantially completed the design phase, and we are currently building and testing the underlying ERP system and processes with extensive resources dedicated to this critical phase. ", "We anticipate going live with the implementation of the ERP system at our first offering company in early calendar 2011. As a result, we're beginning to process for getting our shared services operation up and running to support the first location and the others that will follow. During the third quarter, we purchased a facility in Houston that will house this organization, which will be known as Sysco Business Services [ph](9:11). We expect to begin staffing this facility in the second half of this calendar year. ", "It's important to understand that we are not simply waiting for our ERP system to go live to realize benefits from this project. We are making numerous changes along the way to prepare for the transformation, and many of these changes will provide modest benefits before we actually go live. An example is the standardization of warehouse operating systems that I've mentioned a few minutes ago. ", "Along the same lines, we have been populating [ph](9:41) our new online Order Management System, which will replace our eSysco platform and are now in the early phases of rolling it out to some of our contract customers. We're excited about the progress we're making and will continue to keep you informed of further developments along the way. ", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.", "Robert Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As Bill mentioned, we reported net earnings this morning of $248 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2010, an increase of 9.5% compared to the prior year period and the highest third quarter on record. ", "Sales increased 2.4% which was driven by year-over-year case volume growth; foreign exchange rates, which increased sales by 1.6%; and the impact of acquisitions, which increased sales by 0.6%. Offsetting these increases, estimated deflation was 0.8%, which is measured as the estimated change in the cost of products we purchased. ", "Operating margin in the third quarter improved to 4.8% from 4.6% last year, a 19 basis point improvement. Operating costs were higher in the quarter by $20 million. While there are multiple line items variances, the increase was primarily due to payroll expense that was $35 million higher in the current period. Approximately half of the increase in payroll expense was driven by higher incentive compensation accruals year-over-year. ", "Last year in the third quarter, we released our bonus accruals when it became clear that we would not meet our 2009 performance objectives. However, based on performance to the third quarter of this year, we believe that it's likely, we will meet our 2010 performance objectives and we continue to accrue them accordingly. The majority of the remaining year-over-year increase in payroll expense was due to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, assuming from the conversion of our Canadian results into U.S. dollars. It's important to note that while payroll expense was up for the reasons I just mentioned, headcount was actually down 2.6% year-over-year in the third quarter. ", "There were a few other notable operating expense variances compared to last year's third quarter. First, company-sponsored pension expense was $9 million higher in the current quarter which is in line with the guidance we gave in our 10-K. Second, last year, we had a $9 million loss in the third quarter related to COLI. This year, we recorded a $5 million gain resulting in a $14 million favorable comparison year-over-year. ", "Third, fuel expense was $13 million lower than last year. And fourth, the provision for bad debt we recorded in the current period was $12 million. This compares to $31 million in the prior year period, resulting in a $19 million favorable year-over-year comparison. The current provision is based on recent activity, and simply means that there are fewer customer accounts meeting our criteria for write-off. For the current quarter, our bad debt expense as a percentage of sales was 0.14%. ", "Earnings per share for the quarter increased 10.5% to $0.42 per share. The $0.42 of earnings per share include the $0.01 favorable impact related to an increase in the cash surrender value of COLI compared to $0.38 of earnings per share in the prior year, which included a $0.01 negative impact from COLI.", "Turning to a brief update on our business transformation initiative. Today, we are updating our fiscal 2010 estimate of the net impact of this project. The revised estimate I will provide you represents the net impact of the project on our financial results. This means that it includes estimated benefits from the project as we define them, and it excludes costs for those Sysco employees that we have redeployed and dedicated to this project. As we've discussed previously, we do not consider the cost of employees that were redeployed to the project to have an incremental impact on our financial result. And to be clear, this is the same basis underlying the estimates we provided at our Investor Day last December. We now expect the project will decrease diluted earnings per share this fiscal year by an estimated $0.03, which is lower than the $0.05 estimate we presented at our Investor Day. ", "As Bill discussed earlier, the project work is on schedule and the change in estimate is not an indication that we're behind schedule. The change is primarily attributable to two reasons. First, the balance between expense and capital spend has been more weighted to the capital side than originally estimated. As a result, EPS has not been impacted as much. At the same time, our cash expenditures for the projects are on track with expectations and consequently, we have not changed the total estimated cash outlay of the project. ", "Second, we're seeing slightly higher benefits than anticipated at this stage of the project. The benefits expected for this fiscal year are modest and come primarily from payroll savings. For example, when we redeployed people to the project, we anticipated that we would backfill certain positions. However, we've not yet done this to the degree originally projected, and this has resulted in a greater benefit.", "Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year was $466 million compared to $985 million in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations in the current period is net of IRS settlement payments, which totaled $475 million. ", "Working capital has slightly increased from the end of the prior fiscal year in June 2009. Receivables, payables and inventory have all increased due to the increase in sales in third quarter. In addition, receivables tend to trend upward at this point in the year. This is due to a seasonal shift in sales mix, with sales from multi-unit customers and full districts representing a larger percentage of our sales. ", "The other significant category of changes would've been working capital relates to the decline in accrued and deferred taxes. These declines are driven by IRS settlement payments made during the year and correlate to declines in cash. ", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $190 million. Looking ahead, we now expect capital spending for the full year to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million as we continue to invest in our business. This spending includes maintenance items such as ongoing fleet replacement and facility repairs, as well as growth items such as acquisitions, expansions of current facilities, potential foldouts and technology. Technology spend includes capital related to our business transformation project.", "In closing, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work during the third quarter and for your interest in Sysco. ", "With that, operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "I'd like to start by talking maybe a little bit about the growth you are seeing and whether there's anything in terms of the nature of the customers that are showing growth. Is there some variation between them and are there any surprises there?", "William DeLaney", "The growth were seeing it's -- first of all, it's just nice to see some growth. And I would say that were seeing it across pretty much all the lines of restaurant segments for different reasons. And so I think the quick serve or QSR continues to be pretty strong on a relative basis, although the comparisons there are tougher because they held up pretty well a year ago. What we think we're beginning to see with the consumer spending picking up somewhat is that the family-style, which as you know, basically, a family restaurant with all different varieties. That generally drives our business and that seems to be picking up as well. And I would say, even on the high end, where over the last year and a half, maybe almost two years, some of the high-end steakhouses, those types of places, those numbers are beginning to improve as well. Partially, I think, just because the comparisons are relatively easy, we've had a really tough year and a half or two years. So again, it's good to see the growth, it's still somewhat modest, but I would say it's across all segments.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And then I have a question about the shared services, whatever you call it, not just the facility but the operation. I'm not sure whether you talked about it in those terms when you had your analyst meeting. Could you maybe just describe what functions will be moving to the shared services operation?", "William DeLaney", "We probably didn't talk a lot about that in detail at the analyst meeting because we want -- it's far along in our design work. So generally and then obviously, this is something that we're continuing to refine our thoughts on and communicate internally. But generally, what you would find there would be more of your administrative type of services.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Administrative services that service lots of operating companies?", "William DeLaney", "Yes.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And then my final question is just about the competitive environment, because you do have a comment in your press release about it still being a highly competitive environment?", "William DeLaney", "Right.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Any more comment?", "Robert Kreidler", "We put that in there on purpose, or at least I did, from the standpoint that, like I said, we're pleased. We've seen strength in the economy here for a while. We think we're beginning to see the consumer participate. And as a result, we're seeing some growth with our customers, and obviously in our top line. I wanted to temper that a little bit with just the reality that it's still very competitive out there. And I wouldn't expect that to change a whole lot in the near term.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Neil Currie with UBS.", "Neil Currie - UBS Investment Bank", "I just wondered if you could maybe give us some insights on your outlook for deflation and any trends you're seeing in April so far, whether you're actually starting to move to inflation now?", "William DeLaney", "Our track record on projecting inflation and deflation isn't really strong. But what were trying to say, Neil, to you in our comments this morning is we believe that the deflation has subsided to the point where, as we say, in March, it was pretty flat. And we don't have a lot of information yet so far this quarter. But it looks like it is starting to pick up modestly. So I think we are back in an overall net inflationary environment, albeit very modest.", "Neil Currie - UBS Investment Bank", "In terms of underlying demand, you obviously talked about easy comparisons because it was so tough last year. But I wonder if you could talk to what's going on behind the underlying volume growth that you're seeing right now? How much of it is share growth, and how much of is -- how much have you seen a pickup in demand recently?", "William DeLaney", "Well, we're clearly seeing a pick in demand, and as I said, we're real pleased to see that. Obviously, it's good for our customers, it's good for our people. The psyche is, is that everyone in this industry is -- it's been difficult for the last year and a half or two years. So from that standpoint, we're seeing an overall pick up in demand. Yes, we think were still taking share. That's a hard question to answer at a given point in time. But we do not have any reason to believe that we're not continuing to take share. So we're pleased with the year-over-year numbers. I think if you go back two years, we would tell you that we're still a little bit below where we were two years ago. And I think that's consistent with our headcount reductions and that type of thing as well.", "Neil Currie - UBS Investment Bank", "And finally, I wonder how fragile or robust you think this recovery is? And if gas prices were to get notably higher over the summer, how would you think that might impact both demand? And do you opt only onto [ph](22:31) your customers?", "Robert Kreidler", "Well, we have fragile in one of our early drafts, Neil. We took it out because we think we've moved past fragile, but we're not quite robust. So somewhere it's in between there. I think what we need to see is -- personally, I'm really encouraged that we're starting to see the consumer start to participate. That's what we've said, all along, would be the key for us, is we can see case growth and that allows us to do what we're really good at, which is leveraging that case growth. So that's our best read in that situation right now, I think.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc", "Just in terms of a little bit on the kind of the food inflation and promotional environment. As you kind of go into an inflationary period, how much does that help you relative to when you look back two quarters ago, you're running even last quarter, negative low single digit? How much benefit do you get as you get to an inflationary environment?", "William DeLaney", "Greg, that's hard to quantify. What we've consistently said, and for those of us who have been around this business a long time, it does hold up. The preferred environment, we could pick an inflationary environment, it would be one of the modest inflation, one, two, maybe three points inflation, for a couple of reasons. One is it that's a level that typically, our customers have been able to handle over the years with their customers. And two, we can manage that fairly well. So that's the more favorable environment. The environment where we're in a year to two years ago, where we're looking at 6%, sometimes 8% inflation, that's not good for anyone. That's not good for the customer and certainly, not good for the industry. And then what we think we're coming out of the deflationary environment would be the least attractive, probably of the three. Although, I have to say we've been real pleased with how our folks have managed through that over the last 6 to 9 months or so, so it'll help us some. But I think the main thing, when you look at our business right now, where we're at right now is we need to see case growth, our customers need to see volume increases. So at relatively low levels of inflation, that shouldn't be a barrier.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc", "At then in terms of the promotional environment, as you start to see inflation, as you start to see some decent volume growth and that only builds as the consumer gets stronger, do you think that, that's going to abate the promotional environment?", "William DeLaney", "I think it will affect it. There's always a lot of promotion activity that goes on in our business, both with our customers and we do some, as do our competitors. I would hope that it results in a more targeted and more cost effective promotional environment. Whereas, what we were seeing six and 12 months ago is just kind of constant [ph](25:29) type of promotion activity, that is not clear that, that really was successful for a lot of people that implemented that. We really didn't approach it that way. We took a more targeted approach.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Bill, I think when you updated us last quarter, you said January was cases were up. But it sounded like barely, and I think, sounds like from your tone, February is sort of the same and then March strengthened up. Can you tell us a little about how you think -- and I'm inferring but I'd like to ask you directly, how April went? Did you see that kind of follow through? And could we expect perhaps an update on the Mother's Day, since May is a big month for the company?", "William DeLaney", "Now you're asking a lot there on Mother's Day. But as far as April, Andy, that's when we took fragile out of the early draft. I think we've seen now the month of April, and it's pretty comparable to what we saw in March. So again, we're not out of the woods to this recovery yet. But we're seeing two good months in a row, and April is encouraging. We'll see on Mother's Day. The tricky thing on Mother's Day is what I alluded to earlier. That is our biggest week of the year. And it's always an exciting week within the operating companies. But in terms of what that number is, hopefully, it will be up over last year. I think it'll be interesting to see where it is relative to two years ago.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "And just on the SAP update, some of those things sounds like getting some of the benefits perhaps above budget. Sounds like they could be longer lasting than just this fiscal year. Whereas, the accounting may not be, it may just be the way the project's rolling out. But should we, perhaps, anticipate some updates to beyond fiscal '10, perhaps when you present your fourth quarter numbers?", "Robert Kreidler", "Yes, you can anticipate updates. Our current intention is when we come out with fourth quarter, we'll give -- and I think, Sysco's traditionally giving guidance on a few items for next year, capital expenditures et cetera. And we've said that we will try to update you on the business transformation for 2011. We will also be taking a fresh look periodically, we're going through it now, on the entire chart that we presented in December. We may not present that in our fourth quarter update, but we would intend to present that, certainly, at our Investor Day later in the fall, winter. So you can expect updates as we go forward.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. I mean, it sounds like it's certainly coming in early at, but it's being run pretty tightly and some of the benefits are better than expected. Would we be getting ahead of ourselves if we took something away from that to the positive side?", "William DeLaney", "I'll echo what you just said. I think it's being run very, very tightly. I think the team that's running that is doing a good job of cost control. I wouldn't get to it you fork yet [ph] about seeing more benefits here. As we described and we were pretty careful to describe but say, you understood it.  Some of the benefits we're seeing right now is we didn't backfill yet some of the positions that we thought we would backfill. That doesn't mean we won't backfill them. Obviously, we don't hire people once we need them. But there's a chance we still will backfill some of those people and so that benefit would then go away, but we're giving you the best look that we've had right now. And that says that forward this year, we're not going to spend as much as we thought. But it was important that we noted that we're not changing the overall cost of the project. Eventually, we believe we're going to spend the money and it will be broken down between the capital and the expense fairly similar to what we had anticipated when we described it at Investor Day.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "And just one last question is a follow-up on the -- now that there's some inflation coming back. As your sales people and your operators are seeing week-to-week, sequential increases in protein and other categories, dairy, maybe keep produce out of this since it spiked. But sort of some more normal incremental inflation, the market basically absorbing that, which it normally does or are you seeing some sticky pricing and a little gross margin pressure?", "William DeLaney", "Well, we've seen -- like I said, Andy, it's Bill again. We've done a nice job managing the margins, I think through this last year. But it's been very competitive on the street, I would say especially right around the first of the calendar year and we've continued to work on margins here over the balance of the quarter into April. As far as the stickiness, I would say to your point, most of what we're seeing on the inflationary side is more commodity driven right now, but it's not radically up. Dairy's up but dairy's been down for quite a while. So I'd say we're -- so far would been able to pass along most of it.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Wanted to ask a little bit about your operating expense progression. You just lapped the big cost cuts from last year. The operating environment is getting a little better. I mean, what do you think is a reasonable progression for operating expense growth in percentage terms?", "William DeLaney", "Well, Chris is hesitating, so I'll start. I wish I knew the answer to that exactly, but I think what we need to call out here, Mark, is I think we're at an inflection point. So for the last year, year and a half, the way we have been looking at the business is how aggressively can we, should we cut relative to the decline in volume. And as you can see, we've been able to manage our headcount pretty much in line with the volume decreases and that's necessary in this business, given the people and people relate is 70% give or take of our total cost structure. So I think we've said here for the last few months any way that we've sort of continued productivity improvements, which we expect to continue to enjoy, like I talked about earlier. We've cut a lot, it's really, really hard to cut a whole lot more. And as we go forward, with the premise that we're expecting to see some modest growth, I think you'll see us, and we actually for the first time, I think here in several quarters, we are up year-over-year with our sales headcount, marketing associates and so on. And so we will add there, and we have been adding there over the last six months or so. But I think the other areas, assuming we see a relatively modest pickup in cases, we still have quite a bit of capacity in our facilities and in our trucks continue to leverage. So I think nothing really changes other than the environment here. So you could expect us to continue to try to drive the earnings faster than the top line.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "And those changes you've made to the marketing associate headcount, do you think they've had time to kind of have an effect on market share or is it still too early?", "William DeLaney", "I think it's a little early. I mean, the thing to keep in mind is even though the net number they've been flatten out for a period of time, we're always refreshing the pool of sales people. So when we're at our best and things are quicking, there's always a percentage of that sales force that's what you might characterize as a training mode. And so the folks that were coming out last year, they're a little bit better than they were last year, a little more experienced [indiscernible] so -- but I would say what we're speaking through here today, that it takes generally, to the honest with you, it takes 18 months to three years for people to fully hit those stride in the sales area.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Could you give us an absolute number on how much the volumes had changed? I mean, we're kind of doing it back of the envelope mass, we think it's maybe around 1%. Is that about right for the volume gain?", "Robert Kreidler", "Mark, we've never really talked about specific volume increases. For the first time, this release we actually indicated whether they were up or down. One of our goals is to try to get to a point where we're comfortable talking about volume increases, but there's some math we've got to play through before we can actually get comfortable releasing that number. There is a number that I know all of you guys get to call the real growth, I guess, which you just take the number that we put out in terms of sales and then you adjust it for the acquisition to ForEx, and the deflation or inflation and you get to a real growth number. I think that's what you were referring to when you got to the 1%. Yes, I mean, I think a lot of you guys do that calculation. You can kind of see the trend in that number. Again, we don't put that in the release because whereby today would be non-GAAP and we can't talk about it.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ajay Jain with Hapoalim Securities.", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "Just in relation to the $0.03 dilution for ERP. Can you confirm the earnings impact in Q3 and what you're anticipating this quarter?", "Robert Kreidler", "No, we're not really talking about it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, Ajay, and that's kind of what we indicated back at the Investor Day. Our goal is to give you an annual impact from that so that you guys can put it into the models, which I know are important to you. Trying to do it quarter-by-quarter is going to be very difficult for us to predict in advance because of the significant timing, things that occurred during the quarter. So we're not doing that today. In the 10-Q, we do actually talk about ERP expense. Well, I'm not sure if it's broken out to ERP expense date, it's probably not. But we do indicate we've spent, I believe, 70% of the range that we gave you.", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "And do you have any comment, Chris, on the lower interest expense and why it was down a little bit sequentially?", "Robert Kreidler", "Yes, we have swaps, which were not employed at this time last year. I didn't actually go back and look at the effective interest rate between this year and the last year. I'm not sure it's significantly different, so I'm guessing that the majority of that difference was the swaps.", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "And I know you guys mentioned that sequentially, the volume trends improved each month in the March quarter, and it sounds like volume trends are still pretty solid through April. So with improving in case volume trends, are you any closer to making the decision for the Indiana RDC because it sounded like a couple months ago that the only thing holding you back was just a more material improvement in demand, so if you can comment.", "William DeLaney", "Ajay, it's Bill. We are, but we're not just quite there yet and the one other factor -- so to your premise you're question, that's exactly right. We were looking to see some meaningful improvement because it's basically the 24-month time period from the time you break ground until you're in full ramp on one of these deals. I won't call it complication, but the other factor that centered the equation here is synchronizing the Midwest RDC with our ERP rollout to those companies that are impacted there. So I don't expect us to break ground this year beyond to be honest with you. But I do expect later in the year to be in a position to be more specific on that. But it's kind of moved off of the volume issue and it's just trying to sync this thing up towards the most efficient relative to how we do the ERP rollout but with our operating companies.", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "And finally, I think you guys made some changes last year on your bonus structure, at least, at the corporate level. So after you factor in the comparisons from last year and the changes in your incentive structure, I'm just wondering how material that impact could be on bonus accruals for this quarter because I'm assuming that the corporate level, the majority of bonuses were still paid out in Q4, is that correct?", "Robert Kreidler", "Well, yes, they're paid out. We accrue from throughout the year. We really didn't make any changes last year, Ajay. Two years ago, we made some changes, relatively modest. We went to return on capital as opposed to return on equity and that type of thing. The thing that hasn't changed is it's pretty much driven on improvement, earnings per share improvement over the prior year, and then the other axis on the grid is a three-year trailing average on returning capital. I think the substantive difference this year is we have earnings improvement, so we would expect to pay our bonuses this year, where as last year, we didn't pay them out at the corporate level.", "Ajay Jain - UBS", "But is it material enough that you think it's appropriate to call out?", "William DeLaney", "Well, we did so...", "Robert Kreidler", "Yes, we've called out the year-over-year change. The absolute amount of it now. I mean, we've been accruing to work periodically, and it doesn't rise to the level of materiality, to be honest.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jason Whitmer with Cleveland Research Company.", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research", "Will, you've absorbed a few more responsibilities over the last quarter so, as Ken is retired, can you might tell me about some strategic, some tactical and maybe some people changes, whether in Houston or in the field that you've been evaluating or executing?", "William DeLaney", "Yes, I'd be happy to, Jay. As you had said, it's not really just -- Ken's retirement, that's a significant event for us here at Sysco. Steve Smith has also announced his retirement. In conjunction with that, we are making some changes. All these changes are effective with the new fiscal year, so where in what I would characterize as a transition period right now. We're also in a period where -- over the last week or two, and in particular the next six to eight weeks, we're very, very focused on doing our profit plans with all of our operating companies, as well as here at corporate. But essentially, what you'll see going forward is Mike Green will take over responsibility for the U.S. Broadline operating companies. Larry Pulliam will continue to oversee contract sales, our distribution services corporate group, as well as SYGMA and our specialty company. So those two gentlemen will be overseeing the business. Reporting in to Mike will be Scott Sonnemaker and Chuck Staes, who currently report in to Mike; and we've added a third gentleman, Mike Headrick, who will oversee our companies in the South. Mike's a longtime Sysco veteran, a very astute business person, we're excited to have Mike step up here. And then in conjunction with that, we've also identified 11 other folks, as well as what we're doing up in Canada, which I would characterize as more market VPs, and this is all new for us, Jay. If you go back, I don't know, I guess 15 years, I think around the mid-'90s, we went to the senior VP of Ops Structure, which was a first for us. And at that time and for many years after that, most of those folks, generally, we have four regions, they might have 15 maybe as many as 20 companies, which was effective but probably not overly manageable in some ways. As you know, in recent years last year to, in particular, we've gone to a more of a pod structure, which I think has been the transition to get us to where we're headed today which is more what I would characterize as a market structure. We're trying to be very customer centric and so with this market structure, we're going to have 11-plus Canada folks overseeing markets, they will not be running operating companies. They'll be working very closely with the operating company presidents in their marketplace to drive out our go-to-market strategy, to effectively implement the 212 business transformation work, to enhance what we're doing on the talent management side of the company, to better develop customer relationships that might crossover local lines, as well as -- and hopefully bring even more effective focus to our acquisition work. So I'm excited about that. It's a new structure and we'll begin to transition into it here as we go into the new year. In addition to that, we've had Kent Humphries, who has done a great job running our Canadian business to pick up expanded responsibilities and Kent's going to report in to Larry, head of our contract sales effort across the country. And Kent brings, not just a lot of experience, but a lot of, frankly, enthusiasm; and energy to that position and tremendous relationships, both within Sysco and with the customer base. In addition to that, Alan Hasty, who currently runs our Cleveland company is going to come down to corporate and work with Bill Day and his group to -- Alan's primary responsibilities will be to work in our BSCC merchandising areas. So we have made several moves, there'll be some more that I'm sure you'll learn of, which will be more replacing some of the folks that we've promoted and those will come out as appropriate over the next couple of months. But essentially, to cut through it all, as we go through these changes, we transition through the retirement of Ken and Steve. I just thought it was appropriate to leverage the talent that we do have in a bigger way and we have a very deep bench in Sysco. We've got a lot of people that are more than capable and want to contribute more, and that's what's behind these changes.", "Jason Whitmer - Cleveland Research", "The shared service announcement, that sounds like if you're doing a separate facility being down in Houston a number of times, it looks like you have a big campus to begin with. But a sep [separate] facility, I'm curious how big is corporate now and how big is the shared services and headcount as you build that from scratch?", "William DeLaney", "Well, we're going to come back to you with the specifics on that, but in the difference between the campus that you seeing which, for the record is two buildings, but it is big and there's plenty of square footage. So hopefully, Jay, it'll be an opportunity for us that we'll have some capacity here over time. But the difference in this facility that we're going to be moving into is it formerly was a call center for another major company and we think it's best suited for our business going forward. It's quite large, it's several hundred thousand square feet and I won't be able to speak to the numbers and all that, I think as we get closer to the end of the calendar year.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "First, just a housekeeping question on fuel costs. I think it was mentioned that it actually was a benefit in this quarter. If you could remind us or tell us how to think about the next six or 12 months? And then second question, maybe a little bit longer, it's just kind of the overall state of the industry in terms of health of competition, if you think most of the competition has gotten out of the woods and is going to benefit from this improving environment or there might be things that I don't understand, and there could be even closures or more share loss of the competition, and whether this is the right environment for you to be looking at acquisitions as we begin the upturn?", "Robert Kreidler", "John, this is Chris. I'll take the fuel costs one first. Fuel costs, we look at it as a net between the cost of fuel and surcharges. On a year-over-year basis, we saw a benefit. The guidance that we've given is we expect the fuel costs to be as much as $50 million to $80 million better than last year, and the fuel surcharge to be about $60 million roughly worse than last year. So net-net, depending on where we fall in that first range, we should see a benefit year-over-year and that's recent guidance. So that's where we thought -- that's where we believe the net fuel charge will wind up for the year.", "William DeLaney", "I think as far as the competitive side, John, look at the improving climates, good for everyone. I mean, it's good for our customers, it's certainly good for us, and I would expect it's good for our competitors now. I think going forward, we're extremely well-positioned to grow and to continue to invest in our business. The one interesting thing as we've talked before with the model for this business is when you're not growing, assuming you can manage your receivables relatively well, you actually don't need a lot of capital unless you're going to expand your business. So when you do grow, that does put some pressure on the working capital. So I think from that standpoint, if we have some competitors out there that are able to grow, then they'll be dealing with that, and I'm sure they'll be able to deal with that. But I don't see a whole lot of change on the competitive environment. On the acquisition angle on that, we keep hoping for angles here and perhaps, a better environment will help us all come to more realistic terms on valuation, some of these situations and people will be more motivated to strike some common ground and evaluation now that the business is beginning to improve. So I think it could be a good thing.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Bob Cummins with Wellington Shields & Co.", "Robert Cummins - Shields & Company", "It strikes me that this is only the beginning. Obviously, your numbers are up a bit over last year, the top line I mean, but it seems -- as we all know, Americans love to eat out, and the environment I think, as it's developing, is going to encourage them to eat out even more. And obviously, from your point of view as a company, you don't have a lot of bodies to your staff as the business increases, you just load more goods on the truck, which is very profitable business. It seems to me that both top line and bottom line results over say, the next four quarters or so should continue to gain substantially year-over-year. Am I right in thinking that? You don't have to comment if you don't want to.", "William DeLaney", "Well, I'll start and let Chris clean it up here a little bit on the financial side. But I think if you take a purely operational point of view, you're exactly right that with an improved environment out there, our customers should see more traffic, and that translates into more opportunity for us to grow and to be more efficient. We've done a nice job, Bob. We've done -- we've been able to grow our pieces per mile and all that type of thing, but it's difficult to grow your pieces per stop when your customers' business is offend. So certainly that would be a metric that we would expect to improve. There's no way of knowing on these things, and if you go back and look at the psychology and over last year, two years, we've kind of struck, I think a reasonable middle ground. We've never said that we thought that the industry was going to just go totally south for an extended period of time. We certainly acknowledge that the last year to two years have been difficult and the industry has declined. I think the reasonable case is it continues to be what we talked about up in New York in December, which is a modest nominal growth for the industry over time, and that would translate to good things for us. There's some below the line things for next year that I think we've called out and that you would need to deal with. And I'll let Chris kind of transition to that conversation.", "Robert Kreidler", "Yes, I hate to be the finance guy that delves this cold water on anything especially since you stated it in such a nice way. I agree with everything Bill said in terms of kind of the medium term, short term, where we're just looking at year-over-year lapse. We've gotten some good benefits this year from COLI, which is not the way you want to make your numbers, obviously, but that's just what's happened in the market. We certainly would not anticipate that type of benefit occurring every year. We've gotten some benefit this year for fuel. We've gotten some benefit year-over-year from bad debt expense. So some of the things we've talked about in these calls as being year-over-year benefit, of course, we can't count on them having those come back in our favor next year. Next year, is the year where we just need to have operating performance, and I'll go back to what you said, the sign book good, the trend book good, and we're very hopeful. Bill alluded earlier that this month, the next month, are doing all of our profit plan for the operating company and we're rolling all that up to see what we really believe we can accomplish next year, and we're all anxious to see what our operators, to post close this to the customers believe. As we roll that up, and then bake it into our one-year forecast with all these items, we'll have a better idea of what 2011 looks like.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "The first is, will you be making an announcement this year about sales for Mother's Day, and I wasn't sure if you did that last year?", "William DeLaney", "I'm sorry, sales from where?", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Mother's Day, you used to make an announcement every year.", "William DeLaney", "Did we do that last year? I don't think we did last year, Meredith.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "No, I don't think so. Do you think you'll do it this year?", "William DeLaney", "Probably not.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And then my final question is just about back to fuel expense. You do hedge in some fashion a certain percentage of it. Can you talk about how much of it is hedged through the end of the year? I was kind of surprised that you had such a big range on the cost, given that you only have one quarter left for the year. So I was wondering is it less hedged now?", "Robert Kreidler", "We do put in place hedges. We essentially hedge a portion of our fuel. When we look at how much the hedge we factor in the fact that a lot of our contract customers whether they'd be SYGMA or contract customers, there's already effectively a hedge in those contracts in terms of the fuel surcharge. So we look at what effectively unhedged, and we go out and we put in place hedges on a substantial portion of that. I think the number is roughly 40% of our overall gallon per hedge. We roll those forward month to month, and that just means that we keep going out another month, another month, another month as we see the need to do that. So we're never completely hedged in terms of real financial hedges in the marketplace. 40% is roughly the number where we've been at. The guidance number comes from several things. One of which is we just don't know what fuel costs are going to do in the next couple of months and so the guidance is still reasonably wide.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Sysco Announces Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Neil Russell", "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010 conference call. On today\u2019s call you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ in a material manner.", "Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ in a material manner from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s SEC filings including, but not limited to, risk factors contained in the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 27, 2009, and in the company\u2019s press release issued earlier this morning.", "As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, our operating results this year included an extra week of operations due to the timing of the last day of our fiscal year. As a result, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 included 14 weeks of operations, compared to the fourth quarter last year, which included 13 weeks. And fiscal year 2010 included 53 weeks of operations, compared to the prior year, which included 52 weeks.", "On the call today, we will discuss year-over-year comparisons that include the impact of the extra week of operations. However, to provide financial results that are more comparable on a year-over-year basis, certain metrics will be provided which remove the estimated impact of the extra week. These adjusted metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures on our Investor Relations website at sysco.com.", "Also, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. Lastly, we ask that you reserve December 2nd on your calendars for our Analyst Day in New York. Additional information will be provided in the next couple of weeks.", "With that out of the way I\u2019ll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to begin this morning by recognizing our management team and all of our associates for both their commitment and hard work. They kept their full attention on servicing our customers and effectively managing expenses throughout a second consecutive challenging year.", "This morning Sysco reported net earnings of $338 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We were pleased to see case volumes once again increase year-over-year. While we have seen no consistent pattern of improvement on a week-to-week basis, we are encouraged by the fact that we have now experienced positive volume comparisons for the past several months.", "In addition, we experienced food cost inflation as measured by the estimated change in our cost of goods during the fourth quarter for the first time in a year. Specifically, inflation contributed approximately 2.2% of our overall sales growth for the quarter, driven mainly by higher prices in the dairy, meat and produce categories.", "I\u2019m particularly pleased with how well our operating companies continue to manage their expenses. Along with supporting the growth of our customers, improving our operational effectiveness remains a key area of focus throughout Sysco. While industry conditions are more favorable than they were a year ago, our marketplace remains highly competitive. This environment has increased pricing pressures which we have and will continue to work through with our customers.", "Specifically, we focus our efforts on differentiating our product and service offerings, more effectively utilizing our scale to better integrate our enterprise-wide capabilities and reducing our cost structure overtime. We believe that we\u2019ve been able to take share as a result of these efforts.", "Reflecting on the entire fiscal year, we sold more than $37 billion of product, shipped more than 1.2 billion cases, generated $2 billion of operating income, recognized record earnings of $1.99 per diluted share, produced cash flow from operations of $885 million and distributed $580 million of dividends to our shareholders.", "Turning to our multi-year business transformation initiative for a moment, we currently have more than 300 people dedicated full-time to the project. Over the past two years, we have completed much of the design and technology development work and are currently testing systems and processes. The project that we track and we currently expect our first operating company to go live early next calendar year.", "Subsequent rollouts will occur in waves of 5 to 10 operating companies through the end of 2013. This project is the single most important initiative we have undertaken since the formation of Sysco. As previously communicated, we are investing significant amounts of financial and human capital to better position Sysco for profitable sales growth for years to come. We will continue provide periodic updates as we move forward with the work.", "On last quarter\u2019s call, we discussed the new operational leadership structure we were preparing to put in place. Mike Green is now leading the U.S. Broadline companies and Larry Pulliam is overseeing Contract Sales, Sigma, Distribution Services and the Specialty companies. Additionally, we have recently realigned our U.S. Broadline leadership responsibilities into 11 geographic markets. These changes became effective with the beginning of our new fiscal year.", "This new structure enhances our go-to-market strategy, allows us to more effectively implement our business transformation project, helps us develop and strengthen customer relationships across over local lines and improves our approach to building our pipeline of acquisitions. In addition, the new organization structure provides a broader platform to further develop our most talented and experienced leaders now and in future.", "I would like to close my prepared comments this morning in the same manner in which I began, by thanking our 46,000 associates for their efforts and engagement over the past year. While encouraged by volume trends that continue to be favorable, we recognize that the broader economic climate may remain tenuous for some time.", "Accordingly, we are committed to aggressively deploying all of Sysco\u2019s resources and capabilities moving forward to effectively support our customers and fully realize the opportunities available to us in the $200 billion food service industry.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. What I\u2019d like to do first this morning is provide a brief summary of the formal GAAP results. These GAAP results include the impact of the extra week of operations that Neil mentioned earlier. That means these numbers compare 14 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 53 weeks of operations in fiscal 2010 to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009.", "On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, sales were $10.3 billion, an increase of 13.9% compared to the prior year and operating income was $584 million, an increase of 8.1% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $338 million, an increase of 7.1% and earnings per share were $0.57, compared to $0.53 in the prior year or an increase of 7.5%.", "On a GAAP basis for the year, sales were $37.2 billion, an increase of 1.1% compared to the prior year and operating income was $2 billion, an increase of 5.5% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $1.2 billion, an increase of 11.7%. Earnings per share were $1.99 compared to $1.77 in the prior year or an increase of 12.4%.", "As I mentioned, those year-over-year comparisons on a GAAP basis are not comparable because that extra week of operations in the fourth quarter impacts all the year-over-year comparison. So what I\u2019d like to do now is discuss our results for the quarter and year excluding the impact of that extra week. That means these adjusted numbers compare 13 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 52 weeks of operations in fiscal 2010 to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009. This should give you a better sense for what\u2019s going on in our business and is the same basis the management team has been using to analyze our financial results.", "On an adjusted basis for the quarter, sales increased 5.8% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 2.2% for the period. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 1.3%.", "Adjusted operating income was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, increasing only 0.4%. Adjusted operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter by $76 million. The increase was primarily due to $30 million charge related to Corporate Owned Life Insurance or COLI and $29 million in higher incentive compensation expense.", "Bonus accruals were lower last year in the fourth quarter because we did not meet all our 2009 performance objectives. However, based on the financial results announced today, we met certain 2010 performance objectives and have accrued for bonuses accordingly. Additionally, gross margin was slightly lower, which we largely attribute to the pricing pressure as Bill mentioned earlier.", "Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were $314 million and were essentially flat compared to the prior year, declining less than $2 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.53, including a $0.02 negative impact from COLI. In the prior year period, earnings per share were also $0.53, but included a $0.03 positive impact from COLI.", "Turning to the year-over-year comparisons, while sales declined 0.9% for the year on an adjusted basis, it really was a year with two distinctly different halves. The first half of the year was marked by deflationary pressures across most food categories and case volumes that were negative year-over-year. Consequently, sales in the first half were down 5.7%.", "However, in the second half of the year, deflation moderated and turned inflationary while case volumes began to increase year-over-year. As a result, sales in the second half of the year increased 4.1%.", "Throughout the year we managed our costs very aggressively with particular focus on pay related costs. At the end of the fiscal year, headcount was down 2.2%, demonstrating this progress. This is on top of the 6% reduction achieved in fiscal 2009.", "Our sales per employee has increased 1.3% this year and 5.7% over the last two years. We continue to implement and see benefits from our various operating initiatives, which helped us leverage more of our sales to the bottom line.", "Adjusted operating expenses declined $132 million or 2.6% in fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of more than $70 million reduction in fuel expense, a $65 million favorable change related to COLI and a $40 million decline in bad debt expense.", "These decreases were partially offset by a $37 million increase in company\u2019s sponsored pension expense. As a result, adjusted operating income increased $62 million or 3.3% to $1.9 billion for the fiscal year.", "Adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2010 were $1.2 billion, an increase of $100 million or 9.5% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $1.95, aided by a $0.05 tax benefit related to the company\u2019s IRS settlement announced in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and a $0.04 favorable impact from COLI.", "EPS in the prior year period was $1.77, which included a $0.07 negative impact from COLI. This is the end of our discussion of the results of operations on a non-GAAP basis. Comments from here forward in the call reflect GAAP amounts.", "Turning to a brief discussion or brief update on our business transformation initiative, the project decreased diluted EPS this fiscal year by approximately $0.02. This resulted lower than the $0.03 estimate we provided on our third quarter call, due primarily to timing and our ability to capitalize more cost than anticipated.", "Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $885 million, compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year period. Cash flow from operations in the current period was impacted by IRS settlement payment totaling $528 million and early pension contribution payment for fiscal 2011 totaling $140 million.", "We now paid more than half of the total IRS settlement amount and will pay approximately $212 million per year in fiscal 2011 and 2012 to the pave of our normal estimated tax payments. Due to the timing of those tax payments during our fiscal years, there is no cash impact on our first quarter, fiscal quarter of either year, $106million cash outflow in each second quarter period and a $53 million cash flow in each of the third and fourth fiscal quarters.", "Capital expenditures totaled $157 million for the quarter and $595 million for the year in line with our guidance. Spending for the year included investments in technology including our business transformation project, fleet replacement and purchase of a facility for our future shared services operation and replacement or expansion of facilities in Vancouver, Toronto, Houston, Philadelphia and Plainfield, New Jersey.", "In July, we announced the acquisition of Lincoln Poultry & Egg Company in an all cash deal. Lincoln Poultry serves more than 800 customers located mainly within the central United States and generates approximately $200 million in annual revenues.", "We believe that their high quality operations and strong customer relationships will be an excellent growth opportunity for Sysco. As discussed previously, we continue to be active in the acquisition market, working to identify opportunities that we believe may be a good fit for us.", "Looking ahead into next year, there are a couple of important items that we want you to keep in mind as you think about fiscal 2011. First, fiscal 2011 will be a 52-week year. The 53-week anomaly we had in fiscal 2010 occurs every six years. The next year we have this issue again will be in fiscal year 2016. And second, we recognized certain gains during the year to be mindful of, a one-time tax benefit of $29 million in the first quarter of this year related to our IRS settlement and $22 million in total gains related to COLI that impacted operating income throughout the year.", "In addition, we are also providing a few guidance metrics for the year ahead. We expect capital spending for fiscal 2011 to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million as we continue to invest in our business, including $160 million to $180 million of capital related to our business transformation project.", "We expect pension expense for the year to be approximately $60 million higher than fiscal 2010. This increase is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine pension expense, which is in turn driven by the significant decline in long-term interest rates over the last year.", "Finally, we estimate the net impact of the business transformation project will reduce EPS by $0.06 to $0.09. This range is a bit lower than the projections we provided last December at our Investor Day and is primarily attributable to our ability to capitalize more of the cost of the project.", "In closing, while the business environment in fiscal 2010 was challenging, our operating companies did a great job of managing through those challenges with a strong focus on growing cases, reducing costs and improving productivity. That focus has continued into the New Year and we are confident that Sysco is well positioned to successfully address the new challenges and opportunities that we will experience in fiscal 2011.", "With that, operator, we will now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question today from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks very much. First question I would like to ask is just, if you could talk a little bit more about the competitive environment. You talked about a lot of pricing pressures. Could you just maybe elaborate on that a little bit?", "Bill DeLaney", "Good morning, Meredith. This is Bill. Yeah, it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve been talking about it really for the better part of a year, I guess. And what we\u2019re seeing out there is I think what you\u2019re seeing across all the spectrum of the economy right now. Our customers are doing everything they can to improve their service to their customers and at the same time manage their bottom line more effectively and part of the equation is to get more people in their restaurants and part of it is managing cost. So we\u2019re regularly working with customers on how to do that.", "As I mentioned in my comments, we tend to focus largely on differentiating ourselves and giving them a lot of the value added services that we talked about in the past. From a pricing standpoint, I think probably about this time a year ago was when it really I think went to another level and it continues to be quite competitive out there.", "So as you know and as we\u2019ve talked before, the way we manage the business here is we obviously focus on the top line and then we focus on the bottom line and then we try to manage our expenses in a way that will leverage that and at the same time offset any gross margin pressures we may see.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Great. And then I just have another question, maybe if you could talk about sales. Is there anything that you can point out, either regionally or type of customer, where you\u2019re seeing either the greatest improvement or the least improvement, anything that kind of stands out?", "Bill DeLaney", "Yeah. We look at that. Now, we\u2019ve got all different ways to slice and dice it here with the new organizational structure and we look at it weekly and monthly and quarterly and it would be -- I would be hard-pressed to tell you there\u2019s any one region that\u2019s particularly outperforming another or -- Florida continues to be difficult. This is going on for years now. Hopefully, we\u2019re going to start seeing some improvement down there.", "But I can\u2019t really tell you geographically that there\u2019s a big trend or variability one way or another. As far as the customer mix, that\u2019s an interesting question because as with all numbers, whether you\u2019re talking about your earnings or your sales or your margins or your mix, you\u2019ve got to look at where you were last year and where you are now. So there are different views out there in terms of what the industry is seeing. I would say that we\u2019re seeing about the same performance both on the QSRs, we\u2019re seeing on, say, the meat companies as what we\u2019re seeing on the more family-oriented dining with our Broadliners but for different reasons.", "QSR, I think those numbers seems to be performing quite well right now but the top line comparisons are a little tougher than a year ago. On the meat company side, we\u2019ve had two really, really hard years there. As you can appreciate, the bulk of that business is, at least a large percentage of it is high end and that\u2019s been very difficult segment of the market.", "Our numbers are actually starting to improve there albeit off of two tough years. And then in the family dining, I\u2019d say pretty much mirrors the market. So at least from our perspective, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of changes but part of that is the baseline.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Next, we\u2019ll hear from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning. Want to follow up on the question on competition. Just when you think about the source or when you ask about the source of your operators, is this other competitors coming in with just lower pricing or is it more chains and maybe even some of the bigger independents, let say, or what have you, actually kind of bidding it out, calling up and saying we need relief, let\u2019s try to create an option for our business?", "Bill DeLaney", "Well, Andy, I think it\u2019s both of those. They tend to be interrelated but it\u2019s more than that. I mean, it\u2019s also us understanding the depth of the relationships we have with our customers and understanding that even though the environment is better than it was a year ago. It\u2019s still very tough environment out there for any business and so we spend a lot of time, invests a lot of resources both with our Street customers and our contract customers to stay close to them and understand what their needs are and try to be as proactive as we can.", "So in fairness, is there more of that, what you described probably going on today than there was a couple years ago, probably, and are we dealing with it effectively? I think so. But the reality is, this business is always very competitive and the margins are relatively slim. So it\u2019s a combination of us being proactive and then in certain situations reacting to the specific needs of our customers, which tend to be precipitated by the competition.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Thanks. So I mean, let\u2019s say we\u2019re in a new economy that doesn\u2019t really have a robust rebound. Do you think the attributes of demand for food service distribution might have shifted more towards the price and away from quality and reliability or could, theoretically have shifted if things don\u2019t pick up?", "Bill DeLaney", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a shift. I mean, I think it\u2019s just a deeper or more acute emphasis but certainly in terms of how we look at the business, both from ourselves and as we work with customers, if you don\u2019t have a topline, it\u2019s very difficult to leverage anything. So certainly you want to make sure your product costs are in line and that your operating costs, you need to continue to get more productive and more efficient.", "But I don\u2019t think you ever want to move away from what the customer expects relative to your particular eating establishment. So service will continue we think to be very, very important. I think it starts there and -- but with that said, we are in a slower growth environment. We understand that and that\u2019s why you see us both in the short-term over the last few years as well strategically, be very focused on reducing our cost structure over time, that will give us more latitude to continue to compete well.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "And just last follow-up on the sales environment. It strengthened at least for the quarter and I understand you\u2019re saying the weeks, week by week, it\u2019s still somewhat erratic and I understand that to mean. Your customers are obviously having variable results and so forth. But if you look at it on a monthly basis and include July because the advanced sales from commerce looked pretty good for July, is there any discernable pattern? Obviously, I\u2019m trying to see if it\u2019s up or sideways, can\u2019t be down I suppose -- could be down, I guess. But are you seeing any signs of strengthening when you look for the quarter through July?", "Bill DeLaney", "Andy, I think what we\u2019re trying to address in those comments was we\u2019ve had several months now going back. I think if you look at last year, Chris talked about two halves, let\u2019s break it into thirds. I mean, the first third we were in pretty deep dive both on the case volume and on the deflation. And we started to see that turn in November and then it did turn in December and last several months.", "So we\u2019re continuing to see case growth even into July. We continue to see comparable inflation. The point we\u2019re trying to make there is what we haven\u2019t seen is kind of a step-up in that rate of growth and we would like to see that but the reality is we haven\u2019t seen that, from week to week, it will move around and that could be as simple as just how the calendar falls.", "So the point we\u2019re just trying to sensitize it to, it\u2019s choppy but it\u2019s definitely still positive. And to your point there are mixed messages that are coming out of the industry trade right now.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Thanks and that\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citi", "Great. Thanks. And just as a follow-up on the sales question, obviously very, very robust volumes relative to how the economy is doing. Market share have anything to do with versus your other distribution competitors?", "Bill DeLaney", "Greg, could you repeat that?", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citi", "Are you seeing market share gains driving that acceleration in the real sales volume or is it strictly kind of the overall market kind of lifting?", "Bill DeLaney", "No, we look at it -- first of all, let say, it\u2019s hard to precisely answer that question. The industry numbers continue to get updated but we think which tends to be where we go for a lot of our perspective. We think you\u2019re going to see a second year that\u2019s down. So you\u2019re looking at two years where the industry has been down. And we\u2019re flattish to maybe up a little bit, depending how you look at the numbers.", "So we think we\u2019re taking share, it\u2019s just hard to get too aggressive with that comment when the industry is down like that. So no, we\u2019re taking share on a relative basis and we believe if you look at the industry information that people are in the medium term a little more optimistic than they were six or 12 months ago for future growth of the market, although in the short term it\u2019s not so clear.", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Good. And then just with the recent acquisition of Lincoln Poultry & Egg, maybe a little bit more color around that, kind of how you think that\u2019s going to do for you?", "Bill DeLaney", "I think it\u2019s a very traditional type of Sysco acquisition. It\u2019s in a market where we have good market presence but this is a real good company with a good management team. And we think it\u2019s going to complement what we\u2019re doing out there in the Midwest very well.", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citi", "Great. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Move on to Jason Whitmer with Cleveland Research Company.", "Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Good morning. Bill, I want to come back a little bit to your pricing pressure versus trend comment, seems like competitively not a whole lot\u2019s different today than maybe over the last 12 months. But maybe could you provide some thoughts on the swing in inflation as it relates to pricing power?", "So looks like the 2.2% is fully product cost but how much of that has been realized? Is that what you\u2019re talking about is more of a pinch there in the spread between what you\u2019re experiencing in wholesale versus what is getting passed through?", "Bill DeLaney", "You know, Jay, that could be part of it. I purposefully didn\u2019t go there just from the standpoint of -- that\u2019s a very hard phenomenon to qualify. We\u2019ve talked about that in the past. So I think what you\u2019re getting as -- when you move from a deflationary environment, which -- while that hurts you on your gross profit dollars, it tends to actually help you to some extent on your percentages.", "And you move into some nice inflation that we are seeing now that could pull the pressure. There\u2019s a lot of things that obviously impact margins, various components of margin in terms of mix, the product mix, the business mix, the customer mix, all that type of thing, what the numbers were last year.", "So I think that could be part of it. But I think in the broadest sense in terms of giving you a feel for what we\u2019re seeing out there, I think it\u2019s somewhat of a cumulative build to what we\u2019ve seen over the last year, just the marketplace where there\u2019s just -- everyone\u2019s trying to grow and they\u2019re trying to -- more than anything they\u2019re trying to make money. So I think that\u2019s the bulk of it.", "Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "I think where there\u2019s some confusion, this would have made more sense two or three or four quarters ago, when sales were under pressure, where there\u2019s more customer product mix shift. And now that sales are good and margins as face value look worse, so I\u2019m hoping you can reconcile either the timing of all that or maybe more importantly, we\u2019re trying to get our hands around as where this goes over the next six months, 12 months, within some of those core components, whether competitive or not but core components of your business, are there any real inflations to be watching here or is there something structurally building here before we even get to the SAP expense dollars.", "Bill DeLaney", "That\u2019s fair. I accept the question. I think, look, the margins are a little bit like momentum. They\u2019re out there and so while the pressures have been out there for a year or so, it takes a while for some of that pressure to work its way through the system and even though -- let\u2019s say half of our business is Street business and that tends to get priced on a daily or weekly basis, the other half is not. It\u2019s contractual and those types of fluctuations tend to take a little longer to work their way through the system.", "So I think part of it is a time lag that one would expect over a period of time. And then part of it is just how we manage our business. I mean, if you\u2019re running a Sysco operating company or if you\u2019re running Sysco, you look at your top line, you try to figure out how you\u2019re going to grow your bottom line and we\u2019re very focused on the fact that we know it\u2019s competitive out there. We know we need to fight hard to continue to earn the business of our existing customers and to grow with them and hopefully attract new customers.", "So I think a lot of it\u2019s just more the environment. I can\u2019t tell you that -- I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a structural change. It\u2019s still a relatively modest -- I think we\u2019re off about a quarter of a point for the quarter. We\u2019re flat for the year. But I would acknowledge, I think you could see some margin pressure here over the next couple quarters.", "Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "That\u2019s fair. When you look forward a little bit further out, I know you\u2019re trying to tackle 50 basis points of margin expansion just on the core and another 50 from SAP over time, but where and when should we start to see, looking for those to develop? Is that something that could be tangible here in the next 12 months or is that still more of a three or four year time horizon?", "Bill DeLaney", "I\u2019m going to let Chris jump in on that one.", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah. I\u2019ll jump in. and what you\u2019re referring to is, I think, is going back to our Investor Day Presentation where we talked about, basically a point of margin improvement, half of which would be our traditional initiatives, productivity improvements and half of which would come from ERP.", "Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Correct.", "Chris Kreidler", "The valid answer to that is as we roll out the tools with ERP, we\u2019ll start seeing those improvements. We\u2019re at the very, very early stages of starting to roll out things like Sysco market, eSysco, things of that nature, so over the next 12 months you might see -- we might see bits and pieces of it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be significant enough to flow through to the numbers that you all see. I think it\u2019s more likely 24 to 36 months before we start to see that impact as we outlined in our timetable.", "Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Chris, are you talking more about the SAP specific benefits from that or is there another component just on the core blocking and tackling separate from that?", "Chris Kreidler", "I\u2019m referring more to the SAP stuff. The core blocking and tackling what we refer to is the step that we are always working on. And I think we spoke about the initiatives that were already underway that we just hadn\u2019t fully rolled out and then new initiatives, I think we talked about that points and some other things that we had barely touched upon yet that will be rolled out over time. Those are the types of things that are always ongoing that we use to offset the normal increases, that we seen in our price structure, cost structure.", "Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Bill DeLaney", "Hey, Jason. This is Bill. Just to add here, because certainly the questions are on point. There\u2019s a lot of numbers in this quarter\u2019s release and Chris has done a great job taking you through some of the chunkiness of it, but I would just point out that while there is some ladies legitimate margin pressure out there and we are certainly are acknowledging that, but when you adjust for the week and adjust for the COLI, we\u2019re very pleased with the quality of the earnings growth at the operating level this quarter.", "Jason Whitmer \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Great. Thanks.", "Bill DeLaney", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Move on to Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. With the case volumes steadily improving, where do you stand on the redistribution centers at this point?", "Bill DeLaney", "Yeah, we\u2019re more optimistic, obviously. We did defer moving forward in the Midwest because a big part of that business case is generated by anticipated case growth. So we\u2019re close to moving forward there. Haven\u2019t quite pulled together all the administrative things that we need to do. But we\u2019re prepared to move forward here hopefully next year and we\u2019ll come back to you on that in the Midwest and that\u2019s a very key third leg now in the RDC initiative.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And just to get at your point that costs were managed well this year, are you finding any new opportunities for cost cutting as you\u2019re going through the SAP processor process or is that kind of already reflected in your comment that 24 to 36 months away, we\u2019ll start to see some cost improvement.", "Chris Kreidler", "I\u2019ll jump in on that. I think as we go through the ERP implementation process, if you just back up and think about what we are doing, we are redesigning all of the processes by which we conduct our business. Did we get them all down on paper, when we first started the initiative? No. So as we pursue this and go through the process of implementing the change, I think it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re finding new stuff that we can go to work on and new places where we might be able to do things either more efficiently or less expensively.", "Do they amount to a significantly increased savings amount compared to our business case? No. But the answer to your question is I think we\u2019re always finding new ways to save and improve as we go through this process. But again, we\u2019re redesigning our business kind of from the ground up.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then maybe putting SAP aside, you were moving forward and rehiring MAs. How does that stand and should we be looking for costs to gradually be up in percentage terms this year or what should we be thinking about for our SG&A numbers?", "Bill DeLaney", "I\u2019ll start and let Chris clean it up here a little bit, so. On the SG&A side, we would continue to expect to leverage those numbers to the extent that we get sales growth. So to the specific question, MAs, we are up year-over-year on MAs and that was something that we had fallen behind on.", "But I would tell you this because the only area that we see any meaningful headcount increase for the new year, given the levels of volume we\u2019re seeing today, would be on the sales and marketing side. So we would certainly expect to leverage the SG&A line. Now, with that, I mean, we have cut quite hard here over the last two years in terms of headcount. So we do need to see some growth to attain that leverage.", "Chris Kreidler", "I\u2019ll just jump in and add. I was doing some quick numbers last night. From Q4 of this year looking back two years to Q4 of 2008, our headcount is down just shy of 4,000, close to 8%. And that includes the fact that we have now started rehiring MAs. And so our MA headcount has actually started to grow back in the last couple quarters.", "So I\u2019ll echo Bill\u2019s comment. I think the company did exactly what it needed to do, given where cases were going and where the economy was going. We cut very hard and appropriately. We started hiring MAs back because we do believe the market\u2019s turning and we are starting to see case growth. At some point, we will have to give serious consideration to whether we start hiring back in some other areas as well to prepare ourselves for larger amounts of business and growth.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next, we\u2019ll hear from Neil Currie with UBS.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "Thanks for answering the questions. Just wanted to just clarify on the gross margin decline, when you say that the decline was all price or was there anything else in there?", "Bill DeLaney", "It\u2019s never all price, obviously. Not to be too much of an accountant. But it\u2019s your cost of goods and your price. So it\u2019s both and it\u2019s also mix in terms of the product mix and the customer mix. So there\u2019s a little bit of all that but I would say a lot of it is on the pricing side.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thanks. And just in terms of you\u2019re starting to see inflation compared to last quarter starting to pick up now. Could you just go into which categories you\u2019re seeing the strongest price increases and perhaps comment on your ability to pass through these price increases and where do you see this going over the next six months ago also?", "Bill DeLaney", "I\u2019ll take the first part because that\u2019s easier and we\u2019ll open it up here to the second part. We\u2019re actually at a pretty nice level right now. 2%, as we said historically, we\u2019ve seen it all here over the last several years. We\u2019ve seen deflation. We saw a lot of inflation for a good while and then we saw deflation.", "If we could maintain a relatively constant environment of 2, maybe 3 points of inflation, that tends to work for our customers. It works for us and our systems and that type of thing and that\u2019s about where we are right now. The particular categories I think we mentioned, where we\u2019re seeing the most inflation right now would be in the -- I think it\u2019s in dairy and meat area and the produce area.", "Now, the second part of your question is a much tougher one to answer in terms of where it\u2019s going. Some of the phenomenon that is going on with wheat prices and what that might mean within the food chain over time.", "So you\u2019re hearing people talk about deflation in terms of the broader economy on one hand and then perhaps a lot of inflation in some of the commodities on the other and right now we haven\u2019t experienced that. Our inflation report for July was comparable to what we saw for the quarter. But we\u2019ll have to watch that very closely. Chris, you want to add anything to that?", "Chris Kreidler", "No. I mean, you all are seeing the press releases from other companies that are warning about commodity prices over the next quarter or two. We read the same stuff and so if all that comes to bear, we\u2019ll have some inflationary pressure but our source is about the same as yours.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "In terms of how you\u2019ll handle that, we just look to pass through or wait to see how customers feel about it? Or is a lot of this just contractual?", "Bill DeLaney", "Some of it is contractual to your points or some of that will roll on a weekly and some on a monthly basis. On the street side, we just work through it with customers like we do any sales or marketing opportunities, so. But generally, like I said, when you\u2019re at lower levels, it\u2019s something they can handle more than what we were seeing a couple years ago when we were at 6 or 8% inflation.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thanks very much and congratulations on the underlying results.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) You will now hear from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi. Thanks. Just, first a quick clarification, on the ERP and EPS investment in fiscal \u201811 I think you said, Chris, $0.06 to $0.09.", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "Is that incremental relative to \u201810 or in total?", "Chris Kreidler", "When we use the term incremental, what we\u2019re basically saying is that $0.06 to $0.09 of additional cost that we would not otherwise incur where we not doing the ERP implementation. You would then take that number, whatever it is, between $0.06 to $0.09 and compare it to $0.02 which is what we reported this year and that\u2019s the year-over-year change.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Great. That\u2019s what I thought. And secondly, in terms of -- I guess some of the restructure, if you will, of the operating companies with some regional supervision and I think, Bill, you mentioned in terms of -- that that would give you, A, it would give you better look for some acquisitions but also serve customers across geographies. Of course I immediately think about change. Do you think that there are any chains or might that become a more strategically important over time to add some big chunks of business that might currently reside with some of your competition on the chain side?", "Bill DeLaney", "Well, we believe we certainly have opportunity on the contract sales side. With that said, the Street business is very, very important part of our business model, so we need to focus on both. But to your point, what we\u2019re really saying to you there is, we believe, whether it\u2019s regional chains or national chains where maybe more of a market type of emphasis within that group, these are sometimes big groups.", "We think just having the type of people that we put in these jobs were highly experienced, very accomplished people within Sysco, many of them have a very strong sales background. We certainly think the customer and the sales opportunity is something we can capitalize there, along with the acquisition. But it\u2019s also an opportunity, when you\u2019ve gotten as large as we have and as geographically disperse, I think that level of management will allow some of us to stay focused on the key drivers to the business over time.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Neil Russell", "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco\u2019s first quarter 2011 conference call. On today\u2019s call you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

If you haven\u2019t already registered, please do so prior to November 22.", "With that out of the way, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thanks Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning Sysco reported net earnings of $299 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Our sales in the first quarter increased 7.4%, driven mainly by increased case volume and estimated food cost inflation of 3.3%.", "Case volume was higher across all regions in our Broadline and SYGMA segments and the year-over-year increased represented the strongest improvement since the second quarter of fiscal 2007.", "While the pace of the macroeconomic recovery remains sluggish and restaurant traffic patterns continue to be under pressure, recent data suggests the industry is slowly recovering. Sysco\u2019s gradual but consistent improvement in case volume confirms this trend and we believe we are continuing to grow our market share.", "We are pleased with our sales growth for the quarter and I should also note that we achieved record first quarter operating income. Nevertheless operating income growth over the prior year was less than our sales increase as improved expense management was more than offset by a 46 basis point decline in gross margin percent.", "Several factors contributed to the decline in gross margins. Approximately 10 points of the margin decline related to a change in business mix. While both our Broadline and SYGMA businesses grew this quarter, SYGMA grew at a faster rate and since SYGMA operates a lower margin business, this mix shift impacted total margins.", "We do not view this as a negative outcome. As a matter of fact, we see a great deal of opportunity on the contract side of the business, both from the Broadline and SYGMA segments. The key is to strike an appropriate balance between street and contract sales growth over time.", "The remainder of the gross margin decline was split about evenly between two drivers. The first is a set of ongoing strategic pricing initiatives designed to drive volume increases in targeted categories.", "While these initiatives are putting near-term pressure on our margins, we are starting to see double-digit volume increases where these programs have been effectively implemented. We expect this specific pressure on gross margins will persist in the near-term, but we also believe these initiatives will result in profitable market share gains over time.", "The last component of the gross margin decline relates to the significant raise of inflation in the meat, dairy and sea food categories which together approached 10%. While we typically are able to pass through modest levels of price inflation on a timely basis, it is more difficult in the short-term to pass through double digit price increases to our customers without negatively impacting their business.", "Our ongoing productivity initiatives helped to mitigate a portion of the gross margin pressure with U.S. Broadline warehouse cases per man hour and cases per trip increasing compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. In addition, total sales per employee also increased year-over-year.", "All that said, while operating performance in the first quarter is acceptable, it\u2019s not up to our standards. We recently held our annual senior leadership meeting at which the importance of profitable sales growth was thoroughly discussed. Our management team understands that we must find ways to grow our earnings faster than sales during these challenging times.", "Turning to our multi-year business transformation initiative for a moment, the project remains on track. We are preparing to begin the last of our four cycles of testing prior to go live with our pilot facility early next year.", "We\u2019re also beginning to staff Sysco business services and have recently named Kirk Drummond to lead this strategically important part of our business. Kirk has been with Sysco for the last 24 years working in various capacities at our local operating companies and at corporate including five years as our Chief Information Officer and the last five years as our Senior Vice President and Treasurer.", "This organization will centralize back office administrative functions such accounting, receivables, payables, billing and call center support.", "I\u2019d like to close by thanking our associates and our management team for their ongoing contributions and commitment to Sysco\u2019s success. This is an excitement time in our company\u2019s history and our associates continue to deliver a high level service and support to our customers.", "While our business is facing certain challenges, we remain dedicated to being our customers\u2019 most valued business partner and to investing in the future growth of Sysco. We know this focus strengthens our competitive position and provides the strong foundation for success over the long-term.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $9.8 billion, or an increase of 7.4% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by case volume growth and the impact of food cost inflation which we estimate to be 3.3% for the period.", "In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.6% and changes in foreign exchange rate increased sales by 0.5%.", "Operating income increased $9 million or 1.8% to $506 million during the quarter. While sales increased 7.4%, gross margin increased only 4.8% and operating expense increased 6%.", "Operating expense increased $75 million for the quarter due to three main drivers. First, salaries and related expense increased approximately $40 million, primarily from increased case volume during the quarter, including increased commissions and incentives and delivery personnel costs.", "Total headcount was down very slightly compared to the prior year, meaning we held our headcount levels relatively steady despite increased case volume. While total headcount is down, we\u2019ve increased MA headcount over the last year.", "It typically takes one year to two years for an MA to be fully productive within the sales organization, but we consider this investment in the business to be an important one that will enhance our ability to grow sales as the industry recovers and continue to take market share.", "Second, as we had discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, pension expense increased by $15 million year-over-year. Lastly, operating expense included a $14 million benefit from the impact of Corporate Owned Life Insurance or COLI, which is an unfavorable comparison to the $21 million benefit we recorded in the prior year.", "Net earnings for the first quarter were $299 million, declining $27 million or 8.3% compared to the prior year. Net earnings reflect a $39 million year-over-year increase in tax expense, primarily due to the IRS settlement gain and higher non-taxable COLI gains recorded in the prior year.", "Excluding the impact of COLI in both periods and the IRS settlement gain, net earnings for the quarter as adjusted would have increased 3.4%. In addition the $15 million year-over-year increase in pension expense impacted net earnings by another 2.8 percentage points.", "Earnings per share declined 7.3% to $0.51, which included a $0.02 benefit from COLI. In the prior year period, earnings per share were $0.55, and included a $0.05 gain related to the IRS settlement and a $0.04 benefit from COLI.", "Turning to cash flow; cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $227 million compared to $42 million in the prior year. Cash flow from operations increased year-over-year due mainly to the timing of our IRS settlement payments. During the first quarter of this year we had no settlement payments, however in the prior year period we paid $316 million.", "We expect to pay a total of $212 million in settlement payments during this fiscal year and again next year. As a reminder, these scheduled payments include $106 million cash outflow in the second quarter period and a $53 million cash outflow in the third and fourth fiscal quarters.", "Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted during the quarter by an increase in accounts receivable and a decline in accrued expense. Receivables increased due to higher sales during the period, and the decline in accrued expenses this quarter was due mainly to the payment of incentive compensation related to the prior fiscal year.", "Capital expenditures totaled $143 million for the quarter including facility expansion and replacement, fleet replacements, and investments in technology including our business transformation project.", "In closing, while the business environment remains challenging, we\u2019re seeing improvements and our operating companies continue to have a strong focus on growing cases, controlling costs, improving productivity, and successfully implementing our business transformation. As a result, we are confident that Sysco is well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery as it takes hold.", "With that operator, we will now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Ajay Jain with Hapoalim Securities.", "Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities", "Hi, good morning. I just wanted to clarify a few things on the gross margin impact during the quarter. I think some of that decline I am sure is a little bit cosmetic because of the inflation impact And Bill, I think you already talked about the mix shift between SYGMA and Broadline, but as far as the strategic price investments that I think you cited in your press release, it seems at least to me a little bit unprecedented for Sysco to have to resort to discounting based on the way you guys have typically gone to market. So can you just talk about how far reaching these price investments are going to be over the rest of the year, and if you had to quantify how much of the 46 basis point decline was driven by price investments in this last quarter, is that something that you can quantify at all?", "Bill DeLaney", "I\u2019ve given my best shot, and we\u2019ll see where we end up here. So to repeat, of the 46 basis point decline we think about 10 basis point of that is the business mix of SYGMA versus the Broadline. So that leaves you a little over a third of a point of margin decline. Our best estimate is about half of that is we would attribute to pretty significant inflation in those three categories. I mentioned meat, dairy and seafood, and the other half I don\u2019t know I\u2019d call discounting or pricing so much as what we would characterize is as what we said is strategic category initiatives.", "Where we see opportunities, Ajay, where we are somewhat underpenetrated and we think it\u2019s appropriate for us to get a little more focused and get a little more finely priced in those categories. So we\u2019ve been into this year for a few months and I would expect that to continue here over a good portion of the balance of the year, but it\u2019s not a random type of thing. Its distinct categories and we\u2019re doing it in different parts of the country and over time throughout the country, and again, I would expect us to maybe not in 12 months, but over a reasonable period of time see it pay back there on the sales line.", "Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities", "So going forward, would the gross margin implications from these category management initiatives, with the magnitude be similar to this latest quarter?", "Bill DeLaney", "It\u2019s actually hard to predict. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of things that go in the gross margin, Ajay, but I would say, for this piece of the pie so to speak, I think as we said and I think as I said in the narrative, I expect the pressure to continue here for at least a couple more quarters. With that said, I think there\u2019s other things we can manage better including the inflation part and that\u2019s what we were alluding to in terms of our discussions with our management team. There is opportunities for us to manage this inflation environment somewhat better.", "Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities", "Just this one quick follow-up on the tax rate, I know there\u2019s some variability each quarter based on stock compensation and COLI, but could you talk about what you\u2019re assuming as far as a normalized tax rate for the rest of the year?", "Chris Kreidler", "Obviously, a normalized rate for Sysco is probably 38%, 39%. What\u2019s going on with the tax rate is primarily driven by the IRS settlement last year and the COLI, both last year and this year. Those are the two main drivers that\u2019s affecting the tax rate.", "Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities", "But as far as what you\u2019re modeling in internally, is 38% to 39% representative of what we should be assuming as well?", "Chris Kreidler", "Well, that\u2019s a normalized tax rate. I\u2019m not really commenting about what we expect for the year, to be candid. We don\u2019t really know what COLI is going to be for the full year. We start the year off assuming COLI is going to be flat. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t flat in this first quarter. We got a benefit from it. We don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen for the duration of the year. So I would say, yes, we started the year assuming 38% to 39%. We knew that we were going to have a lapping issue in the first quarter because of the things that happened in the first quarter last year.", "Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering since you were kind enough to give us a sense of how much of the gross margin was due to the strategic price investments, maybe you could talk a little bit about how much of the volume, the case volume increase we saw also came from those specific categories? I think you said in your prepared remarks that you did get a good response in sales in those categories.", "Bill DeLaney", "I\u2019ll give it my best shot again here. I think in terms of putting that together, what we did say here is that we are seeing double digit increases in those categories where we effectively roll these initiatives out, and we\u2019re not all the way through doing that. So it doesn\u2019t transcend the entire book of business so to speak for the quarter, but we\u2019re pleased with the sales growth that we are seeing. With that said there\u2019s other categories as well that contributed to the sales growth and some of which were the same ones that had some pretty significant inflationary pressures. So its mix, I guess, so there\u2019s not a direct correlation is the short answer.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And then I have a question about inflation. I know you said that you think that the operators could have done a better job passing it along, but maybe you could talk a little bit about the condition, I mean I am sure they all want to make money, so what the conditions might be that would be making it difficult for them to pass it along and is it fair to call that price competition?", "Bill DeLaney", "Well, what I said, I want to be really clear, because I see a lot of our people listening here too. I said we need to do better going forward. We are fine with the quarter, as I said it was acceptable. These are very interesting times in addition to being exciting times. So we got a situation out here where a year ago we had about 3.5 points of deflation, cases were going the wrong way. A year later we\u2019re seeing just the opposite amount of inflation, and we\u2019re encouraged by the case growth.", "If you look at it from our customer standpoint, if you go back three years we\u2019ve been through an environment of two years of pretty significant inflation, a third year deflation, and now we\u2019re into our fourth year here where inflation is picking up in these certain categories. So I\u2019m not saying that we should have done better, I\u2019m really just saying we need to do better going forward and our folks to understand that.", "In terms of how you manage that, essentially you manage it territory by territory, account by account, and you look at each situation and you\u2019re always getting an eye at the operating company level, you\u2019re always trying to strike the right balance between opportunities for growth and opportunities to more effectively, more productively service these accounts with the reality that our customers are running a business as well and we need to be sensitive to what their higher cost items are and what their key concerns are. That\u2019s why we have 8,000 commission sales people out there, that\u2019s why we have Presidents in all these operating companies as to make those decisions on an account by account basis, and overall from an enterprise standpoint we try to give them good guidance and feedback.", "And then on the contract side of the business, the inflation as we\u2019ve talked before impacts a little different, most of the categories are contractually linked to some type of pricing mechanism, and there typically is up to a 30-day time lag from the time the products comes in to when the prices roll. So it depends on whether its street business or contract business.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And then I just have a final question, you were talking about that SYGMA business growing faster, and I just think you generally have opportunities on the contracted side. I was wondering whether the business transformation process is part of what needs to be accomplished for you to go after the contracted business more aggressively, and make sure that that brings at least a comparable financial benefit to the company because it\u2019s obviously lower gross margin business.", "Bill DeLaney", "Well, I think the business transformation initiative is going to help us on both sides. It will definitely help us on the street side in terms of I think our sales people having better tools to work with, as well as our customers, and over time allowing our customers to participate I think more actively in what level of service the wanted, what types of price points, the whole channel opportunity there.", "On the contract side, we are starting to see this already, but to your point, I think we\u2019ll see it more as we have better data and more integrated systems. Our big opportunity on the contract side is to create a more consistent face to the customer of all Sysco\u2019s capabilities. So when you hear us speak about more effectively integrating our capabilities we\u2019re talking about both on the merchandising and the sales side as well as across all of our different businesses, SYGMA, FreshPoint, Meat Company, Guest Supply, all those types of things. So I think the biggest opportunity on the contract side is just from an enterprise standpoint being able to go after this business more cohesively and that\u2019s what we are looking forward to there.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Great, thank you very much.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning. On the business transformation process, when do you think we start to see some of the cost savings falling out of that because it seems like there\u2019s probably some duplicative efforts there at the operating company level versus the parent?", "Chris Kreidler", "As we talked about we finished the design of the business transformation process. We are going through testing, the fourth round of testing of that\u2019s begin, and we\u2019ll start to roll out sometime in the early part of next calendar year. We won\u2019t actually start to see reductions in costs until we get further into the rollout process. That\u2019s the schedule of numbers that we put up back in December at the Investor Day meeting, which we\u2019ll update for you this December at the same time.", "So while we\u2019ve outlined all the costs and the way we\u2019ve been doing that is incremental net of benefits. You really don\u2019t start seeing significant benefits until fiscal 2013, and in that year our current estimates again will be updated in December, but what we showed you last December was the benefits would offset the costs in 2013. So, it\u2019d be about break even in that year, and then thereafter of course we\u2019d see more benefits than costs.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "So we\u2019ll watch for that update on the schedule. And then on the inflation, what do think is a comfortable level of inflation to pass through, where you can get it through and it doesn\u2019t kind of shocks the system and you don\u2019t have problems passing through margin there?", "Bill DeLaney", "I\u2019ll let Chris start with that one, Mark, and\u2026", "Chris Kreidler", "What we\u2019ve always talked about is small amounts in inflation are great for us, one to maybe even three points of inflation. We can handle that and our customers can handle that. When you start spiking above that it causes some problems. We typically believe we can always manage those increases effectively, but maybe they may take more time to pass through the system.", "What we\u2019re commenting about this quarter is three categories. Whereas Bill said, we saw inflation combined in those three categories of close to 10%, and that\u2019s more than we can pass through in any timely manner. So one, two, three we can handle that, our customers handle that. When you start spiking across the board or in certain categories it gets more difficult, and these particular categories are meaningful (inaudible) especially are fairly high margin categories.", "Bill DeLaney", "The other point I think which I am sure most of you on this call understand is this challenge is not unique to our industry, and certainly not to us, there\u2019s a lot of companies that are dealing with this growing inflation issue and the product mix right now. So we need to stay close to our customers and for that matter our suppliers and make good decisions and I believe you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ll do that.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thank you.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thanks Mark.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.", "Jeff Hans - Citigroup", "Hi, guys, this is Jeff Hans actually on behalf of Greg. Following up on the strategic pricing initiatives that you guys have rolled out and as it relates to the overall environment, what are you seeing from your competitors, I guess kind of following those initiatives in those specific markets and I guess just overall, I mean is the environment still pretty competitive versus where it\u2019s been the last few quarters?", "Bill DeLaney", "I\u2019d say the competitive environment is just I think it\u2019s comparable to where it\u2019s been, people are very still very acutely sensitized to case growth and volume growth and getting people into restaurants and their operations that type of things. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a lot of change there. It will be hard for us to gauge any competitive reaction to this. What I would just say again is that we\u2019re seeing some good results on our end. So that\u2019s coming from some place and we are just pleased with what we are seeing and the only point we are trying to make today is it did impact our margin and probably will here for a couple more quarters anyway, but we think it\u2019s an appropriate opportunity for us to take advantage of.", "Jeff Hans - Citigroup", "Just one last one I guess in terms of the trend in case volume growth into October and maybe early November, did that kind of continue at the rate you saw in your fiscal 1Q and also kind of the rate of inflation I guess in October-November as well that accelerated or just stayed constant?", "Bill DeLaney", "We don\u2019t typically a lot of guidance or updates in terms of the quarter, but I think I would say this to you; there has been I think favorable stand in the marketplace we tried to signal that in our comments earlier this morning. We\u2019re encouraged with the volume growth that we\u2019re seeing right now and at the same time, what we\u2019re reading what we feel on our side of the business I don\u2019t think the inflation is going to abate any time soon.", "Jeff Hans - Citigroup", "Thanks so much.", "Bill DeLaney", "Yes.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Good morning.", "Bill DeLaney", "Hi, Andy.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "I guess just a question popped in my head as you answered last question. What is prompting price competition in an improving environment, it seems counter intuitive in most industries and certainly how food service distribution as I know that has historically structured the industries as a lot, they got better, price competition eased seems counterintuitive?", "Bill DeLaney", "While I\u2019ll take a shot at this, if I don\u2019t get it Andy, come back to me. We need to put this in some type of context, this industry has always been highly competitive, there is a lot of competitors out there, there is lot of different people with different business models and different agenda, there is always competition.", "I think maybe to your point we\u2019re in a inflection point now and the cycle I was trying to describe earlier is, if you look at it over three year period I am no food services story, but I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve ever had a three year period like this, where we had two years of lot of inflation and put lot of pressure on our customers, then you have a year of deflation. Now we\u2019re finally starting to see some case growth and we think the industry has shown a little good signs of recovery, but there\u2019s still a lot of sensitivity out there at the operator side and the distributor side in terms of growth and how we continue to based upon our respective businesses.", "So this favorable turn reminds us, let\u2019s be clear we\u2019re talking about may be 2% or 3% growth in our line of business. We\u2019re not talking 7% or 8% real growth. So I think it\u2019s still very, very competitive out there and I think people\u2019s memories are a long right now and everyone is doing everything that he can to not just improve their business but to be prepared for any surprises that come down right here over the next six months to 12 months. So I think it\u2019s more just a weighted impact of what we\u2019ve been through the last two, three years.", "Chris Kreidler", "I am going to jump in and just have one thing. I think we\u2019ve mentioned it, but there it\u2019s mentioning it again. Last year at this time we were reporting deflation of I think 3.4% in our number. We went from a negative 3.4% to positive 3.3% in fairly short year of time and that we\u2019d saw that volatility causes a lot of uncomfortable out there in the market. So we\u2019re going that it\u2019s.", "Bill DeLaney", "A few point, we have an opportunity managers better as I said and we\u2019re committed to doing that.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Let me ask you specifically on this DMA, this consortium of regional. If they just want to I think the McCormick & Schmick contract from you guys was that un-priced and if so what I am trying to figure out is how deep is this price competition and is that what you would consider just kind of normal give and take and there is plenty of stuff you want or is the capacity utilization that some of the distributor might be at, it\u2019s own inflection point where the marginal cost are de minimis as well be it kind of low end contracts, I\u2019m just trying to understand a little more whether market dynamics are the way they are?", "Bill DeLaney", "Yes. I think the only thing I\u2019m going to comment on specifically as it relates to McCormick & Schmick we\u2019re disappointed we lost the business, it was good business for us. In terms of what triggered that decision, I\u2019m not exactly sure of probably all the above. With that said, we\u2019re encouraged with what we\u2019re doing right now in the contract side both in SYGMA and on the multi unit sales portion of our Broadline business here Larry Pulliam, and Kent Humphries and their team.", "We\u2019ve got a lot of momentum there, we\u2019ve made some organization moves and we\u2019re much more focused on segments and that type of thing. We\u2019ll talk more about it in December. We never wanted this business that\u2019s something we\u2019re working very hard on throughout our company to minimize those situations. But I can tell you we\u2019re bringing on business as well and we feel very good about the direction in that area.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "And the last thing, we aren\u2019t using pricing to win business and share, is it more getting actually new customers or is it more expanding into new lines with existing customers and kind of getting to sometimes in this industry, if you win customers and then margins kind of normalize?", "Bill DeLaney", "It\u2019s a little bit of both. I don\u2019t know that I can break that down for you. Certainly the most profitable sale we can make is in incremental sale with an existing customer. So I think there is plenty of opportunity there, it\u2019s also an opportunity to put our best foot forward with prospects. I think it\u2019s both.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "The last thing, as I must missed this on the SAP; could you give us the impact, the earnings impact?", "Bill DeLaney", "We didn\u2019t comment about it because it was not a material change quarter-over-quarter and our guidance has not changed from the 10-K.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you, Andrew.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Great, thank you. Actually it\u2019s just a follow-up on my previous question. Over the last couple of years, your case volume has significantly exceeded that of restaurant traffic as I understand it is reported by the chains, and so the question is, where has your sales growth come from, has it come from sales to existing accounts or as you just mentioned lower margin sales to new accounts, what do you anticipate that mix in general going forward and do you have a good sense for your existing accounts, how your share has changed over the past couple of years, and is there like a medium term target we could possible think about?", "Bill DeLaney", "Is that it?", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Yes, it\u2019s really one question.", "Bill DeLaney", "John, it\u2019s similar to Andy\u2019s, I mean, I think it\u2019s I\u2019m going to need you come back I think but essentially it\u2019s coming from both. I mean, we certainly want to participate in the growth of our existing customers, we are everyday out there trying to improve our share of wallet with those folks, and we do believe we\u2019ve been able to do that. Now that\u2019s hard to quantify, and hard to sometime say with a straight face when the industry has been in decline for a year to two years. But we certainly think that we\u2019ve taken, improved our share of wallet, and taken share for that matter in all segments. So I think what\u2019s helped us a little bit in the overall numbers relative to the restaurant numbers is about 30% of our business or a little bit more than that, 35% I guess, is non-restaurant business.", "So we continue to do well in the institutional side of things and that\u2019s certainly been a buffer for us through these difficult times. But our approach and our model hasn\u2019t changed. We want to grow with our current customers. We want to help them grow, but as we\u2019ve talked before, and we\u2019ll talk in more in December, there is plenty of opportunity for us both on the street side as well as the contract side of this business to bring on new business. The last piece of this and the part that we continue to focus on even more is to protect the business that we have and ensure those customers have been very well to us over the years.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Okay, understood, thanks for the color.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bob Summers with Susquehanna.", "Bob Summers - Susquehanna", "Hey, good morning. I\u2019m just trying to get my arms around the variable labor component of the model a little bit and understand, and I appreciate this is a big picture look, but why an $84 million increase in gross profit dollars drives about a $40 million increase in salaries and related items, so I guess on the surface that seems a rather aggressive path?", "Bill DeLaney", "Well, I\u2019ll start, but I think Chris got some more specifics on this still, but essentially what we try to explain is, just in general you\u2019ve got some incentive increases there at the management side. Bob, we here just talked about productivity improvements, we\u2019re pleased, and we continue to be pleased with what we\u2019re seeing on the operational side of the business as well as on the admin side now.", "But one thing we have done and we talked about this, and we\u2019ll continue to do is we have more aggressively invested in our sales force here over the last six months or so and those numbers are beginning to populate themselves both in terms of the numbers of MAs on the street as well as trainee. So that does translate into higher commissions with the sales growth and into higher fixed investment on the selling payroll side as we try to get back on track in terms of our headcount in sales.", "Without being real specific here, I am just trying to bifurcate that for you in terms of we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing operationally on the admin side in terms of productivity, but we are investing in sales folks, and have been over the three to six months. Chris, do you wanted to?", "Chris Kreidler", "I think you actually have the numbers, I mean, obviously, we started with a gross margin number that was lower than we would have liked, and then the payout came out of that lower number. It comes back to leverage and you\u2019re specifically focusing on the labor side of the equation, I think that\u2019s the answer.", "Bob Summers - Susquehanna", "And then second, can you just talk a little bit about Sysco brand sales? If I am looking at this table that you have in the back properly, did the penetration rate go down?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yes, that\u2019s a trend that we\u2019ve seen now for the better part of two years. So our brand sales are off, and as we\u2019ve been talking we\u2019re concerned about that to a point. Obviously you need to sell customers what it is that they need and they want, but we do have some opportunities there and internally we are doing a lot of work in that area, and I think you\u2019ll see some progress there, but it takes a while to move the needle on that, but we are very focused on that. But again we need to approach that in a way that works for the customer base and that\u2019s the balancing act that we\u2019re dealing with at this point.", "Bob Summers - Susquehanna", "Right. Agreed, but if I were to think of is there intending gross margin drag associated with that change, I\u2019m just trying to think through another component of the gross margin?", "Bill DeLaney", "There can be, but it tends to get woven into the other factors, the other two factors I was talking about. So I can\u2019t tell you that I can call it out specifically, but certainly over time I think it\u2019s clear that when we are able to sell Sysco branded items that that does translate to more leverage on the earnings line.", "Bob Summers - Susquehanna", "Okay, great, thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim", "Bill, so couple of things. If you think about managing the inflation part better, is that just kind of a willingness to pass through more and more quickly or is it something different in terms of how you buy source, get product into the warehouse, which are the two, or is it all of those.", "Chris Kreidler", "Look, I know some little bit like a buffer, it\u2019s a little at the latter and a lot of the former I think so. There is always opportunities as we work with our suppliers to make sure that we\u2019re controlling our cost and we do a good job with that, and we certainly worked very hard on that. The flip side of this is I think we are signaling to you in terms of where we\u2019re at and what we need to do is really more about focus I think. We\u2019ve got the best people in the industry out there, we\u2019ve got great presence, we\u2019ve got 8,000 sales people, they\u2019ve great GSMs working with them.", "So, it\u2019s essentially what I was talking about earlier, which is looking at each customer, each territory, each operating company and just making good decisions and striking the right balance for, in terms of what the customers keeping new jar and what we need and how that translates into moving boxes versus price versus cost efficiency. So I\u2019m going to just leave that focus internally, where we think we can do better than what we have and expect that we will over time.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim", "Have you seen, as the inflation dampened yet particularly where we\u2019ve had the 10% inflation or you haven\u2019t seen that yet?", "Bill DeLaney", "No, I can\u2019t say that we have seen that, we\u2019re seeing pretty good growth in some of those categories.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim", "On the selective price investments, so you\u2019ve got double digit case volume improvement. Does that exceed the amount of price reduction or similar to it or how does that compare?", "Bill DeLaney", "You need more than just double digit to make that working in the short-term. So what you heard me say John was that I think there is opportunities out there for us, but it may take more than a year to get the full payback on that type of initiative.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim", "So it sounds like the investment is in excess of the double digit case volume and you\u2019re hoping to mature into whatever the price investment was?", "Bill DeLaney", "Let me try to be clear here. What I\u2019m saying is, we see opportunities in these particular categories, we\u2019re making some investment in it. We\u2019re rolling it out in different parts of the country at different time. There is somewhat of a cascading effect here and it\u2019s not a six month payback, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim", "Do you expect to get a lift where you\u2019re making those price reductions get a lift not just in those categories, but strategically important in terms of lifting the customers total purchases with you or you haven\u2019t really built that into\u2026", "Bill DeLaney", "Excellent point and that\u2019s all part of it. That\u2019s why we used the word strategic here which is some of that opportunity is to solidify relationships with customers and grow not just on those items but within that category and ideally cost categories. So that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do here.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim", "Final question. The three cycles you\u2019ve done on the rolling out the enterprise and package, what have you learnt, is there anything that jumps out negatively or positively that might have been different than you thought?", "Bill DeLaney", "We\u2019ve learnt; its lot of hard work. We got people working lot of hours down here and there is lot of complexity a lot of detail to it, and we are staying the course, we\u2019re doing everything we can to minimize the surprises once we go to the first part out here.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim", "All right, thanks.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bob Cummins with Wellington Shields.", "Bob Cummins - Wellington Shields", "Thank you and good morning, everybody. I wonder if you could give us a broad overview on the state of the restaurant industry in general now, are we in an early stage of recovery, are the operator still complaining, is the business still down. Where are we going, are we in up trended as yet?", "Bill DeLaney", "There is a part of me that wants to say yes. Certainly the signs we\u2019ve seen since late summer Bob are encouraging. Some reports are coming out and data, both in terms of what the restaurants are seeing in terms of their volume and getting folks into their businesses as well as the sentiment, we\u2019re seeing the psychology pick up a little bit and the optimism pick up ever so slightly, but everything helps here. I think we are beginning to see some things that we\u2019ll hopefully lead to more positive growth for the industry.", "With that said, I think what we\u2019re also continuing to see is the strongest operators are doing the best, as it is in our situation and the distribution side. It\u2019s definitely better than it was a year ago and we believe it\u2019s certainly better than it was maybe six months ago. It\u2019s still somewhat tenuous, but if you are good operator out there today I think overall you\u2019re starting to see some good signs.", "Bob Cummins - Wellington Shields", "Great, that\u2019s very helpful.", "Operator", "With that being our last question that concludes today\u2019s conference.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Neil Russell", "Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Conference Call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

As a result, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 included 13 weeks of operations compared to the fourth quarter last year, which included 14 weeks, and fiscal year 2011 included 52 weeks of operations compared to the prior year, which included 53 weeks.", "On the call today, we will discuss year-over-year comparisons that include the impact of the extra week of operations. However, to provide financial results that are more comparable on a year-over-year basis, certain metrics will be provided which remove the estimated impact of the extra week.

Additional information will be provided in the next couple of weeks. With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported record sales for both our fourth quarter and fiscal year of $10.4 billion and $39.3 billion, respectively. EPS for the quarter was $0.57, which was flat on a GAAP basis compared to the prior year. However, excluding the impact of the prior year's extra week of operations, adjusted EPS grew by 7.5% for the quarter. ", "For the year, EPS was $1.96 compared to $1.99 last year. Similar to the quarter, adjusted EPS grew by 4.2% for the year after excluding the impact of the prior year extra week, the current year's $36 million multiemployer pension plan charge and the year-over-year effect of certain net tax benefits. ", "Focusing on the fourth quarter for a moment, volume growth was positive but remains at modest levels. At the same time, food cost inflation in our product mix remained high and, in fact, was higher than each of the previous 3 quarters this year and the prior year. Thus, due in large parts to these 2 factors, we grew our gross profit dollars but once again experienced a decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales. ", "Turning to the fiscal year, we grew our case volume and generated nearly $40 billion of sales in a market that most industry observers believe is currently flat, resulting in about half a point of share gain. We generated $1.9 billion of operating income, produced cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion and distributed nearly $600 million in dividends to our shareholders. ", "In addition, we invested significant capital in our ongoing business, improved our customer retention performance and improved productivity in our operations. We're also pleased with our progress to date in better integrating our specialty Meat and Broadline operations in a manner that more cohesively addresses our customers' needs. ", "Turning to our multiyear business transformation initiative for a moment. On our last call, we had just recently gone live at our pilot facility in Arkansas. We were pleased with the initial results of the go-live, but as we've moved into a more of a steady-state mode, we have identified some performance issues. We plan to take additional time to further assess the new system's performance and make sure it meets our expectations before the initial wave of operating companies go live. We are evaluating the financial impacts of the delay but expect the result will be extended time and costs to complete the project. We remain firmly committed to a successful business transformation implementation, but as we've said all along, we won't roll this out until we are confident the system will perform as intended. In just a moment, Chris will provide an update on the project's impact on fiscal 2011 and our expectations for fiscal 2012. ", "Taking a step back and looking at the overall business landscape, for sometime now, we have characterized the current economic recovery as slow, choppy, uneven and even fragile. Our fourth quarter results and the events that played out in Washington and in the financial markets over the past 2 weeks certainly support that outlook. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that our industry will experience modest real growth over the long term and that Sysco is particularly well positioned to build upon its industry leadership position over time. ", "Specifically, our commitment to enhancing our service to customers, improving productivity in all parts of our business and broadening our foundation for future growth are key to Sysco's ongoing success. ", "In closing, I would like to thank our entire leadership team and all of our associates for their efforts and engagement over the past year. Their commitment to the success of Sysco's customers is unsurpassed in our industry. ", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.", "Robert Kreidler", "Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. What I'd like to do first this morning is provide a brief summary of the formal GAAP results. As Neil just mentioned, fiscal 2010 was a 53-week year compared to our typical 52-week year. GAAP results include the impact of that extra week of operations last year, which means the results that I will discuss compare 13 weeks of operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 14 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2010 and similarly, 52 weeks of operations in fiscal 2011 to 53 weeks in fiscal 2010. ", "On a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter, sales were $10.4 billion, an increase of 0.7% compared to the prior year. Gross profit declined 2.3% to $1.9 billion, and operating expenses declined 1.5% to $1.4 billion. As a result, operating income was $561 million, a decrease of 4% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $336 million, a decrease of 0.4%, and earnings per share were $0.57, which were flat compared to the prior year. ", "For the full year, on a GAAP basis, sales were $39.3 billion, an increase of 5.6% compared to the prior year. Gross profit increased 3% to $7.3 billion, and operating expenses increased 5% to $5.4 billion. As a result, operating income was $1.9 billion, a decrease of 2.2% compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 2.4%, and earnings per share were $1.96 compared to $1.99 in the prior year or a decrease of 1.5%. ", "As I mentioned, these year-over-year comparisons on a GAAP basis are not comparable because that extra week of operation in last year's fourth quarter impacts all the year-over-year comparisons, so what I'd like to do next is discuss our results for the quarter and the year excluding the impact of last year's extra week. That means these adjusted numbers compare 13 weeks of operations in both quarters and 52 weeks of operations in both years. This should give you a better sense for what's going on in our business and, at the same way the management team tracks and analyzes our financial results. These numbers are detailed in 2 tables we included in the earnings release that I think you will find helpful. ", "On an adjusted basis, for the quarter, sales increased 8.5% compared to the prior year due primarily to the impact of food cost inflation, which we estimated at 5.9% for the period. In addition, compared to adjusted sales in the prior year, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.9%, and changes in foreign exchange rate increased sales by 0.7%. This equates to real sales growth of 1%. ", "Adjusted gross profit increased 5.3% during the quarter. However, gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 57 basis points year-over-year to 18.6% due in large part to high inflation rates and fairly stagnant industry growth during the period. In addition, while strategic pricing initiatives were also a factor, they were largely offset by the fuel surcharge benefit. ", "As Bill mentioned, the 5.9% inflation rate was higher than any of the 3 previous quarters this year and significantly higher than the 1.5% deflation experienced in fiscal year 2010. ", "Adjusted operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter by $78 million or 6%. The increase was driven by several factors. First, salaries and related expense increased $24 million. The increase was due to higher delivery payroll costs, payroll from newly acquired companies, foreign exchange translations and sales compensation. These additional expenses were partially offset by a decline in annual incentive compensation. ", "Second, fuel cost increased $17 million. However, the fuel surcharge we implemented late in the third quarter was designed to mitigate this increase and did so. As a reminder, fuel surcharges are reflected in gross profit. ", "Third, as we've seen all year, expenses related to the company's corporate-sponsored pension plan increased $15 million. Fourth, expenses related to the company's Business Transformation Project were $12 million higher. This number represents the increase in gross project expenses, which is all project expenses, including all employees and consultants working on the project, severance costs and depreciation, without any offset or credit for any benefits from the project. ", "Adjusted operating income increased 3.4% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were $23 million compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share increased 7.5%. ", "Turning to the year-over-year comparison. Sales increased 7.7% or $2.8 billion for the year on an adjusted basis. Food cost inflation was estimated at 4.6% for the year. In addition, compared to adjusted sales in the prior year, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.7%, and changes in foreign exchange rate increased sales by 0.5%. This equates to real sales growth of 1.9%. ", "Adjusted gross profit increased 5.1% during the year, while gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 46 basis points year-over-year to 18.6%. The decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales was due to high inflation rate, strategic pricing initiatives and fairly stagnant industry growth for the period. ", "Adjusted operating expenses increased $358 million or 7.1% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of: one, a $129 million increase in sales and related costs due to increases in delivery and sales compensation, foreign exchange and acquisitions; two, a $60 million increase in costs related to the company's corporate-sponsored pension plan; three, a $36 million charge related to the withdrawal of an operating company from an MEPP; four, a $37 million increase in fuel expense; and five, $25 million in higher gross project expenses related to the company's Business Transformation Project. As a result, adjusted operating income was essentially flat for the fiscal year. If the MEPP charge had been excluded, operating income increased 1.7%. ", "Adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2011 decreased $4 million or 0.3% compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2011 EPS was $1.96, which included a $0.04 negative impact from the MEPP charge and a $0.02 tax benefit. Adjusted EPS from the prior year period was $1.95, which included a $0.05 benefit from the company's IRS settlement. Excluding the MEPP charge and tax benefit in the current year and the IRS settlement gain in the prior year, adjusted EPS increased 4.2% year-over-year. ", "Turning to a brief update on our business transformation initiative. We have previously estimated that the incremental EPS impact from the project, which is the incremental cost of the project net of estimated benefits, for fiscal 2011 would be from $0.02 to $0.04. The actual impact for the year came in at the low end of the range at $0.02. ", "For the past couple of years, we've provided the estimated impact from the Business Transformation Project to our EPS using this incremental net of benefit concept. Going forward, we're going to use a different basis of presentation to give you more visibility into both the total project expenses and the underlying business performance. We will provide expenses and capitalized costs as we typically have. However, instead of providing the EPS impact of incremental expenses net of benefits as we've done in the past, we will provide gross project expenses. Now gross project expenses include all expenses related to the project, including all the employees and consultants working on the project, severance costs and depreciation without any offset or credit for any benefits from the project. They also include additional costs, such as those for our shared business services. ", "We're sharing the numbers this late because we want you to be able to see and track the total cost of the project, which will decline over time, as well as how the underlying business is performing. So using our new dimension for fiscal 2011 results, gross expenses related to our Business Transformation Project totaled $102 million. In addition, we capitalized $196 million related to the project. The total cash outlay during the year, which, of course, is different than expense, was $279 million, roughly in line with the guidance we've previously provided. However, as we discussed throughout this year, the nature of the work actually performed allowed us to capitalize more than we had originally anticipated. ", "As Bill mentioned earlier, we have experienced some delays on our rollout schedule for the project. As we discussed in the third quarter, we extended our testing phase by about 3 months to ensure a successful go-live in Arkansas, which we achieved. Now that we are close to a steady-state environment in Arkansas, we have identified some performance issues. We plan to take some additional time, probably as much as 3 months, to assess and enhance the system's performance. ", "Looking forward, we now believe it's more prudent to roll out only one of the wave 1 companies initially, to ensure we can operate successfully in multiple locations, and then we'll roll out through the rest of wave 1. That will probably extend the timeline another 3 months or so. As a result, we are probably 6 to 12 months behind. These delays will increase the total cost of the project. We're in the process of reevaluating the long-term costs, benefits and timing of the project and expect to provide updated guidance at our Investor Day in December. For fiscal 2012, we expect gross project expenses to total approximately $280 million to $300 million. In addition, we expect to capitalize approximately $100 million to $120 million related to our Business Transformation Project. ", "So if you look back at 2009, we reported EPS of $1.77. Our gross business transformation expenses in that year were $0.04 per share, so adjusted EPS without these gross project expenses would have been $1.81. In fiscal 2010, we reported adjusted EPS of $1.90, excluding the extra week of operations and the IRS gain. Our gross business transformation expenses that year were $0.09 per share, so adjusted EPS without these expenses would have been $1.99. ", "In fiscal year 2011, we've just reported adjusted EPS of $1.98, excluding the MEPP and tax benefit. Gross business transformation expenses were $0.11 per share, so adjusted EPS without these expenses would have been $2.09. So the way we look at the underlying business performance over the last 3 fiscal years, EPS on an adjusted basis excluding the costs related to our Business Transformation Project has grown from $1.81 to $1.99 to $2.09. This is during one of the worst business climates any of us have ever experienced. ", "While we've indicated our business transformation expense will be higher in fiscal 2012 by between $0.18 and $0.20 per share, we believe we will continue to grow our underlying earnings excluding these gross project costs. Going forward, we'll continue to provide our results with and without gross project expenses so that you will be able to see that progress. We remain firmly committed to a successful business transformation implementation, and we continue to believe that it will provide significant benefits to our customers and our business. ", "Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $1.1 billion, reflecting IRS settlement payments totaling $212 million. In fiscal 2010, cash flow from operations was $885 million and was net of IRS payments totaling $528 million and an extra pension contribution payment of $140 million. We have now paid the majority of the total IRS settlement amount, and we'll pay the final $212 million in this fiscal year 2012. ", "Capital expenditures totaled $182 million for the fourth quarter and $636 million for the year. Spending for the year included investments in technology, including our business transformation initiative, fleet replacement, the renovation of our shared services facility and replacement or expansion of facilities in Pennsylvania, California and Central Texas. ", "Looking ahead into next year, there are several important items that we want you to keep in mind as you think about fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2011, we recorded $28 million in COLI [Corporate Owned Life Insurance] gains. We haven't talked about COLI much this year because the year-over-year variances have been immaterial. Going forward, we do not expect to record any substantial gains or losses related to COLI as a result of changes we made during the fourth quarter and the underlying investments. While there will be a notable year-over-year COLI variance in fiscal 2012 of $28 million, we're pleased to be able to remove this volatility from our financial results going forward. ", "In addition, we are also providing a few guidance metrics for the year ahead. First, we expect capital spending for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million as we continue to invest in our business. This projection includes $100 million to $120 million related to business transformation capital spending, as well as capital related to a number of facility expansions and new facilities in Southern California, Boston, Long Island and our third RDC. ", "We expect pension expense for the year, as measured on June 30, to be approximately $25 million lower than fiscal 2011. This decrease is primarily due to improved performance of our planned assets during the year. ", "Third, we expect fuel expense, which impacts operating expense, to be approximately $35 million to $45 million higher year-over-year, but we expect that increase to be substantially mitigated by fuel surcharges. ", "And finally, we expect share buybacks to increase next year to offset dilution from option exercises but expect the diluted shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 to be similar to diluted shares in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. ", "In closing, while the business environment in fiscal 2011 was challenging, our operating companies did a great job of managing through those challenges with a strong focus on serving our customers, growing cases, managing costs and improving productivity. And although the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain, we are confident that our strong balance sheet, industry leadership position and solid strategy for the future provide us the resources and capabilities to drive continued success. With that, operator, we will now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "I'd like to just ask a couple of -- maybe these are sort of housekeeping questions. Sales got a benefit from fuel surcharges. How much of a benefit was that?", "William DeLaney", "Meredith, for whatever reason, you were breaking up. This is Bill. Could you just repeat that?", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Sure. I'm just wondering how much benefit to sales came from the fuel surcharges as a percentage of growth?", "William DeLaney", "I wouldn't say it was overly significant to the sales line. I think as Chris pointed out, it helped to defray our fuel expense in terms of the delta there, but I wouldn't say it was a big part of the sales percentage.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And can you talk a little bit more about the performance issues you're seeing at the Business Transformation Process?", "William DeLaney", "Sure. Essentially, I would say to you that we, like I said in my prepared comments, we got into the pilot site in Arkansas in April. As Chris pointed out, we did do some additional testing, so we're probably 3 months delayed getting into that. And as we got into the conversion weekend, as you can appreciate, there's always a lot of things that go on in those weekends, but we got through it. We delivered groceries. We've ordered product, and we're taking care of our customers. As time went on, it became clear that we were still having issues with the ease of taking orders, the ease of processing orders, both on the buy and the sell side. We have some speed issues from a performance standpoint in terms of how long it takes for the customer or for the salesperson to put an order in. We've also had some issues with reports, that type of thing. So obviously, as we went into this initiative, Meredith, we've cautioned ourselves and everyone that we talk to to be prepared for the unexpected. And so while we were generally prepared for some challenges, these were things that we couldn't really anticipate until we got into the pilot. So those are examples, kind of high-level examples of some things we're running into. And where we are right now is we're very focused on a combination, really, of a couple of things. One is, pardon the expression, we're fixing those things, and so to the extent that they were designed and that they are working close to how they're supposed to work, we're attempting to make them work better and more efficiently for our customers and for our sales people and for all of our associates. To the extent that we've tripped into some design issues or flaws, we're going back, and relooking at that.  And then to the side, there were several, what we call, enhancements or additional features that were never targeted to go into Arkansas being a pilot, and we're also working on those.  And we would hope to have all that worked into the Arkansas company here as we get into November and early December.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "I mean, obviously, you had some issues, and you need to fix them. But would it be fair to say that the environment has turned out to be much more challenging than you thought it would be at this point in time and that it just is prudent to slow down this project because the expenses are very high? I mean, if you kept ahead, the gross margin being this weak, aren't you -- weren't you running the risk of pretty weak earnings overall?", "William DeLaney", "Well, I don't think it's gotten to that point. What I would say to you is basically what I said in my prepared comments, which is we need this system to work better before we roll it out to additional companies.  And that's really what our focus is, which is to get it working as well as it needs to work. That's why you do a pilot, and that's where we're at. I don't think -- what you see Chris trying to do here in his comments is we're going to do as diligent an effort as we can as we go forward to separate for you how the core business is running and then what the project is costing us at any point in time. So clearly, we have to be aware of the project cost and sensitive to that. But at this point, I wouldn't say we're at a point where the expenses of the project are that big of a concern. We just want to roll it out in a way that our operating companies will embrace it and engage appropriately and that it serves our customers the way it's designed to.", "Robert Kreidler", "Meredith, I'll jump in also. I mean, just taking on your question. I mean, it's a classic issue of \"do you slow down a long-term strategic project because the short-term expense implications are too high?\" And clearly, the answer we're going to give you is no. It is a very important strategic project to us. We're tripping over some of the steps that, frankly, we expected would be there eventually. You just don't know where they're going to come from, but you know they're going to come out of the woodwork once you turn the thing on. And we'll work through those, and we'll work through the expense related to any delays. But we're nowhere near a point where we would say, \"we should slow this thing down because it's costing us in the short term in a difficult operating environment\".", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Great. That's a good way of thinking of it in my view. And then just finally, are there any benefits at this point in time to the Business Transformation Process?", "Robert Kreidler", "Yes. Look, the way we measure benefits, which you've got to find some science to measure benefits, and so the team established some science behind it, the way we measure benefits. Yes, there are benefits, what we call the hard dollar benefits.  And to do that, you basically start with a point in time and you measure your headcount in the affected areas, those areas where you're going to be making some fairly dramatic changes, and then you track the headcount reductions over time, and that's how you measure benefits. Well, we have some of those benefits. But the struggle is some of those benefits come from attrition, as well as other means, and you may get some attrition before you're expecting it, and you just choose not to replace those people. So you're getting some of that benefit early. That doesn't necessarily mean it's going to stick because the system is only in Arkansas right now. So anything we have right now is one, small and two, it's going to fluctuate because of the way we're measuring it. The real proof will be, frankly, as we start to roll this thing out and we start to look at the overall expense reduction out in the field and the affected areas, that's where we're going to have the hard dollar benefits as we continue to talk about those. And that's going to be a little while.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And benefits in terms of revenues?", "Robert Kreidler", "Nothing that we could even begin to measure, no.", "William DeLaney", "Again, Meredith, to take you back to the business case, we've been really clear on this. There's a hard dollar business case here that's driven mostly by headcount reduction, I mean, the administrative side of the business and by leveraging our headcount more effectively as we grow the business and sales. So Arkansas is a pilot, and at this point, we have our hands full in Arkansas and in the shared business center essentially getting through this transition. So we're not really -- we never were really looking for significant benefits at this stage of the project in Arkansas. That's why we call it a pilot. The benefits Chris was alluding to are some more structural things that we've done to prepare in terms of overall headcount, management-wise, and organizationally heading into this transition.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Neil Currie with Dahlman Rose.", "Neil Currie", "I just wanted to, first of all, talk about the inflation trend. Obviously, inflation was a little higher than it was in the third quarter, but you have more of a struggle passing it through than you have in the third quarter. So I was wondering what changed so meaningfully to put that much pressure on your gross margin compared to the third quarter, which looked as if it was very much an improving trend?", "William DeLaney", "I'll take a shot at that, Neil. Essentially, you're right. I mean, what we've seen is increasing levels of inflation in our cost of goods as the year's gone along, and it was at least a point higher, I think, in the fourth quarter versus the third. In terms of the reasons for that, a lot of the same categories that have been high all year, the Meat, the Dairy, the Seafood, they've remained high, and some other categories that represent a significant amount of our purchases, Canned & Dry, comes to mind, have also begun to absorb higher increases in our purchasing costs over the last quarter or 2. So that's pretty much been the consistent trend. In terms of why we struggled more in the fourth quarter versus the third, that's a difficult thing to answer in terms of specifics. I would tell you that as inflation goes up, it is harder and harder to pass that along as you can appreciate. And I would also tell you that we see all the data out there that comes with the economy and some of the restaurant surveys and that type of thing, but we felt, we certainly felt, our people felt that after Mother's Day, the business slowed down a little bit, flattened out some in May, maybe picked up in June, hard to tell depending on who you're talking to and what sources you read. But I would say the market environment itself got a little tougher here as the quarter went along.", "Neil Currie", "Okay. And without a crystal ball, it must be hard, but do you have a view on when inflation may peak?", "William DeLaney", "Well, we've got a crystal ball. It actually just doesn't work. And it's hard to tell. What I would tell you is it doesn't appear to be leveling out. As we sit here today, everything you read and feel is that it's probably going to be with us here for the foreseeable future.  We'll have to communicate that with each quarter, that type of thing. But looking out the next couple of quarters, I certainly expect it to stay relatively high.", "Neil Currie", "Okay. And looking at your 2-year real -- your real sales growth trends, it actually looked a pretty good quarter. You saw some continued improvement in the 2-year number. Did you say earlier that through the quarter, that sales moderated and then improved towards the end of the quarter? July was better than June, is that right? Did I hear you say that?", "Robert Kreidler", "No, we actually didn't say that. Yes, I think what you're referring to is the 2-year year-over-year-over-year is actually fairly good on a real basis, and I don't think we actually looked at that number in the last couple of days, but you're probably right. Despite the fact that, as Bill said, the industry is very stagnant right now, the calculations that we've done using external sources says we actually grew our share in here during the course of the year, we grew our share by another half point, which we manage to do consistently. So we continue to find growth, even though the market is not helping us.", "William DeLaney", "Yes, I think -- I went back and looked at some of that as well. If you looked at the 4 quarters for the year, our best quarter for the real growth was the first quarter. I don't know. I think things may have felt a little bit better at that point in time, but there's some math in that number, too. We were comparing off of a very weak time from the year before. So when you look at this thing over the last 4 or 5 quarters, it really is hard to draw a conclusion from one quarter to the next in terms of the divine growth.", "Neil Currie", "But intra-quarter, did you see -- what was the sales trend in the fourth quarter? How did that progress?", "William DeLaney", "It's a tough quarter as you saw in terms of our numbers. All I can tell you is what -- and this is anecdotal. And then what we all read is that we felt like we started to flatten out a little bit here in May compared to April. And others are saying, there's some surveys out there that talk about the restaurant business numbers improving somewhat in June. I don't know that we experienced that in June. So I would say it's soft in beginning of May and stayed that way, at least from our perspective, through the end of the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "I wanted to circle back and kind of follow up on Meredith's question on the business transformation costs. I just want to make sure I understand, number one, if the gross cost was $0.11 and the net was $0.02, that's a $0.09 per share differential. But I'm pretty sure it wasn't what you guys would call benefits from the project, so could you kind of just tell us what is in most of that $0.09? Is it really the kind of the accounting that's been -- you talked about in the Q that is allowing you to capitalize more of the costs and things like that?", "Robert Kreidler", "No. And actually, I'm glad you asked the question because you're tripping over, frankly, the reason we're changing the method in which we report this. I got to take you back in history. We reported this from the beginning as incremental cost to the company net-of-benefits. So let me take first the incremental. That meant only the additional costs to the company, so all these people internally, and we have a large number of people that are dedicated to this project that were Sysco employees that we transferred into the project, we did not count as an additional expense. So when we added up the expenses, it wasn't $100 million in that particular way of accounting for it, and then we've netted benefits against that, and you're right, the benefits were not $0.09 a share. So that's where we got to our estimate, most recent estimate of $0.02 to $0.04 on an incremental-net-of-benefits basis. The problem with that is it doesn't give you full visibility to the actual cost of the project. So we just pushed that away. We said, \"Look, we're just going to disclose everything\". So it\u2019s all categories, all functions that are directly related to our Business Transformation Project, that's the $102 million that you're seeing today. I'm not netting the benefit to get that. As I said to Meredith earlier, they're not very large at this point in time.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, all right. So I need to look -- what was the fiscal '10 gross spend, so we can look at the net number there?", "Robert Kreidler", "Fiscal '10 gross spend on a per share basis...", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Well, that's the $0.09?", "Robert Kreidler", "Yes, that's the $0.09. You got to go back to $0.09. Yes, $0.09. And again, Andy, what we're trying to do in that is take you backwards so that you got the same basis that we're reporting now. You've got it for 2009. You got it for 2010.", "William DeLaney", "That's the gross expense, not the gross spend per se.", "Robert Kreidler", "That's right. That's the gross expense. It doesn't really apply to cash.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Got it, yes. And Bill, as you're talking about slowing things down on functionality, I mean, it's kind of normal for IT to have that. But as you talk about just things like order entry, for example, is it -- the issue is more around the employees needing to get familiar with what they're doing and a new way of doing things and being trained, or is it more kind of substantive that you feel that maybe the pages they're looking at on the computer or whatever actually need to be redesigned? Or are you still -- or is it somewhere in between? I'm trying to figure out if the actual heart of the programming is something that is not performing, or is it more around sort of normal things in IT?", "William DeLaney", "I get it. That's a good question, Andy. So I would say, look, there's always opportunities, I think, to improve how we train and prepare people for these changes and conversions and our change in [indiscernible] process. We felt we did a pretty good job there, and I think if that was the only issue we had, we probably wouldn't be having a delay right now. So there's always issues like that. Some of it's screens. I think to give you an illustration of an example, I guess, of what it would be is we built this thing. And obviously, keep in mind that what we -- the whole mantra for this thing is we're trying to build a platform here that will help us be more productive in the selling exercise and help our customers be more productive as well and have the experience be more positive experience. So as we went down that road and built in some of these enhancements, what's turned out to happen is in certain instances, those have worked or most of them have worked, but there's been residual effects, say, on processing time or on the ability for the MA or the account exec to see the orders as well as they'd like or maybe to modify the order, those types of things. So it's kind of a cause-and-effect thing. We did this to enhance it, but there is a side effect that we could have anticipated, so we got into the pilot, and so we're working through that. But there's enough of that that we need to slow down here and address it.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "That flavor is helpful. And just lastly, as it -- you've been talking previously about acquisition pipeline getting a little better. And does this delay in the ERP and business transformation, would that affect that, or do you think that's something you could kind of carve out and do some acquisitions, either minor or major regardless?", "Robert Kreidler", "No. The way we think about acquisitions, there's the kind of the small step we do every chance we get and that anything going on with our ERP project wouldn't affect that at all. We continue to do those. I think we grew sales last year. The amount of deals we closed last year represented a little over 1% of sales. We're reporting about 0.9% impact in the fourth quarter. So we're going to continue to do those without regard to the timing and sequencing and all that from the business transformation. When you start to talk about larger transactions that would affect our Broadline company, we are cautious about that. We've talked about that before. This is a very important strategic objective for us, this business transformation. We're not going to take risks and screw it up, and so we're being very careful that anything we do would not get in the way of that rollout, and that will continue to be the case as long as necessary.", "William DeLaney", "I think just to amplify that, Andy, we've been real clear on this. We would not take on a major acquisition that we felt going into it would significantly impact our core business in the near term as we're going through this 2012. So I guess to put my color on it, to the extent that we've got a delay here, that will extend that period for a little bit.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Great. I really appreciate the added insight and clarity into the business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "A couple of things. When is the first wave now scheduled that you guys think to be completed with the SAP rollout?", "William DeLaney", "We don't have a point estimate for that, John, at this point. Where we're at right now in order is we're very focused on Arkansas and the shared business center and getting that up to, as I said earlier, to where it's working the way we designed it to work or at least very, very close to how we designed it to work, and secondly, to get our enhancements in as well as the fixes that we've tripped over here going through this pilot. So those are the 2 priorities, getting Arkansas and SBS working and getting the fixes and the enhancements in. We hope to be in a position to have accomplished a good part of that by the end of November, early December.  And then right now, our plan would be to go to one site. You could almost call it a second pilot, John, at some point after the first of the year. And the whole goal of that site would be strictly to see that this system can support multiple, or in this case 2 operating companies. And if all goes well there, then we'll come up with a revised schedule for the remainder of wave 1.", "Robert Kreidler", "And John, just a little more color. To the extent we can when we get together in December, we'll give you additional color. To the extent we have at that point in time, we'll give you everything we know.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Because you do think you will get to a point where all of the kinks are worked out, so you can go fairly quickly at the subsequent waves that there will not have to be learnings, new learnings with each wave, or do you think there will be?", "Robert Kreidler", "Look, it's the good news/bad news of having 85 Broadline operating companies that eventually, we're going convert. While they're all a little bit different, what they do out there is generally the same. And so I'm not going to say that what happens in Arkansas is exactly the same thing is what happens in Dallas is what happens in L.A. But the underlying business processes are generally the same.  And so going to one and working out the majority of the kinks makes it much more probable that number 2 and number 3 will work just fine. The reason that, as Bill said and I've amplified also, that we've decided we're going to one more operating company next is we actually want to nail the fact that we can do this, that it's up and running and works just properly at multiple operating companies. That's why we're going to take that added step in there. We know it's going to cost us a little more time, but that's why we're going to do it. But there's nothing that we've seen that tells us that this thing is not going to work. These are problems. They can be fixed. They all have solutions. It's just a matter of getting the solutions implemented and tested and rolled. And I'm just going to keep coming back to the same statement. We don't want to roll this thing before it's ready because a problem in Arkansas, while it's a real problem for Arkansas, does not disrupt our business. What we can't afford to have is a problem when we've rolled it out before the operating companies, and we're just not going to take that risk.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "As a follow-up to that, if you think about, and maybe it's too early to get your arms around this, but when you think about the ultimate benefit, has that changed at all? And then when you think about -- you guys have sort of laid out how this would roll through the P&L, and there was a point at which, I think it was 2013, but a point at which where the benefits would begin to ramp. Is that all basically in place just later? So I guess 2 related questions. But can you get your arms around that yet, or it's too early?", "Robert Kreidler", "Well, let me tell you what we know. Again, we're trying to be as full disclosure as we can. One, do we still believe in the benefits of the project? Absolutely, we do. Two, is it fair to say that those benefits are probably delayed to the extent that the project is delayed? Yes.  And the third point is do we have a time frame for those yet? And we don't. That was my comment. We're reevaluating based upon everything we're learning in Arkansas. We're reevaluating the long-term costs and the benefits and the timing of that. And again, to the extent we can, we'll give you more insight into that in December.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "But the magnitude of the benefits, whatever you thought would exist in whenever, 2015 or '16, is it too early to tell whether that magnitude has changed?", "Robert Kreidler", "Yes, we don't sit -- as we sit here today, we don't feel there's a significant difference in the magnitude of the benefits. Now the timing of the benefits, of course, will change. But there's nothing that causes us to believe that we can't get the benefits that we set out to achieve.", "William DeLaney", "And John, I would just add to that. When we went into this thing, we were talking about a business case, which I took you through earlier. But we're also talking about a transformational case here, which we've chosen not to quantify because, frankly, it's impossible to quantify because you have to compare it to something that you didn't know what it's going to be. So if anything, look, this is a little frustrating for everybody, but we knew these things are going to happen at some point in the project. But in terms of where we are and in terms of our commitment to it, the only thing I wish, I just wish we had started this a year or 2 earlier because the marketplace we're in today requires us to be much more nimble and requires us to be even more customer-focused and engaged than what we've been historically. And that is the transformational case of this work. So we're very, very committed to it.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "And then one final thing on inflation. How do you get your arms around elasticities and knowing whether taking pricing will -- it would seem to me like you could take more pricing than you have. Is there a way to get more comfortable with that and get a better sense of elasticity on the volume side, so you can take pricing more quickly?", "William DeLaney", "Well, to be honest with you, and I think you know this, John, we don't talk a lot about elasticity. We're sitting on a table and certainly, our opcos don't talk a lot about elasticity. Where we're at today, we're in a market right now that isn't growing. We're taking share, but we've got to make an investment to take share. So I would tell you my view on this thing is that for the foreseeable future, it's about gross profit dollar growth and it's about cost per case.  And if we continue to grow the gross profit dollars, we need to do somewhat better than what we did here this past quarter, then we'll be fine. We've got to manage the cost per case, and it's very difficult right now to determine how much of that gross profit dollar growth is going to come from inflation, come from case growth, come from margin mitigation, whatever you want to call it.  And that's the charge that we put out on our operating company presidents and their management teams and probably their people, their sales managers and their marketing associates, as well as the account execs.  We're all in this together here, and we're just trying to make good decisions on a day-in-and-day-out basis at the customer level to strike the right balance between case growth, pricing and margin. And so again, where I come out of this thing is we're very locked in right now on our gross profit dollar growth and managing our cost per case.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "But you seem as if you don't really want cases to go negative, meaning if you took more -- if you got more price pass-through, say gross was down 15, 20 basis points, but case growth went negative, that would be, in your mind, a worse outcome, even if it had the same gross profit dollar performance, a worst outcome than where we are today. Is that fair?", "William DeLaney", "Well, it's a little bit of a loaded question. I think what I'm saying to you is, first of all, we've been very focused this past year and will continue to be on improving our customer retention performance. It's good. It needs to be great.  And so that ties in your cases, that type of thing. So I would say yes. I mean, look, it's a very competitive world out there today, and we've rolled up our sleeves, and we're grinding out there with everybody else, but not if the cost of doing things that we think are shortsighted or unintelligent. So I wouldn't say -- it just depends on the situation in terms of that trade off. But certainly, long term, our DNA and our whole mode of operating is to grow the business. But we think we're making intelligent decisions out there. It's just from quarter-to-quarter, you are going to see some volatility.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "I wanted to ask a little more about the nature of the inflation. You had hinted like the last quarter that there might be a broadening of inflation into some other areas beyond really the Meat and Dairy and Seafood. Can you talk about that a little bit? And as we are getting into the first and second quarter where you lapped the big gross margin declines last year, is it that you have really already taken those body blows in Meats and now we shouldn't see as big margin declines?", "Robert Kreidler", "On the first part of your question, Mark, we are seeing broader inflation, and by that, I mean across more categories. It's difficult the way we define the impact from inflation. We basically look at which categories saw the most significant increase in terms of our product mix and our basket of goods, and we define those as the high-inflation categories. And when we talked about how much of our gross margin decline is attributable to inflation, we point at those categories, and all the rest kind of balance out, some are up, some are down. This quarter was not the case. We looked at the high-inflation categories, and then you looked at all the rest, and they were still up.  And so we've got inflation across a broader spectrum, not nearly as high as the ones we're calling out but across a broader spectrum. So that's the first answer to your question. Second, looking ahead is very, very difficult for us to do. On the one hand, you'd like to say, \"It's very rare for us to go year-over-year with a decline in gross margins\". At the same time, we're looking at inflation, and as Bill said earlier, \"We don't have -- well, our crystal ball apparently is not working very well\". We can't tell you what's going to happen to the inflation rate. All we know is what we're seeing right now is it's not going back down. And so that's going to play into the next quarter, quarter 1, 2 and 3.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And maybe just talk a little more of what you're seeing anecdotally out there. The Knapp-Track data, I guess, turned negative in late July, and are you getting any feedback from the operators out there, what they're hearing after the stock market correction? Has there been any change in restaurant demand?", "William DeLaney", "Well, it's only been a couple of weeks, and I would say it's probably too early to make that call. Obviously, we're concerned about it, but the other thing I would say is \"I think, to some extent, this market is reacting to things that our customers and the consumer and our people have already experienced over the last year, which is this choppiness of the recovery. And again, I'm not an economist or politician or anything, but I think what you're seeing in the market is just a lot of uncertainty from day to day. There's not going to be any great solutions coming in the short term, and I think the market is kind of focused on that, as well as some things beyond the U.S. So we're concerned about what's going on in the market, but I think we need to take a few weeks and just see how this plays out because I don't know that in terms of the world we work in that all that much has changed.", "Operator", "You have a question from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc", "So I guess over the last 2 weeks or so, it really doesn't sound like it's changed all that too much for you, even with the stock market volatility?", "William DeLaney", "Well, we don't typically comment, Greg, on interim quarter results. I'm trying to paint you a picture here where, so far, I think it's just too early to make that call.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc", "Right, right. Okay, that's helpful.  And just in terms of gross margins sort of the impacts like this quarter, what was the biggest impact? Was it the high-inflation certain categories, certain customer, product mix, changes or just discounting by either you or your competitors? Was there one thing that was the biggest factor?", "William DeLaney", "I think it just goes on. It's more and more difficult to attribute it to any one factor. What we're trying to articulate today is -- Chris talked about the strategic price initiatives. There were still some of that, the fuel surcharge offset, most of that if not all of it. I think my message to you today is it's 2 things. One is the environment where the continuing and now the acceleration of inflation does make it difficult, as well as the market environment, where essentially, you're flat to no-growth type of low growth environment. It just makes it tougher, and everyone is out there competing from our customer to the suppliers to ourselves and our competition. So I think part of it is the environment that is continuing to really not improve a whole lot. It's better than it was 2 years ago, but it's not an easy environment to operate in.  And then second, there's areas where we just need to execute better, and I touched on those earlier. We need to do a little better job growing our gross profit dollars relative to our expectations, and we need to manage our cost per case better. And those are the things we're very focused on here as we start the new year.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "It's Amod Gautam on for John. The past couple of quarters, you guys provided a breakout in terms of the gross margin impact between strategic pricing and commodity inflation. I was wondering if you could do that for the latest quarter?", "Robert Kreidler", "We really didn't break it out for the quarter. And I'll be honest. The reason we didn't is because the inflation broadened so much that the way we were coming up with the numbers, we didn't have as much confidence in. As we've said in the script, inflation was a significant impact of it, and then the strategic pricing initiatives were still there, but they were offset by the fuel surcharge. So that's the best breakdown we can give you. For the year, we're basically -- I think the numbers add up to about 2/3 of it is what we would call kind of inflation and the related issues around that, and about 1/3 of it would've been strategic pricing initiatives for the year, which is, I believe, 46, 47 basis points.", "Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay, that's helpful.  And just in terms of building off of that, I mean, the strategic pricing initiatives, if you could just give some qualitative color about how those have played out relative to what your expectations were when you implemented them? And then second to that is how much longer you expect the pricing initiatives to continue to impact year-on-year margins.", "Robert Kreidler", "Yes, I think we've said in prior quarters we continue to get the benefit that we sought from strategic pricing initiatives, which is we're growing cases in the specific categories that we targeted there. We also acknowledged that if anything, it's going to take longer to get the case growth that we originally had set out to achieve. Whatever estimate we did originally, it's just going to take us longer to get that, so you're going to still see the impact in our numbers. At some point, there will be a lapping effect to that. I'm not going to try to predict that for you here, but it's still in our numbers. There will be a lapping impact that will make it less of an issue, and we certainly aren't sitting here today designing any new strategic pricing initiatives that we put in place quickly. So hopefully, we'll continue to get the benefit as we go forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Neil A. Russell", "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco's First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made on the course of this presentation that state the company or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

You can download a copy of the presentation by going to the Investors section of sysco.com.

The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation and can also be found in the Investors section of our website. In addition, all comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "Lastly, as many of you know, we recently rescheduled our Investor Day to May 17. We expect that the Investor Day will be held in New York City, but we'll provide an update on meeting location early next year.", "With that out of the way, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported net earnings of $303 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and earnings per share of $0.51. Sales increased 8.6% for the quarter, driven mainly by food cost inflation of 7.3%. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential increases in inflation.", "Case volume for the quarter was positive, but the growth rate remains modest in this difficult macroeconomic environment. Operating income for the quarter was $509 million, our highest first quarter on record. We're encouraged with these results at a time when the industry's as competitive as it has ever been.", "Our first quarter performance demonstrates our associates' commitment to focusing on our customers and managing costs. To get a clearer view of our underlying business performance, we believe it's helpful to exclude gross business transformation expenses and the impact of COLI. Looking at the results in this way, you'll see that while reported EPS was flat year-over-year, adjusted EPS grew 7.8% for the quarter, which is a result we are reasonably pleased with.", "We continue to believe that the food service industry will experience modest volume growth over the medium term. With that said, current industry trends appear to be flat at best. Thus, the approximately 2% case volume growth that we generated during the quarter in our business is encouraging.", "Looking forward, our focus remains on striking the right balance between volume growth, managing margins and controlling cost.", "Turning to our multiyear Business Transformation Project for a moment, we are implementing this month a significant system enhancement at our Arkansas location. We will then assess performance, address any concerns and move forward to our second facility. Once we have achieved a successful implementation at the second facility, we will update our rollout schedule and long-range projections of the cost and benefits of the project. It is imperative that we remain disciplined in our approach as we move forward to ensure that the larger rollout of future waves will be successful.", "Sysco is fortunate to have an outstanding leadership team. In that regard, last week, we announced changes in the responsibilities and the reporting structure for several of our senior executives. These changes reflect the strength and depth of the team and will enhance our ability to successfully execute our annual business plan, effectively implement our Business Transformation Project and accomplish our key strategic objectives. The changes include: Mike Green, Executive Vice President and Group President will assume responsibility for leading all Sysco operating companies. And Larry Pulliam, also Executive Vice President and Group President, will lead several key business support functions, including supply chain, information technology and business transformation, as well as contract sales and distribution services, which he currently has responsibility for. Both Mike and Larry will continue to report to me.", "In addition, we also recently announced that Fred Lankford, who previously served as President of Sysco Eastern Maryland, was promoted to Senior Vice President, Distribution Services for Sysco. Fred has over 30 years of operating company experience and will lead the development of an enterprise-wide approach to enhance our operational execution. In this new role, Fred will report to Larry Pulliam.", "In closing, I should note that while the pace and extent of the economic recovery remains uneven and difficult to predict, we are committed to being our customer's most valued business partner and to invest in the future growth of Sysco. This focus will serve us well by strengthening our competitive position and providing a strong foundation for success over the long term. We believe that Sysco's capabilities are unique in the industry and position us well to achieve our financial and strategic goals.", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the first quarter.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $10.6 billion or an increase of 8.6% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by higher prices. Prices were higher due to increasing levels of food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 7.3% for the quarter.", "In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.7%, and changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 0.7%. As Bill discussed a moment ago, case volume for the quarter increased nearly 2% year-over-year including acquisitions, or a little more than 1% excluding acquisitions.", "SYGMA's case growth was flat compared to double-digit growth in the prior year quarter, so all of the case growth we saw this quarter came in our Broadline organization.", "Turning to gross profit. I'd first like to make you aware of a change that is reflected in the results we announced today. Last year, we made the decision to reorganize our buy-in cooperative to streamline certain business functions and help us achieve the goals under our business transformation initiative. We completed the reorganization at the beginning of this fiscal year and the buy-in function now operates as a shared corporate cost center. As a result, we have reclassified certain centralized procurement costs from cost of sales to operating expenses. This change has the effect of enhancing transparency into our gross profits and operating expenses. The net effect of this change is an increase to both the gross profit and operating expense lines, averaging roughly $15 million to $20 million per quarter. Because these 2 increases net out to 0, there is no change to operating income or earnings.", "We have made these reclassifications retroactively, so the year-over-year variances previously reported on the gross profit and operating expense lines are not materially different. These changes are reflected in all financial information disclosed today. Tomorrow morning, shortly after filing our 10-Q, we'll also file an 8-K that provides our financial results on this new basis for the last 3 years.", "Gross profit increased 5.5% during the quarter, while gross margin decreased 53 basis points year-over-year to 18.4%. The decline in gross margin was due to high inflation rates combined with only modest volume growth. However, gross profit dollars per stop and per case increased once again.", "We remain focused on our cost structure. We understand that slow growth and high product cost may be a trend that stays with us for the foreseeable future, so we are committed to finding ways to improve our profitability in this environment. Managing our cost very tightly is one area of focus. Historically, Sysco has done a very good job of reducing its cost structure, and we believe we continue to have opportunities to do more.", "Operating expenses increased $98 million or 7.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of a $40 million increase in salaries and related costs due to increases in delivery and sales compensation, acquisitions, foreign exchange and growth in our Canadian Broadline operations, a $16 million increase in gross project expenses related to the company's Business Transformation Project and a $14 million increase in fuel expense, although it's important to note that fuel surcharges offset this increase entirely.", "In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we recently made changes to the investments underlying our COLI policies, which significantly reduce the volatility to our earnings. As a result, we had a $1 million gain this quarter, which was a period during which the market declined significantly. If we had not made this change, the impact from COLI during the quarter would have been substantially negative. While this is a positive result, the $1 million gain compares to a $14 million gain last year, creating a negative $13 million year-over-year variance for us this quarter compared to the prior year.", "The operating expense items I just discussed were partially offset by a $7 million decrease in expense related to the company's corporate-sponsored pension plan.", "Reported operating income increased $3 million or 0.6% for the fiscal quarter. As we discuss during our fourth quarter call, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, excluding the impact of the Business Transformation Project. Excluding gross business transformation expenses and the impact of COLI, adjusted operating expenses increased 5.3%, and adjusted operating income increased 6.1%.", "Net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 were $303 million, an increase of $3.6 million or 1.2% compared to the prior year. EPS for the first quarter was flat year-over-year on a reported basis at $0.51. Excluding gross business transformation expenses and COLI gains, adjusted EPS grew 7.8% to $0.55 compared to the prior year.", "So to summarize the first quarter performance in our underlying business, sales were up 8.6%, driven mainly by inflation; gross profits were up 5.5%; and adjusted operating expenses were up 5.3%, meaning we were able to leverage the gross profit growth and deliver more dollars to the bottom line.", "Adjusted operating income was up 6.1% and adjusted EPS was up 7.8%. As Bill said, we're reasonably pleased with these results given the current environment.", "Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment, in the first quarter, gross project expenses totaled $37 million, and we capitalized $45 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, gross project expenses totaled $21 million, and we capitalized $53 million related to the project.", "Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $255 million. In the prior year period, cash flow from operations was $227 million. We will pay the final $212 million in IRS settlement payments during the remainder of this fiscal year, with $106 million to be paid in the second quarter and $53 million to be paid in each of the last 2 quarters of the fiscal year.", "Capital expenditures totaled $227 million for the first quarter compared to $143 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by investments in facilities. This year, we are in the midst of constructing new facilities in Long Island, Boston and Central Texas, as well as a major expansion in Lincoln, Nebraska, compared to having only one such major project underway a year ago.", "There are a few guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 that I'd now like to update. First, as the price of fuel has eased somewhat over the last couple of months, we now expect an increase in fuel expense of $25 million to $35 million this year, which is roughly $10 million lower than our previous guidance. As a reminder, we implemented a fuel surcharge late during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, which is intended to mitigate the increase in fuel expense.", "Second, we continue to assess the appropriate timing to start construction on our third redistribution center or RDC. Given the macroeconomic conditions, as a result, it's unlikely we'll spend as much on it during the fiscal year of 2012 as previously anticipated. We are therefore reducing our CapEx estimates for the year by $50 million to a range of $700 million to $750 million.", "Lastly, we now expect our gross business transformation expenses for the year to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million. We expect the impact will increase each quarter, such that more than half of the total expenses will come in the second half of the year.", "In closing, while the macroeconomic environment continues to pressure our business, we are focused on managing our margins and costs and also on productivity improvements to mitigate these pressures. Sysco has built a seasoned team of professionals over the years that has the skills and experience to manage through these types of challenges. We believe that our capabilities and the investments we're making in our business will enable us to build on our industry leadership position over the long term.", "With that, operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take a question from Karen Short with BMO Capital.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Maybe can you just talk a little bit about, more of an update on the pilot in Arkansas and just talk about some of the kinks that you obviously were focused on in the fourth quarter, how those have worked out? And then also maybe some update on the timing of the rollout to the second opco?", "William J. DeLaney", "Karen, it's Bill. We can tell you some things and we're obviously right in the midst, as I mentioned, of putting in some of these enhancements this month in Arkansas. So the last time we would have talked with this group and internally for that matter, we said we were going to focus on Arkansas. We had some performance issues there, which kind of mean speed in terms of order process and that type of thing, and as well as some report issues and some inventory replenishment issues. So those are 3 basic things that we're addressing. And we're not addressing them all at this point in time. We've got a couple of those 3 that we're working through this month, and we hope to see some good progress there. And like I said in my prepared talk, we'll assess it at that point. And when we think we, that we're ready to go to the second company in a way that will work for our sales people and our employees and our customers, then we'll go. But I would hope it would be at some point early in the new calendar year. And then once we go through that pilot, really, the key to that pilot is just to confirm how well the system supports 2 companies, and the hope would be to get through that in good shape and then we'll reestablish what our rollout schedule would be.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just talking about sales throughout the quarter, I know you've kind of talked about the cadence in sales in the fourth quarter. Maybe it was looking a little bit better in June, but it wasn't clear. Can you just talk about your sales cadence throughout this quarter?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I think what we said last time, we saw -- generally, I mean, it's never the same in every company or every market, but generally, we saw a little bit of a flattening or a leveling out after Mother's Day, and it really didn't pick up in June. And I'd say that's continued into this quarter. What we were also concerned about is we got into this quarter when certainly the consumer sentiment that I spoke to from the standpoint of what went on in Washington in July and all that type of thing. So you guys all follow the consumer and many of you follow our industry, so if you've looked at that over the last 2, 3 months, you've seen the optimism of the consumer decline to some extent and that's been a concern. So we've experienced some of that although we're a little bit encouraged by what we've seen here in the last month, that some same type of surveys where it appears the consumer is becoming more optimistic again. So that's critical to us, it's great. We need the economy to grow and that's very important, but what's critical to our customers is that the consumer be in the right frame of mind to go out and enjoy a meal away from home and hopefully, people are gaining confidence again here ever so gradually and that should bode well for us and for our customers.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc., Research Division", "I just had a 2-part question on the current incentive structure for your marketing associates. So the first part of the question is, can you just maybe clarify some of the operating metrics that you think are the most relevant on how the marketing associates are incentivized right now? And then the other part of the question is, whatever those metrics might pertain to, whether that's gross profit per delivery or cases per trip or pieces per trip, did you see any improvement last quarter sequentially? And also based on your earlier comparisons, is that something you can comment on at all?", "William J. DeLaney", "Let me take the first one, Ajay, you may have to come back to me on the second one. So really, the way we compensate our MAs hasn't changed dramatically. And it does coincide with what, at least, what I would view as one of our top key economic metrics for the business. So there's a lot of key metrics, but certainly one of the top 2 or 3 would be gross profit dollars per delivery. And our MAs, once they reach a point that they're on full commission, they are paid off of gross profit, but off of gross profit per delivery. So they're pretty well aligned in terms of the basic economics. Certainly, there's opportunities over time to continue to assess that. And in addition to how we compensate people, we also recognize people, and that's a big thing within Sysco and it's certainly a big thing with our sales managers, our MAs. So certainly growth and quality growth at the territory level has always been very much emphasized within Sysco, and we continue to look for ways to keep that at the top of our list as well. The second question?", "Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc., Research Division", "Yes. So Bill, I think in terms of your prepared comments, you mentioned that volumes are -- it sounded like they decelerated a little bit since last quarter. So I guess in that context, the metrics by which you incentivize the MAs, have those metrics improved, like both in the context of last quarter...", "William J. DeLaney", "I try to be a little more bullish here in my comments, but actually,  don't think I said that. I think what I'm trying to say is we saw some volume growth and we're pleased with that. And we saw some -- the real volume growth as you can calculate was flat, but we did try to show you that we saw some case growth in the core business and that's encouraging. But at the same time, it remains very competitive out there. So I would say to you going back to Karen's question that the volume trends we're seeing in our business are pretty comparable to what we've seen in the last couple of quarters. The market is -- the market's, I would say, also about the same, and the consumer sentiment, like I mentioned, really did tail off here in July and August, and it appears it might be coming back a little bit. So we didn't see any material changes in terms of gross profit per delivery or miles or any of that type of thing.", "Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then in relation to ERP, it looks like, even based on your updated outlook for this year, looks like you're already on track to maybe exceed that original $900 million budget by the end of fiscal '12. So it looks like between the operating expenses and CapEx, the cumulative total would be in -- it would still be in excess of $1 billion by the end of the year. Is that correct?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "You're kind of comparing apples and oranges there, Ajay. The $900 million, which we used to refer to was an overall cash number, but there were a number of things as we've talked about, including our Sysco Business Services that weren't included in that number because we always assume there'd be a netting against them from benefits. So what we're talking about -- obviously, we've spent an amount of cash already. We're continuing to spend cash on the project rollout, but it's very difficult to compare where we are versus that number and draw a conclusion. That's one of the reasons why we went to the, what I think is a totally transparent, here are the gross expenses, and we'll update you on the benefits as we go forward.", "Ajay Jain - Hapoalim Securities USA, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But on a gross expense basis, is that -- am I still conceptually right that it's -- you're sort of on track to be in a $900 million to $1 billion range by the end of this year?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "The gross amount of expenses that we've incurred for the projects will obviously be over $900 million, yes. All I'm saying is, I'm not comparing them back to that original $900 million. It's a bit of a -- again, it's comparing it against something that wasn't reflective of what we're now telling you the numbers are.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, Ajay, I would just take you back to our last call, where we talked about our timeline, and we're 6 to 12 months behind and more than likely that could translate into additional cost. But until we get through Arkansas and the next pilot facility, it's very difficult to address that question with any accuracy.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I'm sorry for this question upfront, but I actually don't understand. So you're talking about case volume growth in the core business, so 1%, 2% whatever that number is, but real growth is being flat, which you can see if you take your sales and adjust for inflation and acquisitions and currency. So what's the difference between the 2 of those?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "They're just different numbers. The real growth is an industry calculation that we had heard for years and years. We actually started putting it into our releases about maybe about 3 or 4 quarters ago because we knew everybody did the calculation, so we thought we'd make it easy. It's not perfectly reflective of case volume growth. It's always directionally correct. It's sometimes very close, but it's just not the same number. Case growth is a real number that we look at that just is a -- we calculate how many cases we deliver this year versus the last year, and what you're looking at is just again a definitional calculation which is sometimes pretty close.", "William J. DeLaney", "I think, I guess as the long-term guide here, for years, we've talked around real growth in terms of inflation and the impact of acquisitions, and once we have Canada, the FX impact. So it's a long-running statistic or set of statistics that we've always provided. We've run the business off the cases, and so we're just trying to give you a couple of different ways of looking at it. To Chris' point, they're not significantly different, but we thought it was worth, at least sharing that with you.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes. I mean, one of the things, not to belabor it, but one of the things that's in that real growth calculation is ForEx, and you really have to scratch your head and think about whether ForEx should be in a calculation that tries to get underlying case growth. But again, we've provided you what we think you all calculate in the past, and this time, we thought we better provide you the real volume growth because it is pretty different.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And can you update us on your outlook for inflation over the next few quarters?", "William J. DeLaney", "Sure.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Well, let's get out the crystal ball.", "William J. DeLaney", "That won't take long. Now look, you've seen it gradually trend up from 3% to 5% to 7%, and it was -- we had it across many categories again this quarter. Certainly, the dairy and meat and seafood led the charge. But our largest categories are canned and dry and frozen, and we saw meaningful inflation there as well. So that's how you end up with a number as high as 7%. So our best sense, and I wouldn't go out anymore than a couple of quarters is that, it's with us here for a while. I wouldn't be surprised if it mitigated somewhat, but I wouldn't expect it to dramatically decline here over the next couple of quarters.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And where do you see inflation from a product standpoint? Does that impact your ability to pass it through? So for instance, there's been some talk about, I guess, meat pricing going up beginning of the year. Is that a more difficult category to pass it through for you or is it pretty much the same everywhere?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, meat's tough, just because those cases cost a lot to begin with. Those are expensive cases. So when you have 6%, 8%, 12% inflation, that just makes it a bigger ticket item for the customer. But in general, they're all -- it's all difficult when you've got 6% or 8% or sometimes by category double-digit price increase or cost increases for us at a time when our operators are still struggling to get traffic into their businesses. So we're in a different time. We've managed inflation of this type in the past, we've managed it well. It's harder this time and as I said before, I think there's an obvious reason for that, which is just the, what we're coming back from in terms of the economy, people's psyches, it's just more difficult. So I don't know that it's category-specific, but when you get into high single-digit, low double-digit cost increases, those are difficult for people to swallow in a short span of time. We do pass it along over time, but the bigger the number, the longer it takes.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just last question for you, your D&A was down, I guess, modestly year-over-year. I don't know if you can help us there. And then you've been capitalizing costs on SAP, and I was curious as to when the amortization on that would actually end up starting?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, the way we're looking at the project or the machine, as I keep referring to it is, once we're out of the pilot stage and we're actually into the implementation stage, we will begin to amortize it. I mean, internally, we've assumed that when we get past the second pilot, that, that's when it will happen. And I think I've said in the last call that in our internal plans, we do assume that we'll start depreciating it this year. So in the numbers that we've given you, we do have an assumption that we'll start depreciating the project this year. We've not been specific about what month, but we've said it will begin this year.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. But that's when the second pilot is complete, that's right?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, when we've put the second pilot in, and we've assessed that it does indeed work, and we're going to start a rollout process, and that's when we'll declare the machine to be ready and fit for implementation.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just to stand back here. If you take the business transformation cost out, do you think you can actually grow earnings this year?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. I mean, we grew it this quarter. That's the plan, I guess we're trying to make, Mark, that we did grow operating income about 6% this quarter. If you take that and the COLI out, which I think is fair in terms of this type of a perspective. So I'm a little cautious in terms of the environment and that type of thing, but that's certainly what we're planning to do.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And if you leave them all in, if we leave -- it's like almost a $0.26 to $0.28 drag, you leave that in versus the $0.11 drag last year, do you think the earnings numbers is up on that basis?", "William J. DeLaney", "Mark, that's not fair. I'll let Chris take that one.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, I think we call that guidance. Mark, look, I'll go back to your first question. You're hitting on the point that we've been trying to make, which is, we understand we're responsible for business transformation, and we've got a lot of very, very quality people working on that, we're managing the costs appropriately, but we're not going to avoid spending money and do the wrong thing on that project. What we're trying to make sure people understand and remember that there's an underlying business here, and we have to keep that underlying business growing. And so we're trying to give you the numbers you need to show that we are indeed continuing to grow the underlying business. It's hard, but as Bill said, we do believe we can continue growing the underlying business.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And by quarter here, so it sounds like a big back half weighting here on the remaining business transformation for the year. Can you give us any help on the individual quarters on what those are going to look like?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, we're really not going to break it down by quarter. Look, this is just me talking. We've been doing pretty good to give you guys rough estimates for the year and some would say we haven't done that good a job at that. So to break it down by quarter, the ranges would be very, very wide. Look, the meat of this year will be when we get through the pilot and we start to roll out. That's going to be where the expense picks up because that's when we'll have both depreciation kicking in and implementation teams kicking in. So that's why we make the comment, we'll be heavier in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And do you think the high watermark for expense is going to be next year or is it this year?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I'm going to have to hold off on that one, only because we continue to relook at the number. And it may sound like it's taking us a while. The reality is we need to get through the second pilot and reassess the implementation plan, the rollout schedule, before we really have a good view on the next few years. And our goal is to be able to talk about that in the spring, as we said the last time around. So maybe you can give us a little more time before we can give you a multiyear look on that.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And just outside of the gross margin pressure from inflation, how do you think the other factors there? What's going on with price competition and just the overall competitive environment?", "William J. DeLaney", "Look, it's very hard to separate inflation from price competition, from the challenges in the marketplace that our customers are working in. So I would stick with what we said here, Mark, which is -- I would characterize the competitive environment as, as strong as it's ever been, and I probably have been saying that for the better part of the 1.5 years to 2 years, and I don't think it's let up.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A couple of things, if I may. Firstly, I mean, I guess it looks like, I mean, I guess being a restaurant analyst, I mean what you're seeing is your customers are ordering less expensive food this year versus last year. And that would explain the difference between case volume and real sales, I suppose? I mean, is that a phenomenon that, I mean, that you're kind of seeing across the industry? I mean, is it located in certain pockets? I mean, maybe on the lower end and is there anything that you can do to kind of prevent that, perhaps some investments in the types of products that they're not ordering year-on-year?", "William J. DeLaney", "John, I'm Bill. I think from a logic standpoint, your theory is plausible, but it certainly is not necessarily the whole reason why you might see a difference. Again, we're not talking about a large difference so I would say over the last 2 to 3 years, our customers have taken a very hard look at their spending budgets and have focused very much on being economical with their purchases and still having a consistent quality of offering for their patrons. So I don't know that I can tell you that they're offering less expensive food this year. There's other things that can be driving that as well like mix. And these calculations, we do them across all of our companies. They're not precise like a scientist would be precise. So I wouldn't overplay that difference there too much. So that could be a contributing cause, but if that is, I don't think it's a new phenomena, I guess, is my point. The second part of your question?", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Regarding SYGMA. I mean, I'm assuming that inflation number is somewhere near right for SYGMA. I mean, it does look like it was -- I mean, if that's flat, probably negative case volume or real sales, whatever you want to call it, in SYGMA in the quarter. And it's not really what we're seeing in the industry. I mean, it seems like traffic is at worst about flat across the industry for the September quarter. So I just wanted to get a sense of whether there's -- whether you're intentionally giving up some business or if there are some flow of, from customers in and out of that segment that we should be aware of.", "William J. DeLaney", "No, I think our SYGMA business is in line with what you just said in terms of, if you will, our comp for same-store sales, that type of thing. With SYGMA, we've had a nice little spurt here over the last 1.5 or 2 years. We've brought on some customers. We're running the business a lot better and SYGMA is going to ebb and flow a little bit based upon bringing in new accounts and that type of thing. So we haven't lost any major customers. We just kind of wrapped the period of time and we haven't bought any large ones on either. But I would agree with you that kind of the same-store part comp, if you will, is about flat in what we're seeing in that side of the business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.", "Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Why do you guys think maybe the Broadline business did a little bit better, particularly with soft consumer confidence? I mean, are those, some of those, I would think some of the pricing might be a little bit higher than kind of the, more of the chain business?", "William J. DeLaney", "Better than SYGMA, is that what you're getting at, Greg?", "Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, yes, better than yes, I would think just from a pricing perspective maybe there's a little bit price points in that Broadline business.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I think I'll stick with the answer I just gave John. I don't think it's -- they're just 2 different businesses in terms of, we're always bringing on new business in the Broadline, and SYGMA tends to be a little bit more volatile as far as that goes. So I don't have a great insight in terms of that. It's not that much difference, to be honest with you, in terms of how we look at the numbers. But we're pleased with what the Broadline is doing. We're growing it both on the contracts side and in the street. We're just not seeing the volume growth that we'd like to see.", "Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right, right, yes. And just from a business transformation purpose, is there anything next quarter that's different than this quarter? I mean, is it going to be around $0.04? Or without giving guidance, but I mean, is there anything that we should consider, if there's any type of step up next quarter?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "We're not going to give any guidance. So it's really hard for me to answer that question. I'll go back to what I said earlier and I'm sorry, but we just can't give you much guidance. But as we said, and I'll now weave in what Bill said earlier, we are, this month, making some upgrades and enhancements to Arkansas, and he said early in the calendar year, we would hope to go into our second pilot site, so that actually gets you past the second quarter. And what I've said is that, once we go into pilot side and we make sure that, that works, then we would start amortizing and then we would reassess the rollout, and that's where the expenses would really start to kick in. So to the extent that you want some sort of insight, that's probably the best we can give you.", "Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, all right, okay. And then just generally in terms of -- were there any changes in terms of mix or menu price over the last few months? Or has it been pretty, kind of status quo versus kind of what you saw in the second calendar quarter?", "William J. DeLaney", "I don't think there's any big changes one way or another.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "I wanted to follow-up on the trading down and the differential and I know -- it was nice of you to give that information, I know there's some estimation in such large organizations. But I think from your answer to John, I would take away that you're probably saying there's a little stickiness in passing through some of this rapid inflation? Is that fair to say and that's sort of market driven?", "William J. DeLaney", "Say that again, Andy?", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Well, the 1% differential that you talked about in case volume to the calculated real sales? If it's not from trading down, I was thinking about this too. If it's not from trading down, then it's probably because the inflation you're actually increasing your cost, your pricing by is a little lower than your product cost.", "William J. DeLaney", "Possibly. I think all I'm saying is, we're talking about a directional move here that's comparable, and the difference between the 2 is not to me overly significant. So I wouldn't overanalyze that particular difference. We're just trying to give you a feel for cases, and so I guess I'll just leave it at that. I think we're seeing some case growth we're having to invest in price a little bit to get it, and we're managing our expenses reasonably well, but as I said in my comments, we have an opportunity to do all 3 a little bit better here as we go forward in the year.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Andrew, I want to jump in because I don't want folks to fixate on some 1% number. I think when you back out ForEx, we're talking less than half a point that is explained in terms of the difference between those 2 numbers. And as we keep saying, they're never exact, they've never been exact as long we have watched them, they're usually directionally correct. So I wouldn't spend too much time trying to explain away the half-point differential.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "But you do think the 1% real case estimate for the organization is pretty close? We don't have to -- we should consider that, right?", "William J. DeLaney", "I'd say that's closer than the other because we actually can see that.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, I mean, it's a little better than a point after excluding acquisitions and that's our real volume.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Got it. And is that coming more from penetration or new customers or could it just be your customers are doing better than the industry and you have good selection, positive selection volumes.", "William J. DeLaney", "We'd like to think that, but when you do the amount of business that we do, our overall results are going to reflect the industry to a large extent. I'd say when you take it down to cases, I'd go back to what would appear to us that the market's relatively flat, we're seeing that at the customer level, and so what you're seeing here is the new cases coming in and faster than loss cases are going out, which is a good thing. I mean, we're working very hard on that.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "You think it's your lines as you look at invoices, are the amount of lines going up, penetration?", "William J. DeLaney", "We don't really show that number, probably any of that.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And I just wanted to ask the inflation question. You're not the only folks. Some of the food retailers are also talking about mitigation, and some are using the word hope, and you guys talked about a crystal ball, and I mean, I don't blame you for nobody really knows especially where things are at. But is there any -- first of all, when you define mitigation, are you talking about just a lower rate of inflation or are you actually think there could be some sequential lower prices, maybe in some of the big commodity groups? Which -- what would be mitigation to you?", "William J. DeLaney", "I said mitigation, and I'll see it in the transcript here at some point, I probably should have said that it would subside, the rate of inflation. We would hate using that word hope, so I think the best case for us, as you know very well, best case for our customers and for us is 2 or 3 points of inflation. I don't see that coming in the next couple of quarters, but it would be nice if the 7% turns out to be the high watermark and that it subsides here as we go through the next several months. It's really hard to predict beyond that though.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And are any of the futures markets are in forward contracts that you can enter into? Are any of these at kind of lower inflation rates? Is there any hard evidence at this point that there might be some?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, in some of the commodities if you go out and if you look at the numbers year-over-year, there's a little bit of a lessening, I guess, if you will the inflationary pressures, but not a lot. And so we typically don't go out and do a lot of forwards on commodities, and I don't expect that we'll do that anytime soon. Again, our whole model is predicated on as a marketer and distributor, being able to pass along these cost increases. And to some extent, we're in unprecedented times here, but I wouldn't expect us to start doing a lot of forward speculating.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So a couple of things. The lower business transformation expense this year, is that simply a timing issue that it gets pushed out to next year? Or is that a true reduction in cost?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "That's really just firming up our estimates from earlier in the year. When we were putting together our plans and guidance for the year, we were kind of in the middle of still reading the results from Arkansas. So we put together the best numbers we thought, and as we've gone through the first quarter, we've been able to true those up. So at this point, I'm just going to say, the true up in the numbers.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "But you were conservative -- or you were conservative before that -- this is where we're coming out now?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I would say we were probably erring on the side a bit on conservatism, and I'm not going to say that it won't be a timing issue. Again, we're holding off on giving you further out guidance until we got a chance to read the second pilot and finish our rollout. But right now, I'll just say, it's a true up for 2012 and that's pretty much the best view I've got.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. Now Bill, on price elasticity, if we end up a year from now with inflation of 2% or 3% or something like that, what's your sense on price elasticity and how much of that helps unit demand? Or in this macro does it not help much?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well historically, it's helped, John, as you well know. Historically, whether it's a mindset or elasticity or whatever when you have lower levels of inflation, our trends would tell you, our historical trends would tell you, we're able to grow our boxes a little bit more. I think that's though because that the operator that we're selling to is in a better place in terms of their business and in terms of their outlook. So time will tell, but I would still say that we would be better served, and our customers will be better served if we can get to that lower level of inflation, the 2 or 3 points. And I just think people's outlooks will be better in that kind of environment. So I would much rather see that. It would be good to get there in the right way, and not get there too fast, but I would think that, that's a better scenario for us.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "But there's not a 1:1 relationship, right? If inflation backs off 400 basis points, we'd probably don't see a 400 basis point improvement in unit demand?", "William J. DeLaney", "No, I don't think you do. And I would, double on what I had given -- just given the world that we operate in today, which is much different than one we operated in 4 or 5 years ago, so I would not make that leap.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. Then finally, if you think you just talked about other opportunities to reduce cost. When you look at the growth in payroll, is that primarily, is that hours, is it cost per hour and where is there opportunity if you think there is to bring that increase down?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think there's a couple levels of opportunity. One is, I mentioned Fred coming on board here and working with Larry on rolling out this enterprise-wide enhanced operational support work, if you will. So you watched us over a lot of years, so we've gone from basically pretty much letting the operating companies do whatever they want, to do operationally, to best practice websites, to integrated delivery models, to now we're just kind of trying to strike a better balance between what the OpCos can see through their prism locally, where they can make improvements in terms of the productivity, and what we might be able to see across the entire enterprise. And so, I think over the medium-term, there continues to be opportunity, like we've created over the last 3 or 4 years, where you've seen our productivity improve nicely, both in the warehouse and in delivery, and I think that continues to be that type of opportunity going forward. And keep in mind, that was all part of the umbrella -- under the umbrella of business transformation. It just didn't happen to be part of the SAP component of it. So I think that's a kind of a medium-term opportunity ongoing for us. And then secondly, I've said this before and I don't mean to be oversimplified or trite, but I think anytime you've got 500 people coming to work together every day, anytime you got 200 people in operations and a sales force of 100 people, there's always opportunity to mobilize those folks in a more efficient way. So we do a great job, I think we do better than most, if not all. But when you have that many transactions, that many cases and pilots coming in and going out every day, there's always opportunities to manage the business and little bit better, and that's certainly what we're working on very hard here.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your staffing for marketing associates. There was a time where I think everybody thought the economy was going to improve more quickly, and I know you didn't want to be behind in terms of training marketing associates. When you look where you are now, do you just think that you need to make some changes in the staffing?", "William J. DeLaney", "Meredith, it's Bill. I actually think we're in a pretty good place right now. We have gone through a transition to your point over the last 12 to 18 months. Where I think some of our operating companies, got behind or maybe cut a little bit more than, in retrospect, than we would've liked to have cut. But as I look at our numbers today, we're up modestly in terms of MAs, and we're up about, what the cases are up, and we're up about what our expectations for case growth are, so I think we're in a pretty good place there.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, that's great. And then I think this is beating a dead horse, but if you were to start depreciating the business transformation cost, saying, let's just make this up in the fourth quarter and you were also going to start to have the actual expenses of the rollout should be running through the P&L. Can you give us some idea of, based on what you know today, what that would do to earnings per share?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Well, we've given you the full year guidance on that, Meredith, which includes both those items. So we updated it today, of course, $250 million to $275 million of expense for the year. You can make your own assumption on how much of that is the first half versus the back half of the year. Included in that is depreciation and the expensing of the items, and so roughly $10 million per $0.01 per share, that would be the impact on our earnings per share.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, I'm sorry I didn't realize that, that included the D&A component in it.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, it's all expensed.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Erin Lash with MorningStar.", "Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I had -- I wanted to go back to some of the strategic pricing initiatives that you've talked about over the past couple of quarters. I don't think that you mentioned it this time around, and I was wondering if you could give us an update or a little bit more detail on that.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, Erin, this is Chris. I didn't mention it frankly because it wasn't a significant impact at all. We -- that number or the impact of that number on our gross margin has declined the last couple of quarters as we've discussed, to the point where it's not really, it's not something we're going to call out because it's not material. So the translation -- we're starting to see the impact that we wanted to see. We're starting to see the benefits on those geographies that were rolled out earlier, offsetting the geographies that we rolled out later in the process.", "Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Right, thank you, that's helpful. Following up, I'm pretty sure that you mentioned this about a year ago. But could you remind us what the impact is regarding the timing of the holidays, meaning with Christmas and New Year's falling on Sundays for the upcoming -- in the current quarter, how that impacts your case volumes versus if they were to fall on a weekday?", "William J. DeLaney", "Okay, I'll take a shot at that one. It's actually better if it falls on a Sunday because that's a normal day off, obviously, for most of our people. The reality is though that they get holidays. There's the expense side of this, so we'll incur some extra cost anytime you have a holiday week, especially a big one like Christmas or New Year's the following week. So the reality is Christmas, in particular, is a time where at some point that weekend, people stop going out. So in the case of Sunday, we'll do a little better because you'll have Christmas Eve, most people though pretty much shut it down by noon on Saturday. So it could help us a little bit. I think the holidays fall at the same time this year as last year. I'll have Neil come back to you on that if that's different. But I think in terms of what weeks they fall in, it's the same. And Erin, that's probably more important, to be honest with you, in terms of the week as opposed to the day of the week.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I think that's where we gave you some guidance a year ago because actually one of the quarters had one less holiday than the prior year, one had one more holiday than the prior year, so we did the adjustment to help you out with that.", "Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just finally, any update on the acquisition pipeline or premiums that sellers are potentially looking at? Or should we assume that most of your focus is going towards the business transformation and not on the acquisitions at this point?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, we continue to spend a great deal of amount of time working on acquisitions. We've got a small team of people, and then we've got a large group of people out in the field that one of their roles is to continue to source potential acquisitions. So the pipeline is reasonably robust. We don't announce every deal that we do. We tend to make an announcement involving 3 or 4 deals that we've done. We'll continue to say that most of these are smaller-ish transactions given our size. Most things are going to be smaller transactions, but we'll keep doing them. And the first part of your question in terms of pricing, it's really about the same. We're pretty disciplined in our approach. We don't feel we overpay for anything. We like to be fair, but we continue to see owners of companies that are at a point where they're ready to exit the business, come forward and we're typically able to get to an agreement on pricing and we move on down the path towards closure.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Bob Cummins from Wellington Shields & Co.", "Robert Cummins - Shields & Company", "My question just happened to be also on acquisitions. I see that you did spend $36 million on acquisitions in this quarter, so you're not standing still. But it also occurs to me in the current environment that there might be and particularly in areas of the country where you have a relatively small market share, there may be more acquisition opportunities and perhaps of a larger size that you might consider doing. Can you kind of give me a sense of whether you see more people looking to sell out their businesses around the country and what your strategy would be? You still have a relatively small market share nationwide.", "William J. DeLaney", "Bob, thanks for pointing that out. But the reality is, the market share moves around depending on the market. So as you go to 17% nationwide statistic, there's markets where we have considerably more than that and to your point, there's markets where we have less. So we are seeing, to Chris' point, we are seeing and have seen over the last year or so and I think we're being more effective and proactive, some fold-in opportunities, which, Bob, I think could be the more likely scenario for us. So there are some bigger players out there. We don't have the sense that they're overly interested in selling their businesses right now, but certainly we'd be open to talking to them. But I think the bigger opportunity is on the smaller to midsize competitors. And to your point, in markets where we do have more opportunity to grow our share.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, I'll weigh in there, Bob. I mean, we're looking everywhere. We have folks working everywhere. I hate to say it like this, but we'll talk to anybody if they're interested in selling. So we don't necessarily focus on areas where we've got low market share although in certain markets, Los Angeles or Southern California we're under-penetrated, we announced a deal there within the last year, a decent sized deal to help us out. We'll certainly look in those areas, but we don't look exclusively in those areas. We'll look at transactions anywhere we can find them.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.2 billion for the second quarter, a 9.2% increase. Net earnings for the quarter were $250 million, and EPS was $0.43. Excluding the year-over-year impact of gross business transformation expenses and COLI investment income, EPS was $0.46. On this basis, which we believe is more representative of the performance of our underlying business, EPS grew 2.2% for the quarter. ", "Overall market conditions remained soft for much of the second quarter but appeared to strengthen during the holiday season. Our case growth trends improved as the quarter progressed, as we aggressively supported our customers, protected our business, grew our share of wallet with existing customers and brought on new accounts. As a result, case volume growth during the second quarter was 2.8% excluding the impact of acquisitions and 3.6% including acquisitions. ", "Based on recent industry data, we believe we grew our market share by about half -- excuse me, by about 0.5 point during calendar year 2011 to approximately 17.5%. Food cost inflation remained at historically high levels and approximated 6.3% for the quarter. While slightly lower than the level we experienced in the first quarter, this type of inflationary environment is difficult for our customers and provides us with significant pricing challenges. ", "Although we are encouraged by our recent volume growth trends, earnings growth from our underlying business for the quarter fell short of our expectations as expenses grew at a faster rate than did gross profit dollars. Our leadership team is addressing the internal factors that limited our earnings growth, and we expect to see gradual improvement over the next few quarters. ", "In addition, we are currently developing several key strategic initiatives that will better position Sysco to profitably grow our market share in the years to come. One such initiative that is now in the early stage of implementation is our multiyear Business Transformation Project. Last April, we went live at our pilot facility in Arkansas. Following a successful weekend cutover, we subsequently experienced several system performance challenges, including the following: timely order entry processing; effective balancing of service and inventory levels, as well as efficient and user-friendly reports. ", "This past November, we implemented several enhancements, and Arkansas has subsequently seen improvement in all of these areas. We are now more comfortable with the system's performance and recently went live at our second pilot facility in Oklahoma. The key goal of this pilot is to ensure that the new system can support multiple operating companies. ", "While we are still assessing early results, preliminary indicators from Oklahoma are encouraging. Assuming system performance remains satisfactory, we will continue our preparation to launch the first wave of multiple operating companies before the end of the fiscal year. Upon concluding that the system is capable of supporting a broader rollout, we will update our timeline and long-range projections for the cost and benefits of the project. We hope to provide that update at our Investor Day in May. ", "Reflecting for a moment on the first half of fiscal 2012, we are most appreciative of the efforts of our 47,000 associates who support the ongoing success of our broad and diverse customer base. To a large extent, our performance in the second half of the year will be heavily influenced by how much the recent uptick in consumer confidence translates into increased consumer spending on meals away from home, as well as our ability to better leverage our case growth. ", "Looking beyond the current fiscal year, we remain bullish about our opportunities as the pre-eminent leader in the $225 billion U.S. and Canadian foodservice market. Specifically, we remain committed to strengthening our customer relationships, reducing our cost structure and pursuing attractive opportunities to expand beyond our core business. ", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $10.2 billion or an increase of 9.2% compared to the prior year, driven mainly by food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 6.3% for the period. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.7%, and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.1%. ", "Case volume for the quarter increased 3.6% year-over-year including acquisitions or 2.8% excluding acquisitions. We saw solid increases in volumes across all areas of our business. ", "Gross profit increased 4.8% during the quarter. Even though gross margin decreased 75 basis points year-over-year to 18%, gross profit dollars per stop and per case increased once again. Operating expenses increased $94 million or 7.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of a $58 million increase in salaries and related costs. The most significant factor impacting this variance was an $18 million increase in management incentive accruals. And last year's second quarter, we had reduced these performance-based accruals, which now creates a meaningful year-over-year difference when compared to this year's accrual. In addition, we saw increases in salaries and related expense due to delivery and sales compensation, acquisitions and volume growth that has increased pay for activity-based positions. ", "Also impacting operating expenses were a $12 million increase in gross business transformation expenses, a $10 million increase in fuel expense. It's important to note that fuel surcharges offset this increase, although they are reflected in gross profits, and a $9 million lower benefit from COLI. These operating expense items were partially offset by a $7 million decrease in expense related to the company's corporate-sponsored pension plan. ", "Reported operating income decreased $10 million or 2.3%, and net earnings for the second quarter were $250 million, a decrease of $8 million or 3.1% compared to the prior year. As we discussed during our first quarter call, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, excluding the impact of the Business Transformation Project and the impact of COLI, which had a minimal positive impact this year but had a significantly more positive impact in fiscal 2011 periods. ", "Excluding gross business transformation expenses and the impact of COLI, adjusted operating expenses increased 5.5%, and adjusted operating income increased 2.5%. Net earnings on this basis grew 3.3% to $272 million, and EPS grew 2.2% to $0.46 per share. ", "Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, gross project expenses totaled $36 million, and we capitalized $33 million related to the project. In the prior year period, gross project expenses totaled $24 million, and we capitalized $51 million related to the project. ", "As Bill discussed earlier, we have made a lot of progress over the last few months. We installed enhancements to the system in Arkansas, our first pilot location. We went live in Oklahoma, our second pilot location, and we have begun preparations to move forward with our first wave of multiple operating companies, which should occur prior to the end of our fiscal year. ", "While we are continuing to assess the results of the Oklahoma implementation, which will ultimately determine the timing of our deployment plan, I wanted to remind you that once we are confident that the system in Oklahoma is operating as intended and it is ready to deploy more broadly, we will begin to depreciate the project costs that have been capitalized to date. We currently anticipate that we'll reach this point late in our third fiscal quarter. Once we do, project expenses will ramp up quite significantly, and capitalized costs will similarly decline significantly. I will provide our latest estimate for 2012 expense and capital in just a few minutes. ", "Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first half of the fiscal year was $539 million. In the prior year period, cash flow from operations was $283 million. As a reminder, we are paying the final $212 million in IRS tax settlement payments during this fiscal year. Due to the timing of these payments during our fiscal year, there was no cash impact on our first fiscal quarter, a $106 million cash outflow occurred in the second fiscal quarter, and a $53 million cash outflow will occur in each of the third and fourth fiscal quarters. ", "Cash flow from operations improved by $227 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year, due mainly to improved working capital and the redemption of COLI policies. Working capital improved during the quarter due mainly to improved days outstanding for accounts payable. The redemption of the COLI policies was an element of our previously discussed plan to reduce the market-driven COLI impact on our earnings. The redeemed COLI policies were replaced by less volatile corporate-owned real estate assets. ", "Capital expenditures totaled $207 million for the second quarter and $434 million for the first half. This year, we are constructing new facilities in Long Island, Boston and Central Texas, as well as a major expansion in Lincoln, Nebraska, compared to having only 1 such major project underway a year ago. ", "During the quarter, we renewed our unfavorable terms, our $1 billion credit facility, which supports our highly rated commercial paper facility. ", "Before closing, there are a few guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 that I'd like to update. First, we now expect an increase in fuel expense of $30 million to $40 million this year, which is roughly $5 million higher than our previous guidance and is primarily driven by higher projected fuel prices. As a reminder, we implemented a fuel surcharge with a broader customer base late during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, which is intended to mitigate the increase in fuel expense. ", "Second, we now expect the capitalized spend on our Business Transformation Project this year to be $125 million to $145 million. This is roughly $25 million higher than our previous estimate, primarily because we have been able to capitalize more costs than anticipated and we're purchasing more hardware than originally forecast. In addition, we expect gross business transformation expenses for the year to be approximately $230 million to $250 million, which is roughly $20 million lower than previous estimates because of a slower ramp-up of our shared services center, requiring fewer resources than originally projected in this fiscal year. Increased capitalization of costs also contributed to this decline in the estimate. ", "In closing, while trends in our business continue to be uneven and difficult to predict, we are encouraged by the level of case growth this quarter and our continued ability to increase our market share. We are taking actions in many areas to improve profitability in both the near term and the long term and believe Sysco's unique capabilities and commitment to ongoing investment in our business provide a solid foundation for future growth. ", "With that, operator, we will now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from John Heinbockel, Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of things. So first thing, so business picked up towards the end of the quarter. Has that continued thus far in January? Obviously, weather has been good in a lot of parts of the country, and sentiment has been good. So has that persisted here or have we slid back?", "William J. DeLaney", "I'd say it's persisted. It's early, John. You know us real well so you know this quarter is a hard quarter to trend line anything this early. March drives the disproportionate amount of the volume and the earnings for the quarter. But there's some phenomenons going on. You haven't heard us talk much about whether last year or this year in terms of it hurting us or helping us. I would say a couple of things this year, we had some bad weather where you normally don't have bad weather last year in the south, so that's going to help us here or did help us in January. We did have the holiday kick in into the first quarter, so those kind of offset. So I'd say net-net, the weather has been good relative to last year. The only caveat to that would be, we haven't seen a lot of snow in some of the ski resort areas. So some of those opcos that depend on that business side, they're not seeing that. But net-net, I would say the trends have continued on the top line.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then the -- so you talk about things you can do to improve profitability near and long term. So talk about 2 things, one, away from SAP, where do you think there might be some cost containment opportunity? And then secondly, is there anything pre-SAP that can be done on pricing in terms of, well, you may not be optimizing your pricing geographically by customer category, whatever?", "William J. DeLaney", "Okay. Well, those may connect here. If I don't handle the second one, come back to me on that. So what I'm really alluding to there, John, as you look at this thing, clearly, this isn\u2019t a typical Sysco quarter in terms of what we were able to leverage or not leverage. And so in the short term, there are just some basic things that we need to readdress and to bring a little bit more intensity to. So basically, we need to flip the gross profit dollar growth and the expense growth. So if we can get to where the gross profit dollars are growing 5% to 6% to 7% and the expenses are growing 4% to 5%, then we'll be fine. Now how do you do that? Clearly, we need to continue to work really close with our customers and understand that the value package has worked in both ways in terms of the service and the pricing. And then internally, we saw pressure on productivity, in operations, in particular, in the transportation side, even x fuel and, to some extent, in selling. So selling, potentially some of that has continued to invest in the sales force. But there's opportunities for us just to manage the business a little bit better here, I think, on the cost side and get our productivity improvement to go along with the cost improvement. So I don't want to sound too clich\u00e9-ish here, but there are some blocking and tackling fundamentals here that we need to improve somewhat here over the second half of the year. As far as the pricing, we are, in different ways, and have been for the last year or 2, working with some different forms of what, I guess, would be characterized as scientific pricing. We have -- as we have moved into this stage of the business transformation work, we have looked at opportunities to decouple some of the things that were essentially integrated into the software, whether it be CRM -- we've talked a little bit about inside sales. Pricing would be another one. I'm not going to tell you today that there's anything imminent there, but that's certainly -- I would put that more into the long-term strategic initiative bucket that I talked about, along with strengthening some of our supplier relationships, a more fundamental look at our cost structure overall, as well as obviously what I did speak to, which was business transformation. I also think you'll see us continue to improve our understanding of our customers and customer engagement. We hired a gentleman here this quarter, Bill Goetz, who's going to start up our marketing department with a lot of focus initially on the customer side of things. So there's several things we're working on there for the medium term, and we'll be able to explore those a little bit more with you here later in the year.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And as a follow-up to that, to what degree are you still doing reviews with your customers? And is that -- are you still getting a top line benefit like -- it probably is not what you were getting, but some kind of benefit from that process?", "William J. DeLaney", "We definitely are. I\u2019d say that's an area where we're very pleased. We continue to do them. I think we're doing them better in terms of the planning, the targeting of the actual review itself. A lot of these people have been through this now several times so you need to raise the quality of the review each time, as well as the follow-up. So we definitely get better retention, which is the main goal here, and ultimately penetration with the folks that we do review. And those tend to be our larger accounts and/or accounts with high potential. So that's definitely a positive for us right now.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. Then one final thing. First wave, remind us, that's going to be how many operating companies per week or per month?", "William J. DeLaney", "Per week?", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Again, well, I guess it's per month, right?", "William J. DeLaney", "It's per cycle. I'll let Chris kind of jump in there, John.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "We haven't actually talked about how many, and to be honest, John, that's something that we're still working through. But ultimately, we'd like to be able to get to more than a handful per wave. I would guess -- I would say that the first one is probably a bit smaller than that, but it's going to be enough to prove the next set of things we need to prove, which is, we can roll out multiple companies at the same time.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Greg Badishkanian, Citigroup.", "Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Two quick questions. First is just when you talked about taking some share and being aggressive, how much of that is due to price versus maybe having your reps out there just maybe calling on customers more? And is there -- have there been any reactions in the marketplace from your competitors?", "William J. DeLaney", "Okay, Greg, I'll start with that. So I think it's more of just an attitude or mentality. We -- if you go back and look at the numbers, as I'm sure you have, we have seen kind of a plateau-ing out in terms of real growth over the last 2 to 3 quarters at pretty low level. And we just -- we've mentioned here for the better part of a year or 2 that the pricing environment is pretty acute. And our whole business model is predicated on case growth and in terms of driving productivity, driving -- strengthening relationships with customers and that type of thing. So I think it's more of an internal mentality across our geography that we were just going to get more aggressive. And when people are coming after our business in aggressive ways, we, I think, have fought back a little bit harder than maybe in the past and maybe in ways that we don't really like in the short term. But the bottom line right now for us is I would have liked to have seen a better bottom line this quarter, but it's better for us to get the cases and, over time, work on improving our productivity than to continue to accept the kind of real growth that we were looking at in a market that's -- it looks like it's growing a little bit right now, but it's still going to be, we think, somewhat uneven. So we're just trying to be more aggressive out there in a smart way. There are certainly things that we need to improve upon, but we just felt that we needed to kind of take it to the market a little bit here.", "Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. Is that more in the street or more on kind of multichain or multiunit chains?", "William J. DeLaney", "It plays out different. I mean, in the street, you have 8,000 sales people. And on the big CMU accounts, you tend to be working one-off with the larger customers. But I would say it's both. I mean, what I'm really trying to say here is, we're trying to be highly responsive to our customers. This inflation environment doesn't appear to be going away anytime soon. That's very difficult for the customers. From the data that we see, it would appear that the inflation at the operator level that they're absorbing or passing along to their customers is 2% to 3%. You see our numbers around 6%. So that's something that we have to work through with the customer level. But to answer your question, it's on both fronts.", "Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And what do see your customers as doing to absorb some of the higher costs that they have besides trying to push back on you? Are they menu or are they -- what are they doing to be more creative?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, I think all the things that they've been doing, I mean, certainly, the menu analysis and trying to work with us and work within their own shops in terms of how to make the menu more attractive, more profitable. They're trying to find ways to -- there's a lot of different vehicles out there to increase traffic in their restaurant, manage their labor staff more effectively, all the things that you would expect a good business person to do in that type of operation.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Meredith Adler, Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess I'd like to just continue a little bit on this theme. I have heard that maybe some of the very largest of your competitors were not feeling quite as much pressure as you are. Do you have any sense if that's true? And do you have any sense about your positioning that might make things a bit more competitive for you right now?", "William J. DeLaney", "Meredith, what was the second part of the question?", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "If it's true, what is it about your business, the way you're positioned that may make you have to be more competitive right now?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, I don't know that it is true. It's hard for me to comment on what we may have heard from other sources, given that they're all private sources. So I can't really comment on how they're doing. I can tell you that this market, if it's growing at all, it's growing very little, and we just put up 2.8% to 3.6% growth, depending on how you look at acquisitions. So like I said, I mean, this quarter, we're not pleased with the bottom line, but we feel we're doing what's right for Sysco and our customers and our shareholders. And we're in this thing for the long term, so we've got a lot of different competitors out there with different time horizons, and I really don't know what they're feeling or seeing.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And on some of the smaller competitors, we thought they would get hurt during '09 because business was really weak, but we had deflation so it probably benefited on the working capital side. Do you think that they're under more pressure now because working capital is going up significantly? And are they having trouble getting financing?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Meredith, this is Chris. I'll try to take that one. Again, it\u2019s hard to make generalizations across the pool of some multiple thousands of smaller competitors. But as sales go back up, re-inflates as we like to say, if they want to participate in that growth, if they want to sell more boxes, they're going to have to find the financing for the working capital somewhere. I don't know if they have access to that capital or not, to be honest with you. They may not be participating in the growth. I mean, one thing you kind of have to look at, if Technomic is saying that the market grew last year, I think, basically 0.1% or flat, and we know we grew our cases and you're at least implying that others may have grown their cases, some of the big guys that kind of lead you to believe that somebody out there is shrinking, we just don't have visibility as to who it might be.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess I'm just trying to understand better. It is an extremely competitive environment. And do you have a sense where that competition particularly might be coming from? Or is it just very competitive in every market from lots of different competitors?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, I think it's a continuation of the theme that Bill and I have talked about here for several quarters. You've got a very, very high inflation coupled with stagnant growth. And when you get those 2 things together, it is just highly competitive. Everybody is used to growing, wants to continue to grow, and they've got to fight out there on the street to find that growth when it's not coming organically.", "William J. DeLaney", "And to compound that, Meredith, I know you know this, your customers are dealing with the same issues as are your suppliers. So that's what we mean when we talk about the pricing being acute and all that type of thing. It's acute at every level of the chain here.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And how long do you think it really takes to kind of get expenses and productivity in line with the gross profit dollar growth?", "William J. DeLaney", "Like I alluded to, I think you'll see us improve there. I think it will be gradual. This quarter, a little cautious in this quarter. Just from a standpoint, we had a pretty good bounce back quarter last year in the third quarter, and it's just hard to predict, like I was saying earlier, because March drives us so much. But I think as the rest of the year plays out, you'll see improvement there.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Karen Short, BMO Capital.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I guess it sounds like maybe you were a little surprised by what it cost you to drive the improved volume or case volume growth. So I guess I'm wondering, would you say you reacted more to an acute pricing environment in the quarter? Or did you lead the more competitive environment?", "William J. DeLaney", "We probably have reacted in some particular instances, Karen. And as I've mentioned earlier, I think internally, we just got a little bit more connected and coordinated on the fact that -- I don't know if you'd call it leading, but we're just -- we're not going to sit back in a flat environment and just hope that we get some case growth. You\u2019re going to have margin pressure whether we grow 0% or whether we grow 2% or 3%. And the part that we know for sure in our model is that when we grow cases and there's a good balance of that growth between street and contract, over time, we'll be able to make money. And that may be not as much on the delta as what we've seen in the past, but it's certainly better for us than accepting flattish type growth. So I wouldn't say we were surprised. Frustrated might be a little better word in terms of that we weren't able to take more of it to the bottom line. But we're being very, I think, appropriately aggressive out there. And obviously, over time, the investment that we're making needs to turn off -- turn into some positive margin -- operating margin enhancement. And I think it will. I just think it's going to take a little longer than maybe what we've seen in the past.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then any color on how much the timing of the holidays this year maybe helped your top line? I realized you'd probably give it back in the next quarter but...", "William J. DeLaney", "I don't think I can quantify that, but certainly, the calendar played to our favor this time, and I think it was more that than anything. I mean, basically, what we saw in terms of the retail, we think we saw in our business. December was a better month for us, meaningfully better than what we saw certainly in October and the first part of November. So I don't know about the numbers, but I can tell you, it was much stronger the last 5 or 6 weeks.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then just kind of looking forward, I don't know if you have any update on what you think the inflationary environment is going to be looking like. Obviously, there was a slight improvement this quarter.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. It's really hard to predict and a lot of different views on that. I don't see any views out there that say it's going to subside significantly the next 3 to 6 months. Hopefully, it will come back a little bit, but you've seen it go from, what, 4% to 5% to 7% back to 6%. So a lot of commodity pressure, a lot of pressure in the meat area. I'll let Chris speak to some of the other categories in terms of what it means to our business. But we're not really looking for a whole lot of relief here over the next couple of quarters.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, that's right. I mean, I keep saying we may have a crystal ball, but we don't know how to read it. It's -- it eased off. I'd like to say it was easing off throughout the quarter. That would not be factually correct though. It didn't ease off throughout the quarter. So it's hard to say where it's going to go. And then I think one of the things we've talked about in the past, not so much recently, is it used to be just a few categories. Now it's pretty broad-based. It continues to be fairly broad-based. Bill mentioned meat. That's been a category that's been under inflationary pressure for a while. And if you just look at supply and demand, it looks like it's going to continue to be under pressure for a while. Other categories may have the opportunity to ease off faster. Should we get some help in the commodities market, we'll just have to look at that. My best guess is we'll get back to a place where we have some categories that are highly inflationary and others that are more normal. And so the overall rate may be high, but it will only be across certain categories. That would certainly be better than the situation we're in today. But, again, that's crystal ball type stuff, and I can't tell you how long it takes to get there or even if we're going to get there.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, great. And then just last question. Any initial comments on how the second opco is doing on the new system?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. I thought we made some comments on that. I'll try again here, Karen. Look, we just went live there last weekend. So we're into early part of week 2, and it went well. I mean, it went well from an operational standpoint, and some of those things I alluded to in my comments in terms of where we had some struggles. Certainly, on the order entry and on the reports, we're off to a much better start there. And like I said, we saw those improvements already in Arkansas back in November. Now as you can appreciate in the cycle of our business, it takes 2, 3, 4 weeks to go through an inventory turn and all that type of thing to get a full handle on how some of the demand planning and the ordering and reordering systems and all of that will work. And so we'll be watching that real close here over the next 2 to 4 weeks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ajay Jain, Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I'm trying to reconcile the sequential improvement in volumes with your gross margin performance. So just based on the magnitude of the volume growth in the quarter, can you comment on whether there was any greater emphasis on price investments that might explain some of the variability in the top line and your gross margin performance?", "William J. DeLaney", "Ajay, it's a great question. I understand it from your perspective. It's just not exactly how we run the business here or how we\u2019d think about it. What I'm trying to articulate to you is, we did -- we had our presidents in for our regular fall council here in the middle of November, and we talk a lot about the business. And I think coming out of that meeting, we probably did take a little bit more of a cohesive approach to being more aggressive in terms of protecting our business, supporting the customer base and going after new business opportunities. So it wasn't like, okay, we're going to invest x in price to get to that, but we saw some pressure on margins as we did that. But to be honest with you, I can't tell you if the margin pressure really exacerbated that much the second half of the quarter. So I think my point is the pricing pressure is there. We're going to go out and get cases while it's there and learn how to manage it as best we can. And at the same time, there's a learning here that's been with us for some time. And certainly, our strategy, which I feel very good about, is addressing it, which is in the world that we're in and that we're going to be in for the foreseeable future, we need to continue to work on our cost structure. And it goes well beyond cutting and slashing. I mean, it's just a fundamental, a more cohesive approach to productivity opportunities in all parts of the business: operations, selling and admin. And you see us, over the medium term, beginning to address some of that with the business transformation work. In the shorter term, when you have 70 Broadline operating companies and 8,000 sales people on the street and 47,000 employees, there's always opportunities to improve productivity in a business. And those are the things that we're working on today. And clearly, there's opportunities for us to assess where we are in our pricing and tweak that as well.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And I think you confirmed, just based on the general operating environment and the read-through for your case volume trends, it looked like you did see some pickup in number [ph] and you're seeing some similar improvement in volume trends in the current quarter. It doesn't sound like things have tapered off -- correct me if I'm wrong -- things have tapered off over the last month or so. But can we infer from that, that your volumes or case volumes are still in the 2% to 3% range through the first 4 weeks of the quarter?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think what I said, Ajay, was that the trends that we saw in the latter part last quarter are continuing. I just want to be a little cautious here is that you've followed us for a long time. January, even February, are not that relevant in terms of this quarter. The month of March is kind of the month where you have the -- you still have the seasonal business in the South, but people start getting out again in the North. So yes, so far, we've seen continuation in the trends, but March is going to drive this quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, I think that the real key for us in the second half of the year is improving in the areas that have been questioned on and that we've addressed this morning. But we need to see a continuation of those trends. And if we do, I think we're well positioned.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "And if I could, I also wanted to ask a question about the facility in Indiana. I know that the timing has gotten pushed out a few different times over the last few years, and each time, it seems like the main reason cited for the delay is just the lack of industry growth. So I just wanted to confirm if the business decision to build out the third RDC is purely a timing issue from your standpoint. Or is there any kind of a scenario where you might feel that the capital investment just simply isn't warranted?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Well, I mean, Ajay, as you might imagine, those are all coupled together. When we build facilities, we expect to get a return. And when we first looked at that facility, just like the other 2, a lot of the return came from what we call the avoidance of capital, which is, as cases grow, we won't have to build out facilities around that new facility because that facility will take up much of the volume. So it helped with the return. So when you get into a low case environment, you're not seeing the same return on the facility. So we said, you know what, we need to push this thing off a little while and keep looking at it. We continue to look at it. Case growth here is certainly helping the case for that facility, but it's also causing us to be a lot smarter about what other benefits can we derive from that facility, how can we work with suppliers better in terms of inbound transportation, et cetera, to get more return out of that facility if we don't think we're going to get the return the same way as we did in number 1 and number 2. So it's really all of the above. It's certainly not something we've taken off the table. We just continue to evaluate it. And we said we'd look at it again in the spring, and that's our plan.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And one final question, if I could. Just based on your update for the ERP guidance of, I think, the new range is $2.30 to $2.50, how much of that is, if you can comment, Chris, is depreciation?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I can't really comment specifically on the depreciation number. What we have said is that if everything continues to go well with Oklahoma as we read the assessment, if we're prepared to roll out the first multiple wave, we would expect our depreciation to start somewhere in the latter part of the third quarter. And that is factored into the updated expense guidance that we've given you. We've not broken out how much it is at this point.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ed Kelly, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I'm just trying to get a sense for what real underlying market growth is doing here and what the cadence is for Q2 versus Q1. If you had not been, call it, a bit more aggressive in terms of growing volume, would your case volume growth have been similar to Q1? Would it have been slightly better? How should we be thinking about that?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, it's another one of those really good questions. It's hard to tell. I think what you should be thinking is, for the calendar year, the early estimate is that the market was flat. I think we said up 0.1%. I think at the same time, it was probably better than that in the December quarter for the reasons that we alluded to and certainly what you've seen in other businesses. So I think you probably would have seen better growth in the second quarter -- our second quarter than the first, even if we hadn't maybe gotten a little bit more aggressive in terms of our approach and mindset, but I don't think you would have seen what we put up. So that's the best I can conjecture on that, Ed.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And I'm trying to see if I'm reading you guys correctly here, but you sounded a little frustrated about the flow-through on the bottom line of the volume growth. But it doesn't sound to me like you really plan on changing how you go after volumes. So if you're going to improve that flow-through, was it really all about the operating expense line and how you get that done?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. Look, I used the word frustrated. Maybe, I don't know, depending on the day, that could be a little strong or it may not be. But the bigger point here, I think, from our standpoint is, when you look at our business model, it's predicated on growth, whether you're talking about building RDCs, whether you're talking about growing the earnings and that type of thing. And we know when we grow boxes that over some period of time, generally, we can leverage that into earnings growth. And that's what the goal is. So, yes, we acknowledge here that the number on the bottom line didn't come in where we expected it to for the quarter. So that's disappointing on one level, but I'm not disappointed in the sales. I mean, we feel good about how we're going after the business. I feel very good about our people and the effort that we're seeing there. I feel very good about the cash flow of the company. I mean, we put in this IRS thing -- after this year, that's behind us. I think you'll see our working capital management improve somewhat over time. And I feel good about the strategy. So overall, I feel good. The frustration is -- look, we're competitive people. We know that we have shareholders that are looking for certain numbers, and we just came in a little bit short of what we expected to come in at. But I'm not frustrated in terms of the business or the people.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then related to the business transformation costs, I know you're obviously not prepared to give numbers beyond what you've given this year. But do you think that the peak year in spending on business transformation costs will be fiscal '13? Or will it be the current year?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "When we had originally put up numbers for -- I'm going to try to answer your question not by looking forward but by reminding you of what we said before. When we first put up numbers, we showed the peak year being, I think, either fiscal '12 or fiscal '13. Since then, we\u2019ve talked about the delay that we've experienced. And so I think you can make a reasonable assumption that the peak year got pushed out. So my best guess, and I don't have numbers to share with you yet, but we do believe we'll have quite a bit to talk about in May. My best guess is peak year is going to be fiscal '13.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And just last question for you. Can you help us with how much you've capitalized to date? And then as you think about that line item beginning to amortize, over what time period should we be doing that on average?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes. So we're going to issue our Q tomorrow, and I think you'll be able to -- with that number and previous numbers, you'll be able to come up with the total capitalized number. I don't have it in front of me or off the top of my head, Ed, but you'll be able to see what it is. And then in terms of the timeframe, some of the stuff that we're capitalizing is at 7 years, some is at 5, some is at 3. Ball-parking it, not knowing the number off the top of my head, you can probably take an average around 5 years, and you will be -- plus or minus a year, you're going to be accurate.", "Operator", "We'll proceed next to Andrew Wolf, BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Bill, I know it's -- I don't blame you for being a little cautious on sales. But given the macro backdrop got a little better and your sort of -- your internal numbers got a little better in sync, and I know you're going out and getting share, too. But you also characterized, I guess, your outlook is -- you still think the market is going to be choppy. What would -- what might make you turn to a little more -- saying something like cautiously optimistic? Would it be a good March or -- for Sysco and the market? Or are you just -- that's your outlook? You just think it's going to be choppy? And if that's the case, could you explain why?", "William J. DeLaney", "I let Chris use the word choppy this time. I didn't say choppy. So I'm trying to be optimistic here, Andy. So, yes, I think a couple of good quarters in a row would be all I need, to be honest with you. And so I think we had a nice finish to the last quarter. How much of that was driven by holidays is to be determined. I just think, if you take a step back and just look at the economy in general and the mindset of the consumer, every piece of data that you're seeing right now on the consumer side is increasingly positive. So if that can continue and if that translates into people going out to eat a little bit more, as I said in my prepared remarks, then that's a good thing. So it's just -- it would be nice to see a trend over 2 or 3 quarters where you see that. And then I think that -- then that would really validate the approach that we've taken, which is to get more aggressive in the marketplace and to be well positioned when the volume picks up, then we can leverage a lot of our scale at that point in time. So I feel like we're doing the right things. It would be nice if we saw the results a little faster. We haven't. I think we will see them gradually. And, yes, I think cautiously optimistic is where we're at, but all that really means is, we need to see a couple -- maybe 3 good quarters together. And it really comes down to what's between the years of the consumer and are they to a point now where they're going to start going out to eat a little bit more. We're seeing a little bit of that, more at the quick service side. But what we've consistently seen over the last few months is that the tickets, the size of the purchases when people go out to eat, that is increasing. So we're seeing signs, and we just need to see them, I think, for a little bit longer.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Andy, I'll jump in since I'm the one that used the word choppy. The economist in me just continues to remind myself that we're comparing these latest quarters to a historically bad point in time. And by any measure, the economic -- the macroeconomic [indiscernible] still say that this economy is very fragile. So while we're -- Bill's words, I'll echo, while we're feeling a little bit better, you do have to sometimes pull back and remind ourselves that this economy overall is still very fragile. If we get some rhythm to it, the consumer confidence picks up, the jobs data is certainly helping here, that stuff starts to build momentum, you'll hear us starting to be a lot more confident about it. But we're not very far from the trough that we were in.", "William J. DeLaney", "I mean, the one thing -- I know you know this, Andy. But, I mean, the one thing we have to remind ourselves and we've been in this period here for an extended time now is going out to eat is still a relatively low-cost form of entertainment, and I've been saying that off and on for 25 years here at Sysco. And we certainly have had to deal with a new environment the last 3 years, but once that mindset turns, we think that, that will be helpful to our business. We just haven't really seen it turn in the business as much as we'd like to see yet.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Good. That helped me. A couple of housekeeping questions. Did you have a similar bonus increase accrual in Q1 that you called out this quarter?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, it's a little bit of a mismatch. Last year, in the second quarter, based upon our full year forecast and the bonus plan and targets we had in place at that time, we reversed the bonuses basically back to 0. That's just what the forecast was telling us. We were not going to hit the grid. We had a good third quarter, as Bill alluded to earlier though, and that put us back in contention. This year is a slightly different bonus plan. There are different targets and objectives because you change those year by year, depending on your plan. And we did not reverse -- we do not take our bonus accrual down as low as last year, hence you have a lapping effect of $18 million.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "And lastly, actually do have a follow-up on gross margin, which I thought was exhausted. But -- and you might have mentioned this, but was there a mix aspect to it, too? Are you growing a chain type or non-street type of business that might be lower margin at a greater rate? And is that just part of what is going on with the gross margin? Or was it mostly on the price side?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, we really -- I mean, we've done the same analysis on gross margin that we've done every quarter to try to ferret out is it mixed, is it this, is it that, and really nothing. The thing that stands out most is the category we've been calling inflation, which is just in the high inflationary product categories. That's where we're seeing the most margin. That accounts for the vast majority of the 75 basis points.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I think the only other thing I would add to that is, as you read our material and as we speak here today, we're talking a lot more in terms of deltas on dollars, piece growth, sales dollars, in particular, gross profit dollars, expense dollars, that type of thing. Look, we have concerns about the margin as you can expect. But the percentages are not as relevant. When you've been through a period -- extended period here now of several quarters of inflation, whether you're looking at expense percentages or gross profit percentages, I don't know that, that's as meaningful a way of looking at it as it might have been historically. But clearly, what is meaningful is the dollars that we're taking to the bottom line. So that's how we're evolving here in terms of how we look at the business internally, which is our gross profit dollar growth versus our expense growth.", "Operator", "And we'll have our last question today from Shaurja Ray, JPMorgan.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm on for John -- I'm John Ivankoe. Just a quick housekeeping one first. Did you quantify how much the weather and the calendar shifts were to the sales growth for the quarter?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, we did not.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Could you? Or is that...", "William J. DeLaney", "I don't think it was a big deal, to be honest with you.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I wouldn't try to be short with you. We didn't quantify them because, frankly, they weren't a big deal. They weren't enough to call out.", "William J. DeLaney", "We had some bad weather last year, I think, in the North, but we don't -- I don't really count that because bad weather in the North in December is not a big deal.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes. It's kind of something you expect year-after-year and you never know what day it's going to hit.", "William J. DeLaney", "I think the one thing that did help, but we didn't quantify it, was the way the calendar fell with Christmas and New Year's Day being on a Sunday. That did, I think, allow people to get out more. But I think we benefited more and our industry benefited more from just what you saw in retail and everything else, which is business just seemed to pick up throughout the holiday season. But even with that, I feel like we were able to grow our business better than others.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just in terms of, I think, longer term, you've talked to maybe 0.5 point or 1 point of sales growth coming from acquisitions. Could you just talk a little bit about how you guys see the acquisition pipeline going forward, if you still have kind of confidence in your ability to roll in maybe some smaller companies?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, I mean, that continues to be our goal and our plan, 0.5 point to 1 point. We've got a very robust pipeline. We're trying, as we've said in prior calls, to go back to kind of the way we used to do things in the past, which is just build relationships with the families that are out there. And when it comes time for them to exit the business for whatever reason, we're a phone call away, and hopefully we can put together a transaction. So we have a pipeline of folks that are thinking about exiting the business either now or sometime in the near future, and we try to turn that pipeline into actual transactions. We've done a number of deals this year. They\u2019re usually pretty small. We don't announce every one of them because of their size. But in aggregate, we hope they add up to 0.5% to 1% every year.", "Operator", "That concludes today's Sysco Corp. Conference Call.

", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.5 billion for the third quarter, a 7.6% increase. Case volume grew 3% including acquisitions, and we believe we continue to gain market share in the industry, which has shown little to no real growth for a number of quarters. ", "Net earnings for the quarter were $260 million and reported EPS was $0.44. Adjusted EPS was $0.49 and excludes several items including gross business transformation costs. On this basis, adjusted EPS grew 2% for the quarter. We believe this adjusted amount is more representative of the performance of our underlying business. The modest improvement in market conditions we experienced in the latter portion of the second quarter continued through the third quarter, due in part to an unseasonably mild winter in much of the northern part of the geography we serve. Our volume growth for the quarter was solid across nearly all of our business segments as we improved our customer retention, increased our overall account penetration and attracted many new customers to Sysco. ", "Our cost control performance at the operating company level was very encouraging during the quarter as well. Excluding the impact of fuel prices and prior year multi-employer pension plan charges, we reduced our cost per cases shipped. Conversely, gross margins continue to be a challenge. While 5.5% inflation and some difficult prior year comparisons contributed to the margin erosion we experienced during the quarter, we must execute more effectively in that area of our business. This area is always one of keen focus, and we have several initiatives in various stages of development that are designed to mitigate this pressure and still permit us to be highly responsive to our customers. ", "Turning to an update on our multiyear business transformation initiative and as we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we implemented a new technology platform at our second pilot facility back in Oklahoma back in January. While we saw significant improvement in the system's performance compared to our early experience in our first pilot in Arkansas, we did identify certain processes that require additional assessment and enhancement. We are addressing those opportunities now and are targeting a third rollout early in fiscal 2013. Successfully implementing this technology platform is a critical component to our transformation of Sysco. ", "Effectively driving our transformational change in a company such as Sysco, which has enjoyed a great deal of success over the past 40 years, can be challenging at times. However, in our case, we absolutely need to embrace such change if we are to continue to perform at a high level in a world that is much different than just a few years ago. Notwithstanding the predictable bumps that come with this type of journey, we remain highly focused on positioning Sysco to be a top-performing company for years to come. ", "In that regard, we recently announced that Manny Fernandez has agreed to expand his role and become Sysco's Executive Chairman of the Board. Manny is an outstanding business leader with a deep technology background. His experience and capabilities will enhance the execution and expedite the implementation of our business transformation work. I've worked closely with Manny for the past 3 years and look forward to his input and support as we build an even more customer-centric and operationally excellent Sysco. ", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $10.5 billion or an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year, driven mainly by food cost inflation, which we estimated to be 5.5% for the period. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.7% and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.2%. ", "Case volume for the quarter increased 2.9% year-over-year including acquisitions and 2.3% excluding acquisitions. We completed several acquisitions during the quarter, including European Imports, which we announced in late February and enhances our ability to address the specialty foods market. So far this year, we've completed 8 acquisitions representing roughly $260 million in annualized sales. We are on track to achieve our goal of increasing sales by 0.5% to 1% through acquisitions. We have a number of additional acquisitions at various stages of completion in our pipeline that we hope to close in the coming quarters. ", "Gross profit increased 2.1% during the quarter. Gross margin decreased 95 basis points year-over-year to 17.8%, pressured by an intensely competitive market and high levels of inflation. Operating expenses increased $28 million or 2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of a $29 million increase in salaries and related costs due to higher delivery and sales compensation and acquisitions. ", "Also impacting operating expenses were a $24 million increase in gross business transformation expenses and a $10 million increase in fuel expense. It's important to note that fuel surcharges offset this increase although they are reflected in gross profits. These operating expense items were partially offset by a $36 million charge in the prior year related to the withdrawal of one of our operating companies from a multi-employer pension plan or MEPP.", "Reported operating income increased $11 million or 2.7%, and net earnings for the third quarter were $260 million, an increase of $1 million or 0.4% compared to the prior year. ", "As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, excluding the impact of the business transformation project and the impact of COLI, which had a minimal positive impact this year, but had a significantly more positive impact in fiscal 2011 periods. In addition, last year's third quarter included the MEPP charge I just mentioned and a $10 million tax benefit. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses increased 2.6% and adjusted operating income increased 0.9%. Net earnings on this basis grew 2.8% to $290 million and EPS grew 2.1% to $0.49. ", "Turning to the impact of the business transformation project for a moment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, gross project expenses totaled $49 million, and we capitalized $39 million related to the project. In the prior year period, gross project expenses totaled $25 million, and we capitalized $42 million related to the project. ", "Now turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year were $908 million. In the prior year period, cash flow from operations was $666 million.", "As a reminder, we are paying the final $212 million in IRS tax settlement payments during this fiscal year. We have paid $159 million in cash in the first 39 weeks of the year, and we'll make the final payment of $53 million in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. In total, we will have paid the IRS $952 million over 12 quarters including this final payment. ", "Cash flow from operations improved by $242 million in the first 39 weeks compared to the prior year, due mainly to improved working capital management, the redemption of COLI policies, changes in accrued expenses and a lower pension expense. Working capital has improved year-to-date due mainly to smaller increases in accounts receivable and inventories this year compared to the prior year. This is due in part to improvements in DSOs, receivables and inventories and in part to changes in inflation trends. Last, as we discussed on the second quarter call, we redeemed some COLI policies, which benefited operating cash flows. This was an element of our previously discussed plan to reduce the market-driven COLI impact on our earnings. ", "Capital expenditures totaled $199 million for the third quarter and $633 million for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year. This year, we are constructing new facilities in Long Island, Boston and Central Texas, as well as a major expansion in Lincoln, Nebraska, compared to having only one such major project underway a year ago. Our new facility in Central Texas opened recently, which allows us to consolidate our facilities in Austin and San Antonio. With this move, we have the dual benefits of lower facility costs and a room for growth in this important market. ", "Before closing, there are a few guidance metrics for fiscal 2012 that I'd like to update. First, we now expect an increase in fuel expense of $35 million to $45 million this year, which is roughly $5 million higher than our previous guidance and is primarily driven by higher projected fuel prices. As a reminder, we implemented a fuel surcharge with a broader customer base late during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, which is intended to mitigate the increase in fuel expense. Fuel surcharges are recorded in sales and therefore benefit gross profit. We've wrapped the implementation of this surcharge, as I mentioned, late in the third quarter, so the year-over-year benefit from the surcharge will not be as apparent in changes in gross profit and gross margins going forward. ", "Second, we now expect gross business transformation expenses for the year to be approximately $175 million to $195 million, which is roughly $55 million lower than previous estimates. We had previously expected to begin amortizing project costs late in the third quarter, but this did not occur. We now expect amortization to begin in early fiscal 2013 with our next planned conversion. In addition, we expect the capitalized spend on our business transformation project this year to be $145 million to $165 million. This is roughly $20 million higher than our previous estimate, primarily because of the timing of our next conversion in early fiscal 2013. As a result, we will continue to capitalize more of the project's spend than originally planned.", "This increased CapEx spend on the project has impacted our overall expectations for CapEx for this year. As a result, we now expect total CapEx to be approximately $775 million to $800 million in fiscal 2012, which is back in line with the original guidance we gave in our 10-K. ", "In closing, while we are encouraged by improving industry trends, we are taking action in many areas to improve profitability in both the near-term and long-term, and believe Sysco's unique capabilities and commitment to ongoing investment in our business provide a solid foundation for future growth. ", "With that, operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask about the gross margin pressure. Is there a way that you might be able to tease out how much of that is from food inflation versus competitive pressures versus mix shift to lower-margin business? And kind of, I guess, as a second part of that is, if the current food cost environment holds, meaning the basket probably going to be down a bit next year based on the spot market, will GM rebound in fiscal '13?", "William J. DeLaney", "Mike, it's Bill. Obviously, I mean, I think you know us enough, well enough now to know that I probably can't answer with the kind of precision you'd love for me to answer it with. But let me try this. I would say to you that it's clearly coming from multiple places, all right? So you've got -- first and foremost, you've got our customers who are feeling a lot of pressure to continue to create traffic in their establishments, and that's where you see this difference in inflation, with inflation at the restaurant is, we believe, running 2% to 3% and ours has been in that 5% to 7% so far this year. So there's that kind of challenge that you work through there with your customer each and every day. There's certainly the typical type of competitive pressure that goes along with that. There's -- that's on the sell. Now there's also on the buy, where I think we have opportunities there to continue to find ways to work more effectively with our suppliers and that type of thing in terms of how we purchase the product. And then I think the third thing, and I think this is a little more clear this quarter, is there's us in terms of our mindset and our approach to pricing and trying to strike the right balance between being responsive to our customers and write an appropriate margin and that type of thing. So it comes from all 3. The reality, from where I sit, that makes this quarter a little different than the first half of the year is I just feel like we didn't do as good a job on the margin line in terms of what we can control and what we can influence in the short term. And I would just use an example and don't -- I'm not putting a pencil to this, but I think we're in an environment today with -- if you just listen to everything I just said and look at everything that you all look at, the environment today, I don't think, is an environment where anytime soon we're going to see margins turn around and necessary grow. I do think there's opportunity to mitigate that pressure. And if we had just had maybe 1/2 of the erosion that we saw on the margin line, maybe even just 2/3 of it, I think we -- the tone of my comments and the tone of the release would've been a little different, where our earnings would've -- they would've been good to maybe not great, but they would've been a very acceptable quarter from our perspective. So I think we're in a mode right now where our job is to continue to certainly be sensitive to our customers, work closer with our suppliers. But we've got to do a better job managing the margin. And I think from a messaging standpoint, when you're selling a box of food, and say our average box costs $30, $35, but some of the boxes in the area where we're seeing the most inflation, poultry, meat, those boxes can cost $45 and $55. It's very -- I don't think it's practical to expect that, that is going to be passed along in a short period of time on a proportionate basis. But I certainly think it's appropriate to expect us to do a better job managing the pricing on that. And that's obviously what we're working on.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And you mentioned -- you actually referenced in your opening remarks several initiatives to improve gross margin. Could you maybe, to the extent that you're able, give us an idea of what kind of things you're thinking about and if there are any 1 or 2 that we should have our eye on?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, I think it's going to be hard for you to have your eye on it, but I think the things that we have our eye on is there's certain things that we do in terms of how we approach pricing and where we might make exceptions and that type of thing and how we work with customers and suppliers. We just need to be more consistent throughout the organization. And so it's not 1 or 2 things. It's several things that go into how we price both -- with both our large contract customers and also with our street customers, how we buy product and how we manage that process internally. And what I'm really alluding to there is we have opportunity to execute better and, in particular, more consistently throughout the company and just make some better decisions there. So I can't give you a lot of granularity for obvious reasons, but I can tell you there's opportunity there.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then lastly, maybe if you could talk about -- a bit about the cadence of sales in the quarter. And I know it's not one -- I hate to slice things so finely. But the change in casual dining sales trajectory intra-quarter this particular quarter was pretty significant, where you had a decent January, February and then a much weaker March, April. So curious if you can give us any color as to what you saw for the quarter.", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, we don't typically comment on cadence of growth month-to-month. And obviously, we read a lot of what you all write and we have a sense for what you're saying, which is, I believe, the industry view is that things did slow down in terms of growth in March and April. This quarter, as we talked last quarter, it was just a back-ended-weighted quarter for us. March is always going to drive our numbers. So anytime you've got a bigger denominator, I think sometimes that will affect the growth rates as well. But certainly, the things that helped in January and February were the calendar. I believe we had -- I think the holiday helped us early off -- early on in the quarter. In the scheme of the overall numbers, that's not that big a deal. I think weather was probably the biggest thing. And we've kind of gotten to where we stopped whining about weather. But at least on this call, I'm at least acknowledging that it clearly helped the industry and it helped us from the standpoint that, I think, in some of your more metropolitan markets in the north, we saw and felt better volumes. Now I'll quickly add, and I'm not whining about it as I said, we were hurt in areas where you would expect winter to be beneficial. So the big ski areas in Colorado and Utah and Florida, we did not do as well in those areas. And so I'm not going to say it netted out, but it wasn't a totally positive thing from a weather standpoint. So not trying to dodge the question too much here, but we saw good growth in the first couple of months. It continued maybe at somewhat of lower rate. But I'd have to tell you the biggest thing I think we're beginning to see, and we don't comment on this on a month-by-month basis either, is I think the rate of inflation is subsiding and that's going to affect the top line as well. And hopefully over time, it will subside to a level where it's more in sync with what our customers can absorb.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "My first question is just on the operating expense leverage, which I think was somewhat commendable. But you clearly benefited from the cycling of last year's charge for multi-employer pension expense. And then just wanted to ask if there are any other factors that you can talk about behind the cost savings and whether or not any of the SG&A improvement has spillover effect into the fourth quarter.", "William J. DeLaney", "Ajay, it's Bill. Again, yes, I think we did some good things on the expense line. We tried to call out the things that I would characterize as nonrecurring or unusual. So the business transformation expense because of where we are in the timeline was a little less than what we originally thought and we did have the credit last year. The point I made was that at the operating company level, our cost per case was down slightly, which is a big deal. I mean, to manage your cost per case flat to down is something we're always trying to do, and at times, we do it better than other times. So I think if you go and look at our first half of the year, certainly, we had margin pressure. The first quarter, we didn't see the type of volume growth we would've liked to see in that. We did do better in that area in the second quarter. But we had opportunities just on execution in terms of the expense side in the business. And I just felt that our folks did a better job managing expenses throughout the company in all facets, SG&A and operations. So I think we just executed better on that line, and that's a line we're going to have to continue to address, both structurally as well as just day-to-day management, to mitigate the margin pressures that we can't totally overcome.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And can you confirm if there was a significant payroll or headcount-driven benefit this latest quarter?", "William J. DeLaney", "I'll let Chris take that one.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Got it. Really nothing to be called out, Ajay.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And as far as the change in the outlook for pension expense, Chris, can you confirm what's behind the updated guidance and if that's on the multi-employer side or presumably with your corporate-sponsored pension plan?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, Ajay. I may not be understanding your question. We actually didn't change our pension guidance. It's been the same all year. Was there a different question?", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "No. I'm sorry, I was just -- I was going off of your presentation materials. I thought the pension expense was indicated to be $25 million lower than fiscal '11.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes. And that's been the case. For the year, we said it'd be down about $28 million, roughly about $7 million per quarter, and that's been consistent during the year. That's one of those items you set in the beginning, and it's pretty much -- it's set for the year, so I was just calling out that on a year-over-year basis, it is lower and it's one of the reasons why the costs are lower.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay, sorry, my bad. Finally, I understand that you were able to eke out some gross profit dollar growth this last quarter. But assuming that you are going to market now with a more aggressive pricing structure, the gross margin impact seems to be increasing each quarter. So even as inflation seem to be moderating, do you have any color about the gross margin outlook for the current quarter in June? I mean, could the impact be more than the 100 basis points from Q3?", "William J. DeLaney", "The only color I have, Ajay, is we need to improve, as I said a couple of times now. So I certainly hope not. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that's an area of keen focus here. So we need to bring that number back. As I said to Michael, at this level of inflation, I don't know that it's realistic that we can totally reverse it, but we certainly need to lessen that variance.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Could you maybe talk about what the impact was in the quarter from the net impact of, I guess, the New Year's Day shift and the leap year on the volume front?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think it helped. I'm trying to be as descriptive as I can here. Leap year is always a good thing. You get an extra day. So I'm sure that helped, but -- and the holiday thing. But I think when you line that up with -- over a 13-week period and if you look at in those months, I don't think it's that big a deal, to be totally honest with you.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, Ed, this is Chris. We did take a look at that. And frankly, we didn't think it was enough to call out specifically. I think Bill's right. It helped a little, but it's really not material.", "William J. DeLaney", "I think the weather was probably a bigger help than anything.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And could we come back to the gross profit again? And I want to try to approach it a different way because there's a lot of questions on margin, and I'm not so sure how -- and I know margin's relevant. But maybe we could look at it a different way, right? If you think about gross profit dollar growth, which was a couple percent this quarter, your business is really all about driving more cases through the network, right? And gross profit dollar growth was less than real kind of volume growth, if you thought about it, for the first time in a while. So I wanted to get your thoughts on, going forward, is that how we should be thinking about this business? Can you grow gross profit dollars faster than volume? I'm just trying to figure out the best way to model this because up until now you've actually been doing a pretty good job there.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. I think I'm happy to come at it any way you want. We certainly look at it every way we can. I think it's a good callout in your point there and that's the unacceptable part of it. We can't grow gross profit dollars at a lower rate than what we grow cases. What I'm trying to acknowledge is what we've seen here the last few quarters and what I think we may see for a while is GP dollars may grow somewhat slower than the sales dollars grow, but that's, I think, where we're not pleased with the quarter. We should have -- we certainly sought to grow gross profit dollars at a higher rate. And I think if you looked at first half of the year, it was closer to mid-single digits, that type of thing. So that was our callout, and I think that's a very fair way of looking at it. But no, I would not -- we're certainly not planning the business around growing gross profit dollars at a lower rate than case growth. That's not acceptable.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Is that something that you can fix quickly, meaning like over the next quarter or so? Or does that take longer?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think it's just something that you fix each and every day in our business and you bring focus to it. And I think at the operator level, our operator level, we don't necessarily talk about it quite like that. We try to get people just more focused on their categories, on their customers and so on. But I take your point. I actually agree with it that when I look at our business, I look at everything clearly. But if there's kind of 3 lines that jump out, one is volume growth, two is gross profit dollar growth and three is cost per case. So those are the 3 things that we're very focused on. And I think again, in terms of how I approached my comments, we're pleased with the volume growth, we're pleased with the cost per case performance and we're not pleased with the gross profit dollar growth.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And, Bill, could you give us your assessment of sort of business transformation so far? I mean, we've got Manny coming in. It looks like there's been some delays in the rollout again. Just help us understand, I guess, what's happening and where the project is today versus kind of where you thought it would be.", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, we're going to we talk at length about that next week. But I'll kind of dive in here and try to give you some color. So essentially, we've had some delays and we've had another delay here after Oklahoma. We're not happy about that, but the reality is this is new ground for us. And it's better to deal with these issues now in terms of getting the system to perform at a level or at least close to the level that it's going to need to perform. So you state then [ph] to get too deep into this and then have to fix a lot of things after the fact. Now with that said, I think what you're seeing from the board is, we certainly can benefit from Manny's input and Manny's experience and the relationships he has in this area. And so he's going to work closer with our team and with me personally to make sure we're striking the right balance here in terms of driving this out at appropriate pace but also in a way that it delivers the benefits that we expect it to.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Ed, let me jump in there, too. We've talked about, today, business transformation primarily around the rollout of our new ERP system. And I think one of the messages you're going to hear from us next week pretty loudly is really helping the audience understand that business transformation is very, very broad and it includes a lot of stuff that's going on inside the organization, one stream of which is the rollout of this ERP system. And again, we're going to give you as much color as we can about all of the different things that we're working on. We're going to try to help you understand better which of those streams of initiatives have benefits that can be achieved in advance of an ERP and which of those are really tied to an ERP implementation, et cetera. So I'm saying all this only because when we think of business transformation around here, it's much more than just how quickly can we rollout the ERP system. As Bill said, it's a critical part of the future success of the organization, so we're frankly solidly supportive of it, and we've got to get it done and all those things. But at the same time, we're not waiting to do everything that we need to get accomplished for that ERP system to be fully rolled out. And again, we hope to give you a lot more color on that next week.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Do you think -- you had mentioned in the past that fiscal '13 would be the peak year for expense for the project. Is that still the case?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I think going back 1.5 years and 2.5 years ago at Investor Day, the numbers clearly showed that the peak year would be 2013. Now when I've been asked about that since that time, what I've said is we've not put out new guidance for cost and expenses yet. We will get into some of that next week, and we'll update you on where we think the peak is, et cetera. I think, again, the way to -- you didn't ask me; you asked Bill. But if you ask me how I look at this at least from a cost perspective is we're going to have costs for the ERP rollout and additional business transformation stuff for the next several years, obviously, until we get this thing all the way completed. We're also going to have benefits from business transformation that we're going to start to realize throughout this. I don't want to go back to talking about the net -- cost net of benefits. We hope to be able to show you those kind of independently. But I don't want to just fixate on the cost side of the equation. We really want to give you more color around what we believe the benefits are going to be as well.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. I think just to kind of wrap it from my end here, Ed, and we will talk obviously more next week, business transformation is just something we need to do. And that's what I was trying to talk about. We need to go to market. We need to make some changes in terms of how we go to market, and that's a big deal in terms of how we've been running the company here for the last several years. And we need to do that because the landscape in the world that we're competing in and servicing customer in is a lot different than it was even 3 to 5 years ago. The technology platform, as you hear us talk about that, is a very critical foundational part of the entire spectrum of business transformation. But as we get deeper into this thing and as we hit some bumps here and there, we also have the opportunity to adjust our thinking on what defines business transformation, what other things can we do to create some benefits along the way. And those are some of the things we'll talk about next week.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Ed, I feel like I dodged your question, so let me answer a little more directly in terms of the cost. While I can't tell you where the peak is yet, here's what I think we have said and will continue to say: 2013 will be more expensive than 2012. That should not be a surprise. As we start to depreciate this thing, we ramp up our shared service center more, 2013 will definitely be more expensive than 2012. What I don't have visibility on for you, as I sit here today, is whether '14 or '15 will be higher or lower or the same as 2013. Again, we hope to be able to talk more about that next week. We're still looking at all of that data as it flows in.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Bill, maybe you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment and what do you think your competitors are feeling. Obviously, you've had a gross margin hit this quarter, and case-wise, have gotten a little better. But what do you think is going on for the competitors out there? And are you seeing any further weakening that may cause some of them to exit the business?", "William J. DeLaney", "Great question, hard to answer because we don't obviously get a lot of visibility to their -- we don't get any visibility to their financial results, so a lot of what we get is somewhat anecdotal. My sense is that the larger players, the better operators of scale, are doing okay. I think this kind of market over time will be good for the people that have scale and who have the capital to invest in the business. So my sense is they're doing fine. I'm sure they're having to compete very hard on the margin line as well, but obviously, I don't have visibility to that. I think maybe we're beginning to see, and I'll let Chris speak to this, there's thousands of competitors out there. As we've talked before, I think perhaps some of the smaller ones are beginning to think even harder about what their future is in terms of the industry and that type of thing. I'm not saying it's a large-scale phenomena, but I think it is probably getting harder both for our smaller competitors as well as for some of the smaller operators in the space.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, I'll add to that. I mean, one of the things that we sense from the market, and again, it's more anecdotal than anything, is everyone is highly focused on cost right now. So that should tell you something about where the top line is with some, all of our competitors. It is easier if you've got some size and scale to get some cost structure improvement. I think the smaller players, while they may be great companies and they're highly competitive in their own markets, it is harder for them to get their cost structure down significantly, and it's becoming harder for them to -- I believe, harder for them to compete, and frankly, we're starting dialogues with more of them these days than we have been.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Just a question on the road map here on the business transformation. So I think the plan previously was you would do the second market and then do waves of openings. So now you're inserting one more third market test and then the waves of openings come. And is that moment where you hit the waves of openings, is that when you start depreciating at that point?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, actually -- and I don't know exactly what I said on our prior calls, so I'll just say it new and fresh, is we will start depreciating when we go to the next company. Now you're right. Originally we thought we would be going to a small wave of companies next. We're actually going to go to, we believe, one additional company, as Bill said, in the early part of the new fiscal year, probably a month or so later than we had originally intended. So that would trigger depreciation. And that's an accounting determination of when we're putting the machine into service. And so that is still the plan. And that's the only reason frankly the depreciation didn't start in the third and fourth quarter, is we weren't -- we had not rolled to that next conversion yet. Thereafter, we're not really commenting yet about what the conversion cycle or rate or run rate or road map was going to be at this point in time. We'll give you, again, more color on that next week. But it's not our goal to put out there a set number of companies for next year or a pace. It's more along the lines of here's the progress we hope to make in the next year, and it will almost certainly be a range. If we've learned anything about this, it's that the best-laid plans don't always come to fruition, and so we'll range it appropriately.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And are the cost savings more linked to the number of operating companies that are using it? Or is it there are other activities that might generate cost savings as well?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes. So let me go back to the comment I made earlier about business transformation, in general. Again, as we've gotten into this thing over 3 years now, there's quite a bit that we've been able to identify in terms of cost savings, other enhancements that are not directly tied to a new ERP system being rolled out into our company. As we've identified those and we've discovered how we can accelerate those, we're obviously going after those sooner rather than later and they're not tied to any number of companies being converted. There are obviously other benefits opportunities that are still tied to us having a new ERP system in all of our operating companies. That, of course -- or those, of course, would be weighted more towards the more companies you have, the more benefits you get. Those are things that primarily are tied to the types of business processes and functions that will be put into our shared service operation. So the more companies you roll out, the more of those functions we can consolidate into our shared service operation and begin to realize some of the benefits.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So, Bill, a couple of things. Where do you think you are with your analytics around pricing? And then getting back to the gross margin question, with respect to demand elasticity, right, and an ability to forecast or tell what the elasticity is per item in certain geographies, so where does that capability stand? And if it's not where it needs to be, what would you do to make that more robust?", "William J. DeLaney", "Great question, John. I would say to you that -- in terms of the way I'm interpreting your question, I'd say we have a lot of work to do in that area of pricing in terms of more sophisticated or scientific pricing. But we have done some work there and we'll continue to look at it. The balancing act here is again -- don't hold me to these percentages. But let's just say that roughly 1/2 of our customers have some form of contract and the other 1/2 don't. They work with a marketing associate and that type of thing. So what we're always trying to do is balance the value of having, say, a more scientific approach to pricing with the value of having that marketing associate in front of the customer, taking that order and really understanding what's important to that customer today in terms of their order, and frankly, down the road, over the next 1 to 3 months in terms of running their business. So our marketing associates typically and even our presidents probably typically don't think in terms of elasticity, but that's what they do. I mean, they're making a judgment call every time they take an order: what's the right balance in terms of maximizing that order, supporting the customer in terms of what they need and striking the right overall price, not necessarily per line item but for that order in general? And so that today and as you well know historically has been handled in a very decentralized way through our sales folks and through the operating companies on that large segment of our customer base. I believe there is opportunity to do more sophisticated work in that area, but it's work that's in its formative stage with us at best right now. And I think that will be one of our key -- that is one of our key initiatives that we've called out and that we'll talk a little bit about next week. But frankly, it will take some time to develop. So I guess my answer is there's opportunity there, but I don't necessarily see a scenario where you go all the way to one extreme and you want to be totally pulling levers from a centralized location on a group of customers that still are going to be somewhat -- their decisions are going to be driven, what's happening in that local marketplace, what's happening in their establishment. So I still think that local salesperson and local operating company visibility is going to be very important.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So to follow on then, the -- and I agree, you can't measure from Houston. But having said that, do the systems exist today to give the marketing associate more information on that? Do they have it -- can they access it? And then, is it more an issue of training so that they are more familiar with how the elasticities work?", "William J. DeLaney", "Again, I'm going to stay away from the word elasticity. They have more visibility. They have a lot more visibility today, John, than they did, say, 5 or 7 years ago to certain things in terms of cost movements and that kind of thing. They have more visibility today than they did to some other things 1 year or 2 ago. I'd say 2 things. One is our ability, to your point, to train effectively that will lend itself to execution. And then secondly, what else can we provide them in terms of not just maybe what's happening with our customers within what we see, but what else is happening in the marketplace? And that's a whole different level of analytics that is very difficult to get to, but may provide us an opportunity down the road. So they certainly have more information than they've had in the past. But your point is a valid one. There's training opportunities here and there's execution opportunities, and then there's a whole other body of work which is, what else can we provide both at the central location as well at the local location to make smarter decisions that are in the best interests of both our customers and ourselves? So we're making progress, John. I'm not trying to dodge here. We're making progress. But this would be -- this is a big opportunity for us over the next 3 to 5 years.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then when you think about tying that back into the macro then, if we're going to see disinflation here, which we probably should, that 5.5% should be a year from now from or quicker, what do you think the elasticity is that, that in itself creates demand, right? So we'll -- we lose a couple hundred basis points in inflation. We gain some percentage of that in unit demand. And I assume, would you agree that it's not one-for-one, right?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, it's not one-for-one. I'm not even sure that's a key variable anymore. I think if you and I were having this conversation 5 or 10 years ago, we'd be talking about that. I think what's more important is the mindset of the consumer and how our customers see that and their ability to absorb price increases and to get traffic to make themselves more profitable. So I think it's actually the psyche of the consumer is more important than that right now. But where the lowering of inflation, if it happens gradually, would be beneficial is it just creates less of a gap between what so far we've had to absorb and what we're able to pass along. Now look, I would also echo what I said earlier: gross profit is a function of a lot of things. You've got to move boxes. It's a function of how we price. It's a function of how we move prices within our system, transferred pricing, if you will. And it's how we buy. So there's other things we need to do on the buy as well. And that really comes down to reassessing how effective some of our strategic relationships are with our suppliers. And we're beginning to do that.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. And then lastly, right now, the plan for the third operating company is to be in test for roughly how long? And then when you start the rollout, what's the capacity within the organization to do this, meaning I don't know how you -- whether you're going to measure it by quarter or what. But what do you think capacity is to get companies rolled out?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Well, we're going to roll out, as we said, the third conversion in the early part of fiscal 2013. We don't really have any intention of having a set period of time to watch the system before we make additional determinations. We'll actually put in place a schedule that says, \"Unless we find something that is material, we'll keep going and we'll do more.\" We're not really, again, commenting about how many more of these things we'll do. We'll talk a little more about that next week. But I'll plant kind of a concept is that in the past, when we've talked about the rollout for the ERP system, we've -- frankly, we've put out there what we hoped to be able to accomplish, which ended up being a fairly aggressive rollout schedule. And we've put the numbers out there appropriate for that rollout schedule, and we're learning a lot in the process that tells us that it is aggressive or it was aggressive and we might want to be a little smarter about how we roll this thing out. The way we'd hope to be able to talk about it next week is, look, this is a process that is going to be continuing for a while. There's a pace that we need to do that's a relatively conservative and smart and prudent pace. But if we get legs underneath us, if we start seeing great responses from the first few rollouts, we'll be ready, willing and able to go faster. But that's not going to be the way we plan it. We're just going to be ready to do it if we start getting some great news out of the system. So again, I think we'll talk a little bit more about that next week. But right now, we're not talking about any number of companies per quarter or per year.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Karen Short with BMO Capital.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just a couple of questions on gross margin. And I want to kind of focus on Broadline versus SYGMA, and maybe I'll separate this out into sales and -- or case volume in Broadline and SYGMA and gross margin. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about each segment directionally, which is seeing slightly better than you might have expected case volume growth and which is seeing less gross margin erosion? Maybe just kind of talk directionally about each of those.", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, let me take the first part. I don't know that we can say a whole lot about the second part, Karen. But in terms of growth, I would say, and I alluded to this in my comments as well, we saw good growth in all the segments, I would say, with the exception of our FreshPoint. The produce markets last year were a lot more volatile, and so that created some challenges this year in terms of both top line growth as well as margin management in that area. So I'd say the Broadline, with the exceptions of some of the -- maybe the weather-sensitive areas where we had some -- perhaps some better performance in places that characteristically we wouldn't see in the winter, up north, and some weaker performance in some of the more vacation spots, I'd say generally, the case growth was good throughout. It was good in Canada. SYGMA had good case growth. The earnings pressure -- they did have earnings pressure more -- they've had more pressure on earnings this year than the last 2 years, where they've had really strong years. Meat companies we've integrated into the Broadline now, so I don't want to call out too much here. But I would say it's generally pretty good with the exception of the produce side of business.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "But would it be fair to say that SYGMA has gotten more competitive directionally than Broadline?", "William J. DeLaney", "No, I wouldn't say that. I mean, I think we've tried to be competitive on both. I think probably one thing I should say because sometimes I think it gets misunderstood, we've seen good growth and pretty comparable rates of growth both on the contract side of the business, including SYGMA, as well as the street side of the business. So I think -- sometimes I think people think all of our growth is coming from the contract side. But the reality is it's pretty balanced. It might have been slightly steeper on the contract side but not that much. Now we've invested in margin to get some of that, to be fair, but we're seeing good growth on both sides of that equation.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at gross margin, if you said this, I didn't catch it. Is there -- can you kind of give a directional split between the competitive environment and inflation on the gross margin pressure you saw this quarter, like 50-50?", "William J. DeLaney", "No, I tried there and I obviously didn't do very good. I'm almost looking at it in a different way. So I think in one bucket, you can put the customer and what they can absorb, you can put the competitor, you can put the supplier relationships and you can put, for lack of a better term, what's in between our ears in terms of what we think we can do. All right. So that's what the bucket is. It's impossible for me to tell you how much is one or the other. That's why you hear us talk about competitive pricing environment as opposed to competitive competitor environment. The other bucket, I think, is just the math of inflation, which is what I was trying to bring out, which is at this rate of inflation, I don't know -- percentages are not quite as relevant as they are when you have 2 to 3 points of inflation, whether you're looking at margin or whether you're looking at costs. Dollar growth -- at the gross profit line, dollar growth of that operating income line becomes very important. So the way I'm just trying to compartmentalize in my head is, what level of margin erosion could've still provided a quarter that would've met our expectations? And again, I'll let you do the math on that because I don't know what your expectations specifically were. But I would say if we had 1/2 of the erosion on a percentage basis, we would've probably been pretty pleased with the quarter.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then I just was curious on the CapEx. Your CapEx for the year comes up about $50 million to $75 million. I think you called out $20 million was business transformation. What was the remaining bucket?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Actually, the increase on the annual CapEx is really almost entirely made up of the increase on the ERP system. It's the comparison between the quarterly and the annual. But going back to the range of $775 million to $800 million from where we were last quarter is almost entirely made up of the ERP increase, the amount of additional capitalization there, which is $20 million year-over-year, I believe, but it's about $40 million quarter-to-quarter.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "We talked a lot about inflation and passing it along. But maybe you could talk about -- I think you said you got some business by being aggressive. Could you talk a little bit about sort of what you're doing to go after business? And are there particular customers or segments of the business that you're being particularly aggressive about?", "William J. DeLaney", "I'll start with that one, Meredith. I think what we've -- what I've tried to say is that we've been aggressive in growing our business in terms -- and I think in a market like this, we certainly should be. I don't know that any of the issues that we're talking about today, whether margin pressure or managing costs or business transformation, I don't think any of those would be a whole lot better if we didn't grow the cases. And I would argue that they'd be even more acute challenges. So the first place we start, and we've had to do a little more of this over the last year or so than in the past, is we're kind of defending our own turf a little bit more than we've had in the past. We have a lot of different people that come after our customers obviously. And we have a lot of customers. We have a lot of good business out there. So we certainly have, I think, dug in over the last several months and tried to work with our customers in every way we can in terms of drop size; in terms of delivery days; in terms of products; and ultimately, where necessary, in terms of price points to give ourselves every opportunity to retain business. And then our most profitable business, beyond what we retain, is the business that we grow within the account. And so as we see opportunities where we might have 23% share of wallet and we see opportunities to grow that business, we certainly -- and this is not something new. I think maybe the degree of it's a little greater than in the past. We go after that business hard and we find creative ways that make sense for the customer and us. And sometimes, that may result in price accommodation with the expectation that we'll get more business and larger drops and that, that should fall to the bottom line on the expense line. That's why traditionally I've always focused more on the sales line and the operating income line, and then tried to explain those deltas between the 2 lines above, gross profit and expenses. And of course, the third area is an area where we're always, I think, very proficient, which is going after new accounts. And our best reference for new business is current customers, and I think it's just -- that's just the environment in terms of what it takes to go after -- if we're going to after business we don't have, that's typically somebody else's gold account. So we're coming at it from all directions, but I would tell you they're all important. But I think if there's a little bit more emphasis than the other in the last 12, 15 months, it's been more on making sure that we don't lose business with the quality customers that we do have and we find acceptable ways to retain that when other people come after us.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then a question about the business transformation process. You folks did actually invest in a shared services facility in Houston, but obviously, I don't think it is being fully anywhere near fully utilized at this point. I was wondering whether there are dis-synergies caused by the delay in rolling out the ERP system.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes. I think absolutely correct, Meredith. I think we've talked about that on a previous call, that one of the reasons why these numbers, these expenses are high right now is that we've got significant costs out at our shared service center because you have to ramp up in anticipation of additional converted companies. And so you don't get to kind of scale, if you will, until you're pretty far down the road. Now we've tried to be sensible -- once we got more of an idea about the pace of conversions, et cetera, we tried to be sensible about not getting the ramp-up -- or getting too far ahead of the ramp-up curve. But even still, in the early days of these things, they cost more money than the benefits that they derive for you, and that's going to continue to be the case for a while.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And actually, I want to go back to Bill and sort of follow up with my first question to you. I guess, you made a comment, I think, last quarter about the most important thing was to drive case volumes. And if you were successful, the profits would come. And I don't know. I've been around a really long time, and my experience is that you may drive volume, but sometimes the profitability of an industry just goes down permanently after that kind of aggressive behavior. And of course, it sounds like everybody's being aggressive. Could you comment on whether this is a phase for the industry? Or have we set a new lower bar in terms of profitability?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think, as far as I'm going to go today, Meredith, is I think what we've acknowledged for quite some time now is that we expect the rate of growth in this industry to be modest at best, perhaps even flat. And that we believe that our abilities and capabilities and scale should translate into us being able to grow faster than the market. Clearly, as I've mentioned here even a couple of times today, we're in a different environment than where we were 3 or 5 years ago. So I think a lot of industries are going to be challenged with profitability. So let me try to connect the points. So I think you've quoted me pretty accurately. I do believe that we should be out growing cases and growing volume, not at the expense of profitability at all levels. But I guess, I'm confident in our people and in our systems that we will turn those sales and those incremental business into profits. Now in the short term, obviously, we're seeing some pressure there and there's some execution issues and that type of thing. The connection, I guess, would be that doesn't mean that we don't have to do some things differently. And we'll talk some more about that next week as well. But it connects to some of the things that Chris alluded to in terms of, what is business transformation? So certainly -- I don't think I can just say it's a phase. I think we have moved into a part of the time in terms of the business world, our industry is no exception, where the consumer expectations and our customers' expectations are more acute and more specific than they've ever been. And so price, product quality are always going to be important. So I think it's all of the above. We need to continue to grow our volume. We need to grow it the right way. We need to continue to take our cost structure down, both in terms of our day-to-day execution, as I mentioned earlier, but also looking at our structure overall in terms of operating costs, our product costs, how we work with suppliers and all that as well, so -- and we clearly need to manage our margins along the way, so it's not one or the other. But no, I don't think it's a phase. I mean, I think we're in a new normal, so to speak, and we need to do all of the above. My only point is to just cut and -- or to try to squeeze too much out on the margin line at this point in time, I'm not confident that, that takes us where we need to go as a company.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A session and our presentation for today.

DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales and net earnings for the fiscal year of $42.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Earnings per share was $1.90. Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per share for our underlying business was $2.13, representing a 4.4% increase year-over-year. Sales grew 7.8% for the year as case volume growth of 3% and product cost inflation of 5.5% contributed to the highest annual sales level in our history.", "Earnings growth was not as strong as pricing pressures resulted in only modest gross profit dollar gains. However, we did experience improved expense management in the fourth quarter and expect to continue that trend in the new fiscal year.", "Cash flow from operations approximated $1.4 billion, a significant improvement over our performance in the prior year. On the capital investment front, we recently completed construction and began shipping from 3 new and more efficient distribution facilities, a 420,000-square-foot facility outside of Boston, a second 420,000-square-foot facility located between Austin and San Antonio and a 240,000-square-foot facility on Long Island. All 3 of these operating companies are located in large markets that provide tremendous growth opportunities for Sysco.", "Looking forward, we remain totally committed to profitably growing our business in the $225 billion market that we serve today. While industry growth is expected to remain modest, we are highly focused on strengthening and expanding our customer relationships, as well as reducing the cost structure of our underlying business. To do so requires transformational change in all aspects of our business.", "Successfully deploying a new and enhanced technology platform is a foundational component of such change, and we continue to progress on that front. Specifically, we recently converted our East Texas operating company to our new ERP system in late July, our third location to go live. We are pursuing a market-based approach for our rollout schedule, which we believe will enhance the conversion process in 2 key ways: First, we have more -- we will more effectively leverage our market leadership team; and second, the close geographic proximity of the operating companies will permit us to utilize all of our resources in a more flexible and efficient manner. As a result, our next 5 planned conversions will be facilities in Texas and Louisiana, all of which are expected to occur this fiscal year.", "As conversions have occurred, we have become increasingly encouraged with the ramp-up in services provided and the quality of service at our Shared Business Services center, or SBS, here in Texas. SBS is staffed and effectively supporting our 3 converted companies with multiple centralized functions, including financial support, replenishment, national account pricing and a customer support call center.", "We have also begun to make progress on our key business transformation cost reduction initiatives. These initiatives focus on improving productivity in our operations, selling and administrative areas, as well as lowering product costs. For example, each of our Broadline operating companies has already taken action in a variety of areas and begun to implement processes designed to enhance productivity in delivery and warehouse operations.", "On the SG&A side, after careful and thoughtful analysis, we have elected to restructure our domestic nonunion retirement programs. Specifically, effective December 31, we will significantly enhance our 401(k) plan and freeze our nonunion-defined benefit pension plan. The enhanced 401(k) plan will provide benefits to our associates that are highly competitive in the marketplace in a manner that results in meaningful cost savings to Sysco over time. Chris will discuss the financial savings in a moment.", "On the product side, we are moving forward with developing our category management process, including preparing to pilot several food categories.", "Returning value to our shareholders remains a top priority for Sysco. We recognize that our dividend represents a significant component of Sysco's shareholder return, especially as we navigate through the transformational changes I noted earlier. Accordingly, we increased our dividend during this past year, the 42nd time since our founding in 1970. In total, we distributed $623 million in dividends to shareholders during fiscal 2012.", "Looking back on 2012, it was clearly a year of transition for Sysco. While fiscal 2013 will undoubtedly provide its share of challenges, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead to profitably grow our core business and expand beyond the core over time.", "In closing, I want to thank all of our associates for their efforts this past year in supporting our customers. Their contributions going forward are critical to fully realizing Sysco's vision to become our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, sales were $11 billion or an increase of 5.9% compared to the prior year, driven equally by case volume growth of 3.4% and food cost inflation of 3.3%. Excluding acquisition, case volume increased 3.3%.", "In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.6% and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.5%. During fiscal 2012, we completed 9 acquisitions, representing nearly $270 million in annualized sales and met our goal of increasing sales by 0.5% to 1% through acquisitions. Nearly 20% of our new case growth came from acquisitions in fiscal 2012. We have a number of additional acquisitions at various stages of completion in our pipeline and are targeting to increase sales in excess of 1% through acquisitions in fiscal 2013.", "Gross profit in the fourth quarter continued to be pressured by an intensely competitive market. Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased 2.9%, but gross margin decreased 54 basis points year-over-year to 18.2%. Fuel surcharges provided no benefits to year-over-year comparison as surcharges were comparable in both periods.", "Gross margins have historically increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, but we broke that trend in the fourth quarter of 2011. We are encouraged the gross margin increased 39 basis points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, which is more in line with historic trends.", "Operating expenses increased $103 million or 7.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to the prior year period. This increase included $23 million in certain charges that were mainly related to the withdrawal of one of our operating companies from a multi-employer pension plan or MEPP. Excluding these certain charges, operating expenses increased $80 million or 5.7%.", "Operating expenses were also impacted by a $38 million increase in gross business transformation expense and a $20 million increase in salaries and related costs. Operating income decreased $45 million or 8.1% driven by a decrease in gross margin, partially offset with gains in case volume. Excluding the certain items that I mentioned previously, operating income decreased 4%.", "Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $309 million, a decrease of $27 million or 8% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.53, a 7% decline compared to the prior year. Excluding certain items, diluted EPS was $0.55.", "As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes certain items but also excludes business transformation expenses and the impact of COLI. As a reminder, COLI had a minimal positive impact on our results in fiscal 2012 but had a significantly more positive impact in fiscal 2011.", "", "Adjusted operating expenses, which excludes these items and better reflects our underlying business performance, increased 3.3%; and adjusted operating income increased 2.2%. Net earnings on this basis grew 3.7% to $367 million and EPS grew 3.3% to $0.62.", "Turning to the year-over-year comparison. Sales increased 7.8% or $3.1 million, due mainly to inflation of 5.5% and case growth of 3%. Food cost inflation declined steadily throughout the year from 7.3% in the first quarter to 3.3% in the fourth quarter. Excluding acquisitions, case volume grew 2.5% for the year. In addition, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.7%, and changes in foreign exchange rates did not have a meaningful impact.", "Gross profit increased 3.8% during the year while gross margin decreased 69 basis points year-over-year to 18.1%. The decline in gross margin was due to high inflation combined with weak restaurant traffic, competitive pressures, segment mix and a more aggressive go-to-market strategy.", "Operating expenses increased $323 million or 5.9% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Operating expenses for both years were impacted by certain items primarily consisting of MEPP withdrawals. In fiscal 2012, these certain items were approximately $13 million lower compared to the prior year. Excluding these certain items, operating expenses increased 6.2%.", "Operating expenses also included $147 million increase in salaries and related costs due to increases in delivery and sales compensation, increased volume in acquisitions, a $91 million increase in gross business transformation expenses and a $40 million increase in fuel expense. These increases were partially offset by a $27 million decline in corporate-sponsored pension plan expense.", "Cost per case in our Broadline Companies was up $0.04 year-over-year. This was mainly due to increased delivery costs, including a $0.02 increase related to an increase in fuel price. Operating income declined $41 million or 2.1% for the fiscal year. Excluding certain items, operating income declined 2.7%.", "Net earnings for fiscal 2012 decreased $30 million or 2.6% compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2012 EPS was $1.90, a decline of 3.1%.

Cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2012 was $1.4 billion an approximately $300 million or 29% increase compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period. This improvement was due mainly to improved working capital management and lower tax payments during the year.", "Working capital has improved year-to-date due mainly to smaller increases in accounts receivable and inventories this year compared to the prior year. This is due to improvements in DSOs for receivables and inventory, partially offset by a decline in accounts payable DSOs.", "Of note, we paid our final IRS tax settlement payment during the fourth quarter for a total of $212 million during this fiscal year and $952 million over the last 3 years. The completion of these settlement payments will have a significant positive impact on our cash flows in future periods.", "Capital expenditures totaled $152 million for the fourth quarter and $785 million for the fiscal year.

The effective rate for the entire issuance was around 2%, a continual reminder of the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows.", "Before closing, there are few guidance metrics for fiscal 2013 that I'd like to provide. First, based upon current market conditions and external forecasts, we expect fuel expense to be relatively flat year-over-year; second, regarding business transformation. As we shared with you at our Investor Day, we expect gross business transformation expenses, net of direct benefits related to SBS, to be approximately $300 million to $350 million for the year, including the amortization of project costs.", "As Bill mentioned, we are now in the deployment phase of our new ERP system. And so this month, we began to amortize the capitalized costs related to the development of this system over a roughly 7-year period. The majority of work occurring going forward is expected to relate mostly to conversion and training, which is expensed for accounting purposes. As a result, you'll see a decline in the amount of capitalized spend on our Business Transformation Project going forward. This year, we expect to capitalize roughly $5 million to $20 million, which is $130 million to $140 million lower than our capital spend for fiscal 2012.", "As we outlined at our Investor Day, we expect that we'll achieve $550 million to $650 million in annualized benefits from business transformation by fiscal 2015, of which we expect to achieve roughly 25% in fiscal 2013. As Bill said earlier, we have begun to make progress on all of our key business transformation initiatives.", "Third, total CapEx for fiscal year 2013 is expected to be approximately $600 million to $650 million, which is substantially lower than the $785 million we spent in fiscal 2012.", "Lastly, I want to address pension expense for fiscal 2013. As we were developing our 2013 financial plan, we learned that we were facing more than $100 million in additional pension expense for next year, primarily driven by continuous declines in interest rates. This substantial increase would have been in addition to the significant increases in 2 of the last 3 years. We determined we needed to carefully review our retirement programs.", "As a result of our analysis, as Bill discussed earlier, we announced this morning that we made the decision to freeze our defined benefit pension plan effective December 31 and simultaneously enhance benefits to employees under our 401(k) or defined contribution plan. The net impact of these changes will result in the roughly $25 million in additional retirement expense in fiscal 2013. While still an increase, this represents a more than $80 million cost avoidance.", "It's important to note that the net impact of these changes in our retirement plans will not be even across the quarters during the year. Retirement plan expense in the second half of the year will be higher than the first half. Because these changes become effective at the midpoint of fiscal 2013, we estimate that our retirement plan expenses will be lower in 2014.", "In closing, while fiscal year 2012 was a year of transition, we continue to stay focused on our future. Fiscal 2013 will be another critical year for us as we work through the first round of ERP deployment and begin to realize benefits from several areas of our business transformation plan. Sysco has been a leader in the industry for over 40 years; and while the change we are undergoing is difficult and requires a substantial investment, it is important to the future success of this company. All of us here at Sysco are focused on transforming the company and believe that this will enable us to further strengthen our financial results over time and enhance our industry leadership position.", "With that, operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "It's actually Steve Forbes on for John today. Just a couple quick questions. The sequential improvement in gross margin this quarter, is that tied to getting more pricing through or a conscious effort to pull back on some promotional spending?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think, Steve, it's just some modest improvement on our part in terms of execution. As Chris pointed out in his comments, there's a seasonal flow that we tend to participate in as you go into the summer, and I think that helped as well. So I think we're executing somewhat better. I don't think there's anything dramatically different in terms of the promotional spending.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And now when it comes to the inflation and pricing for next year, how do you keep your marketing associates focused on gross profit dollar growth and/or case growth?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, the way our commission program works, the bulk of our marketing associates are paid on commission, and the biggest factor in that commission is gross profit dollars per delivery. So we continue to tweak that particular model as time goes on to do just what you're suggesting here, which is to keep us focused on growth and quality growth. But the bottom line is they're highly incentivized to service our customers well, but at the same time to strike the right balance between sales and gross profit dollars.", "Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly on case growth. Did you see any change from June to July in case volume growth, I guess, after what some of the restaurant operators reported last week?", "William J. DeLaney", "We don't comment on inter-quarter type of developments, but I would tell you that certainly, we service pretty much the whole spectrum of the marketplace, and you can see that we saw somewhat of a slowdown in the fourth quarter. Pricing eased a little bit as well, which was good, I think, but at the same time, our top line fell off some, and I think we're going to experience, to some degree, what you're seeing from some of the other people in the space.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Greg Badishkanian with Citi.", "Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Alvin Concepcion for Greg. Just wanted to ask another question related to the margin, gross margin. Sounds like there hasn't been much of a change in the promotional spending. What's your outlook on promotional spending in fiscal '13? And would you expect a year-over-year improvement in gross margin next year?", "William J. DeLaney", "Okay. Maybe I should take a minute and let's talk about promotional spending because that's 2 questions right off the bat. As far as I know, we don't really talk about promotional spending. So the bottom line is we do promote -- we have various marketing vehicles that we promote locally and to some extent here at corporate. That hasn't changed to any large extent over the last quarter, over the last year. I think as we've talked about margin pressure over the last 12 to 18 months, we've attributed a lot of that to the challenges of passing along mid to high single-digit rates of inflation in a marketplace that's still pretty fragile and just kind of an uneven business recovery on top of that. So I think -- I don't think this really has much to do with promotional spending. The bottom line is we're out there competing. We feel very appropriately and very aggressively in a pretty challenging marketplace. And we saw improvement, as you saw, and pointed out in the fourth quarter and certainly as we talked about in May, we expect to continue to improve those trends. But I don't believe that we've indicated in any way that we would expect to be over last year's gross profit.", "Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I see. And on the promotional spending front again, I mean, that's from your end, what about from the competitive standpoint? Are you seeing any changes there relative to last quarter?", "William J. DeLaney", "I'm sorry, could you repeat that question?", "Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, I'm just wondering if the competitive promotional environment has changed very much relative to last quarter.", "William J. DeLaney", "I don't think so. Again, I'm going to just attribute that to kind of the competitive environment. And we see different things in different parts of the country, and frankly, we see different behavior with different types of competitors. As you know, we deal with very large regional, national-type competitors, and then there's a lot of niche players as well. So I have to tell you that the environment remains very challenging from a competitive standpoint, and we expect it to continue that way. But I wouldn't say it's changed a whole lot.", "Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then the case volume growth in the quarter, it accelerated relative to last quarter, and obviously, I think you mentioned that you might see some more -- the weak restaurant traffic impact your results. I mean, can you talk about what some of the drivers were in the quarter in that accelerated improvement in case volumes?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, I think in this particular quarter, I don't know if there's anything particularly different than any other quarter. We're highly focused, as we've talked about at length over the last several calls and in our public presentations, on the importance for Sysco as a leader in the industry to continue to take share and to do that profitably. But we've got 8,000 marketing associates out there on the street. We've got a strong sales management team. We have great leadership throughout the country and in Canada, and we work very hard in staying close to our customers. All the basic things that we talk about every time we have an opportunity to speak publicly from menu analysis to good quality business reviews to a very focused time with our salespeople spending with their customers. Those are things that we feel we do better, by and large, than our competition. And as a result, that allows us to grow the business. So with that said, still very competitive and we still have some opportunity to work on our pricing and margin management.", "Operator", "And next, we'll hear from Ed Kelly with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Can I just start on the volume side, that 3.3% case volume growth. Can you talk about how that compares to sort of like the true underlying trend, and what I'm getting at is, an easy comparison this quarter versus last year. Did that play a role? Does weather and calendar play any role in this? And just, could you just give us a sense as to where you think the true business is running sort of underlying all that today? Is it really that level?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, yes, it is at that level. We'll take credit for it. I think going to your point, as you go back and look at the latter part of last fiscal year, maybe even the first quarter this year, the volume trends were a little bit more modest. And frankly, that led to us becoming more aggressive as we've talked about here in the last 2 or 3 quarters. So I would tell you that yes, we grew the cases 3%. Part of that was acquisitions, which we feel is a big part of our arsenal. And I wouldn't overweight comparisons when you're talking about the difference of 1% maybe from 1 year to the next, that type of thing. So we feel good with the volume, and we'll take credit for it.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And it sounds like, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, Bill, but it sounds like so far in the current quarter, things, just generally speaking, haven't been great but maybe haven't gotten worse. Is that how I should read that?", "William J. DeLaney", "Things are always great here at Sysco. But no, look, the market, what I'm trying to tell you here without getting into a disclosure area that I can't, is that we're going to participate in what goes on in the market. So I expect us to continue to grow cases. I expect us to take share and to some extent, as we've talked about in terms of our medium to longer-term outlook, we are going to be impacted by the market itself. So to the extent that we see a slowdown as this quarter proceeds, I'm sure we'll feel that to some degree.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then on gross profit dollar growth relative to case growth, this was another quarter where it was slightly less, and I know that's not your long-term goal. So could you maybe just walk through a little bit what was the driver there? And then how long do you think it takes to get us to the point where gross profit dollars maybe are doing a little bit better than volumes again?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, we need to get there. It's the bottom line. It's a very fair question. So the way I look at it is we did better in the fourth quarter than we did in the third in terms of that particular relationship but not good enough. So we need to continue, as I mentioned a question or 2 ago, to strike a better balance between the case growth and the gross profit dollars. So I'm encouraged that we saw some modest improvement but there's a ways to go. And all I can tell you is that we're highly focused on it here as a management team and throughout the country, into our sales management and into our sales force. So it's a delicate balance in terms of the economy and the marketplace and trying to be responsive to the needs of our customers, but we certainly see that as an issue and an opportunity for improvement.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the MEPP side, maybe could you give us a little bit more color on the charge this quarter? And then within your 10-K last year, you disclosed about a couple hundred million dollar withdrawal liability. And I'm just curious as to how that's calculated. Is that your actuarial value of the underfunding? And could you also give us some sense as to what you think the fair value of the underfunding might be at this point?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "That question just got worse and worse.", "William J. DeLaney", "Time for Chris to answer a question there.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Started off I said, I can do this one and then you just took it down the rabbit hole. Let me see if I can help. The charge this quarter was related to Cleveland. So 220 employees at our Cleveland operating company withdrew from the Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters plan, and therefore we recorded a withdrawal liability of approximately $17 million. We did have some liabilities earlier in the year that were basically true-ups of prior year withdrawals. And the way that works is you have to record the liability at the value that you know when the withdrawal was actually made. But then, each quarter thereafter there are going to be true-ups until you actually are allowed to withdraw from that particular plan, which can be 1.5 years later. So I think that's the first part of your question. The second part, we've generally recorded in our 10-K roughly $200 million of liability. I wouldn't call that an actuarial. That is basically our assessment of the materials that we get from those plan trustees about the status of their plans. We don't manage those plans, we just get materials. And unfortunately, it takes a long time for us to get those materials. We're still stating that liability based upon materials that are as old as year-end 2009 to 2010, so they're just not given to us very timely. And the 10-K that you'll see in a couple of weeks, we'll update that number, which is just, as we described it, it's the total withdrawal or the potential liability if we withdrew from all the plans, which is, of course, not something we would ever foresee doing. But then under new guidelines, we're required to put down a number that we believe is related to plans from which we would reasonably, possibly, either voluntarily withdraw or there would be a mass withdrawal. That number is about half that $200 million. It's about $100 million. Did that get close to answering your question?", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes, I think. And I think when your K comes out, we'll probably be able to do more work on that as well. Another question for you on the national account pricing. I don't -- I'm not sure if I heard this correctly, but it sounded to me like you had suggested that pricing would be moving to the SBS level. Is that right?", "William J. DeLaney", "No, not the negotiation of pricing or the relationships. We handle our contract customers in various ways, but we have a significant group that works out of the corporate office that covers what we call corporate multiunit, and then we obviously have regional and local chains that we tend to handle those relationships locally through the operating companies. What's going on at SBS is more just the facilitation of the processes themselves.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And one last question for you here. Your CapEx guidance, I think, was a little bit higher today than at the analyst meeting. And then related to that, with the IRS payment being done, you should start generating some free cash flow again. So the question is, what do you guys plan on doing with that free cash flow?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "The CapEx actually is in line with what we talked about at Investor Day. You're focused on the $600 million that I showed at Investor Day, but right underneath that was a line for business transformation capitalization, which was a range of $5 million to $20 million. So depending on where you are in that range, we just put a range around CapEx, $600 million to $650 million. Nothing has really changed in the assumptions that we're using for this year. We just put a range around it so I think it's generally in line with what we talked about. We do intend to generate additional free cash flow this year. We've not changed our posture with regards to how we view our cash. We're reinvesting into the business. We're certainly making sure that we can have a substantial and growing dividend, and we're looking for additional acquisitions as much as possible. If we start to generate significant additional free cash, we'll take a look, again, at the shares. But right now, that's just not the case.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "On the -- I wanted to ask, did the lower rates of inflation, did that help with the gross margin management? I know you said, sounded like you're just getting a little more acumen with managing it. But I just want to -- in relation to lower inflation, did that help? Do you think a lower inflation had any effect on the case growth?", "William J. DeLaney", "Andy, I'll start there. Sure, it helps. I mean, as we've talked over the last 2 or 3 quarters, there's a certain math to this whole inflation discussion. So when you go from 5.5% to 3.5%, give or take, that definitely helps. And it goes category by category, that type of thing. So there's no doubt that, that contributed to it, as well as I do think we executed, as I said, modestly better and there's plenty of room for improvement there. I think as far as case growth, I don't know that, that happens quite as fast. I know there's kind of this analytical way of looking at it. The key for us, I think, as it relates to the inflation is over the medium to long term, we've been very consistent on this and we truly believe it is that it's just better for our customers and our customers' customers if we can see a more moderate level of say 2 to 3 points of inflation over time. That's just a better environment for business, and whether it be our customers or ourselves. And so I think, if we can stay there and be relatively consistent and not have too much volatility in the respective categories, I think that's more of a medium-term benefit for us.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. On the case growth getting better, how do you -- how do we look at that or how do you look at that? Was any of that improvement or at same customers? Or was it really mainly new customers and really taking market share in that way?", "William J. DeLaney", "It's a combination of 3 things. We continue to improve our customer retention. That's had a lot of focus here, and we've talked about it somewhat publicly. So our customer retention numbers have improved over the last year or 2 and that certainly helps. We have seen penetration. That's obviously going to vary by customer and be somewhat dependent on how healthy their business is, but overall, we've seen some case penetration. And yes, largely or not largely, but we tend to do a good job on new business as well. So it comes from the 2 that you mentioned, which is new business as well as penetration. But also, again, just an environment like this, we just need to stay closer and closer to our customers and just minimize lost accounts.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. Are you willing to say if it's more one than the other?", "William J. DeLaney", "I'd be willing to say if I knew. I mean, it's actually -- it's hard to kind of get precise information on that, but I actually think it's a little bit of all 3, Andy.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Fair enough. My last question is back to the pension freeze. I had to drop off the call for a second. Could you just give the swing, what this year's swing for that? I think you gave the numbers in --  or the numbers that get us to the math, either way.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes. And actually, I think, we flashed the chart on the screen as we were going through it. But the net-net is an increase of about $25 million for this year, and it would have gone up over $100 million save for the freeze and then we expect it to be lower in '14.", "William J. DeLaney", "I think there's a broader issue here, though, Andy. And obviously, this is a very sensitive issue internally and it's just being announced today, clearly, throughout Sysco. So we've been looking at this for a period of time, and the reality is as growth has slowed industry-wise and even for Sysco, we've continued to see the liability of the pension plan grow meaningfully faster than the business is growing. So the broader picture here is that we needed to address that in a prudent way, and we feel that we have and we feel, as we communicate the new planned structure with the 401(k), I think our folks will find that it's a very competitive plan and provides a lot of opportunity to appropriately save for retirement.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Absolutely. I mean, you definitely were one of the last companies with a generous pension plan. I just wanted to ask us one last thing about that, then I'm going to drop off, is from my understanding of these plans is they have different vesting, 20, 25 years and so on. And obviously, that helps to keep senior management in place. What's going to happen with those provisions? Are those also frozen, or does the vesting continue just with no more increased contribution?", "William J. DeLaney", "Which plans are you talking about, Andy?", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "So your plans are fully vested without relation to time of service?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, the pension plan you do vest over time in the pension plan. What we're doing is we're freezing the pension plan. Whatever benefits you have today, you retain. All of your new benefits will come from a 401(k) defined contribution plan going forward. So upon retirement, what you'll have is the vested benefits in your pension from the date at which we froze it plus your defined contribution benefit that grew from that point going forward.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Yes. So if somebody's a year away from the hurdle for vesting, next year it'll vest, it'll just be on today's amount.", "William J. DeLaney", "That's correct. And just a point of interest, I mean, our plans, I don't have the specifics but our vesting tends to be pretty much 100% within 5 or 7 years, something like that. So you vest relatively quickly here. So most of our people are vested, and then it will work like you say. And then what we'll be doing over the next few weeks is communicating the components of the 401(k) plan and so on and so forth.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I recall you guys saying in the past that 1% to 2% inflation is a sweet spot for you, and it appears like we're heading there. And I guess, my question is why won't your gross margins be up in 2013 if that happens if we hit your sweet spot? Or are gross margins going to keep going down regardless of the level of inflation because of the broader industry conditions?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, obviously, Michael, we don't have the answers to those questions. Those are great questions. I would tell you, we've had now 1 quarter of 3% inflation, and it looks like this quarter's starting now in a similar way. So I mean, I think we will see some moderate inflation for a period of time. We're not clear on how long that'll stabilize given what's going on with the droughts and various things around the world. So I think we need to wait and see to some extent how this thing plays out here over the next 6, 9, 12 months. What I said and what I do believe is, I think, the lower inflation will take some pressure off of our customers, and that will take some pressure off of us, so that should support some of the initiatives we have to strike the right balance between growth and margins. But the other thing I'm saying is what I also said pretty consistently is this is different than 2 years ago or 4 years ago or 5 years ago. Until this economy shows more consistent improvement and until our customers participate in that, there's going to continue to be a lot of pricing pressure out there. So I'm not saying that we can't improve our margins over time, I'm just saying we need to take it one step at a time and right now, our goals are -- is to reverse the trends that we saw this past year.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And the spike in grain that you alluded to, I mean, what kind of a lag before something like that will hit your P&L? And when it does, whether it's a quarter from now or 2 quarters from now, whatever the right answer is there, should we expect that the pace of gross margin declines to accelerate again as we get into the heart of 2013?", "William J. DeLaney", "I don't know. I wish I did know and I wish I could give you more specific answers there. But typically, what happens is it takes a while for it to work itself through the food chain, into the meal for the cattle and the poultry and all that, so works its way through the feedstock and then into our cost of center of play items. And I would expect that, that will take 3 to 6 months at least for us to see that play out. And we'll just have to see how the business climate is in general. So we're not hiding behind that. We would love to see a nice, stable inflation environment but I'm just pointing out that we could see some pressure on pricing here later in the year. That's all.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And kind of switching gears, another thing, you had mentioned that in 2013 that acquisitions would drive over 1% to sales. That actually hasn't happened in 7 years, and so I thought that was interesting. I was curious if there was one specific acquisition of size that's in the pipeline that you're thinking about? Or if it's reflective of a bunch of smaller deals? And if it's one of size, is it in the U.S. or international? Is it a traditional competitor or somehow tangential? Just kind of a better idea as to where you guys are going on the acquisition side would be great.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, what we continue to talk about on the acquisition side is a string, as many as possible, of these smaller transactions that are, in combination, become meaningful to us, so that's what we said. We did 9 transactions for $270 million. Actually, I think, last year, we were above 1%. I'd have to go back and check my numbers, but I thought we were just above 1%. But our goal has been 0.5 to 1 point. What we're really pointing out is we're starting to accelerate that and we're starting to increase our pipeline. Our goal this year is north of 1% through a combination of these smaller-ish transactions. I don't want to characterize them as being small and meaningless. They're not at all. Every one of them is important to us, but they're smaller than the $500 million or $600 million regional-sized transactions that we'd love to get, but are just frankly very, very difficult to get and they don't come along very often.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then lastly on these changes to the retirement plans. Just simplistically, is your pension expense no longer going to move with interest rates as we look forward? If -- I mean, just so I understand when you say a freeze, I mean, is that -- are interest rates no longer relevant for you?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, they're very relevant to us. We still have a $1 billion-plus pension plan that's out there that has to be revalued every year. What the freeze does is it stops growing in terms of the assets and the liabilities, so that's [indiscernible] the growth of it will now cease. The next step in managing our retirement plans is starting to go after the volatility of those assets, and we do have more work going on in that area as well. But as Bill said, this is something we've been looking at for a while. Pension expense has been going up significantly over the last few years. It was growing at a rate that was just frankly not sustainable, and so we needed to come up with a different set of plans that would be beneficial to our employees and to help with retention of our employees and help them plan for their retirements, while at the same time not causing our expenses to grow at a rate that's frankly our earnings could not sustain. So we've looked at a number of things. Step one is we've got to freeze what's there. Now we've got to go about looking at how we reduce the volatility of the liabilities that still exist on the balance sheet.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And are you guys still then at this point looking at what your assumptions are for your existing exposure? And how conservative do you feel like those assumptions are at this point given how long interest rates have stayed low and returns have stayed low?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Well, so there are 2 separate components to figuring out the pension expense. Obviously, the first one is discount rate, which we unfortunately have nothing to do with. Interest rates drive down the discount rate. It's declined even more this year from a rate that I didn't think it could even decline from last year, so that cost us a tremendous amount of valuation and was driving our interest -- or driving our pension expense to be significantly higher for '13. The second component is the discount rate that you -- or sorry, the return that you assume on the portfolio. We evaluate that every year. You look at 70 years' worth of history on a portfolio of assets that you invest in. Obviously, the last 10 years are not good compared to that 70-year history, and so we're constantly evaluating, are we too aggressive? Are we too conservative? That's something we evaluate every year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "If you look at the gross margin rate, I was curious how your new business wins look versus the existing book on the gross profit rate.", "William J. DeLaney", "Great question, Mark. It's another one of those ones that when you have as much new business as we have, I mean, you're talking about double-digit new business, it's hard to critique that, but I would say it's a mixture. Generally, the new business, as it comes these days, comes a little bit harder and a little bit more competitively. So I don't have a lot of data on that in terms of the entire company. But more than likely, it probably comes in a little bit less than the average would be my best judgment on that.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And as we look at the business transformation savings as they come in, what kind of timing should we expect on that? Is this something that builds throughout the year? Or do you expect any quarters bigger than others?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "We've not given any quarterly breakout of that, but I think it would be fairly safe to assume it will build over time. Just as it's going to build over the 3-year period, it's going to build during each of those 3 years.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the inflation, what is your protein team saying? It seems like there's a pretty good chance you're going to be looking at much higher inflation next year. I'm curious what your thoughts are there.", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, we're seeing higher prices now in beef and poultry. And we're seeing deflation actually in dairy and produce right now, and then everything else is kind of around the average. So they're pretty much saying what we're reading and what I tried to say earlier, which is that we should expect to see some pressure as the year goes along.", "Operator", "And next we'll hear from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Yes, I just wanted to get some more color on your outlook, your near-term outlook for ERP in fiscal '13. So could you maybe talk about how much your guidance is in related as far as expenses and the projected cost savings? It looks like $150 million is still what you're roughly expecting on the cost savings side. But if at some point over the next year, it looks like you're not getting the benefits at the rate that you're currently looking for, I mean, would you still plan on absorbing as much as $350 million on ERP cost? How much variability could there potentially be on the expense side?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, Ajay, those 2 things really aren't tied. So as we tried to do during the Investor Day, we tried to explain that the expenses are primarily due to the technological implementation of our new ERP system. So the $300 million to $350 million, net of direct benefits from SBS, that's the expense that we plan to incur as we now implement and roll out the ERP system, and we gave guidance of 520 companies during the course of the year. Bill gave you a little more color about where the next 5 of those were going to be. So that's kind of part A. Part B is we also have the business transformation initiatives, cost-saving initiatives, that do not rely upon that technology to go forward. And so we're going down the road on a variety of those that we outlined in great detail, and that's where we expect to receive the 25% of our overall benefit in the first year.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. I just had one follow-up question. It's maybe just a variation of some of the questions that have been asked on inflation. So just wondering internally, how concerned are you guys based on the current weather and drought conditions that a lot of that recent volume improvement, case volume improvement, begins to slip away very quickly if inflation starts to get out of control?", "William J. DeLaney", "I don't think we're overly concerned, at least, not any more concerned in the last 2 or 3 years, Ajay. I mean, it's part of what you deal within this business and when you put it in the context of some of the other challenges that we have out there in terms of the marketplace and our customers' ability to grow and that kind of thing, I think it's certainly -- we take it seriously. But it's also -- comes into the bucket that we don't really have much of an ability to influence it. So I wouldn't -- I'd be probably more concerned about the economy and whether we can see a little bit more stability and a little more consistent improvement there, because then that creates a mindset in the consumer wanting to go out to eat more, and that's always the key, I think, for our business is that people want to go out to eat and they're not totally focused on what it's going to cost or how many times they go out and all that kind of thing. I mean, right now, our information is a little dated, but we're still seeing increases in traffic and check size. And it varies between concept and that kind of thing. But we just need to see improved -- consistently improving psyche of the consumer, and I think we can weather the rest of it.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "So can you comment as far as quarter-to-date have volume trends deteriorated at all sequentially?", "William J. DeLaney", "I really can't. As I mentioned earlier, we just don't do that. But again, you know us real well and we play in the entire space in this market so to the extent that you're seeing softness out there, we would certainly expect to participate in some of that as the quarter goes along.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "And finally, can you confirm if there were any quantifiable ERP benefits in the fourth quarter?", "William J. DeLaney", "We really didn't look at it that way, to be honest. I'm sure they were modest, but essentially what we have said is -- what Chris just talked you through, is we've laid this thing on in terms of our roadmap, and we're looking to knock down about 25% of that cost savings here this year. And it's going to come from operations, it's going to come from SG&A and it's probably going to come a little bit more toward the end of the year than at the beginning of the year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "At this point, I think it's fairly short. You made a comment, and I think it was Chris that did, I don't remember, talking about expending Sysco beyond the core over time. And I guess, is that a 2013 event? Is that the type of technology initiatives that may come from Sysco ventures or are there other things that we should be thinking about in near-term significance just to put some parameters around that?", "William J. DeLaney", "John, it's Bill. I think that was actually in my prepared comments. So Chris can take a break here. No, it's no different than what we've talked about before. I think, again, in terms of our communications and messaging, we want to make sure that all of our constituents understand that we're primarily focused on the core right now. We've got a lot going on, a lot of opportunity out there. But yes, we continue to look for ways to grow in an adjacent manner. And over time, we still would like to grow international. But I didn't put a timeline on that as much as I said. Over time, I think was actually words that I used. So it's more of a strategic objective here over the medium term.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And you said outside the core is international as opposed to something within the U.S.?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, it could be -- we could look at adjacencies of the Sysco ventures as you mentioned as kind of bridges both as you start talking to folks who have opportunities for us to partner with in terms of business solutions that are more technology-driven, those types of things. But the attraction there, obviously, is to create a stronger relationship with our customer base and more traction to help them grow and to solidify our position with our customers over time. So no, it would be both adjacencies as well as international.", "Operator", "And our question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I first want to just talk about the money, the 25% of savings that you're expecting to get this year. That isn't really part of business transformation process, right? Those are a whole set of separate initiatives that you've started working on last year -- or this year, I should say this year, is that right, '12?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, we view all of the initiatives that we have undertaken as part of the transformation of our business from what was the old the business model, if you will, to what needs to be the new business model in order to compete going forward. Many of them originally were described as being enabled by this new ERP system. And as we got further and further into the ERP system design and implementation, we realized we did not need to wait on the ERP system in order to attack some of these other business transformation initiatives. So now we're talking about them as separate streams of work, but it's all under the moniker of business transformation because frankly most of this is different than what we've done before.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So they're not actually benefits from the ERP system, there's just other ways to save money?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, that's fair. I mean, again, business transformation is not ERP. ERP is the technology change that we set out to put in place several years ago. And again, the original plan if we step back before my time, but I certainly understand it now, the original plan was if we're going to do through all the work to develop and design a new ERP system that changes all of our processes, everything about how we go to market, let's go and do this operating company by operating company and change the business model one at a time. So everything was really on one kind of rollout schedule. As we got further into it, we realized it doesn't need to be done that way, and especially as the ERP implementation slowed down, we realized we needed to go faster on the rest of it. So we just disconnected them.", "William J. DeLaney", "Meredith, if I could just jump in there, I want to -- there's a key point and I think it's key to anybody who would be listening to this call, inside or outside Sysco. If you go back to our May presentation there with all of you, we took a fair amount of time to reframe this deal and to, if you will, rebrand it to some extent from a standpoint of what Chris just took you through. So business transformation is essentially us coming to grips with what we need to do, the changes we need to make in terms of our processes, how we go to market to continue to enhance our leadership position in this industry going forward for the next 5 or 10 years. Now 3 and 4 years ago, when we had more of a design than anything else, we bundled it all together in terms of one. So where we sit today, we're talking to you about deploying the technology platform effectively throughout Sysco so that's one big bucket. And then we're talking about taking a look holistically at all of our practices in terms of how we run the business, selling, general, administrative, all the different things that we do, how we organize the company and revisiting those, some of which, as Chris said, would have been part of the original business case for 2012, a few of which weren't; many of which do not require new technology platform to get those going because a lot of it has to do with a more consistent go-to-market implementation of our business practices. And then third is sitting down and partnering with our suppliers, our product suppliers and finding more efficient and more effective ways of sharing cost savings on product, and at the same time doing it in a way where we can grow the business. So this is a key point. The business transformation going forward for Sysco encompasses all 3 of those buckets, if you will, and not just the technology platform. Now we can't get to the finish line without the technology platform. So that remains very foundational, as I said, in my comments. But it's just one piece of it.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess where I was confused is I thought some of these new cost saving initiatives truly were new and had not originally been envisioned when you laid this out. But you're saying it's just an acceleration of how you implement those things.", "William J. DeLaney", "I'm saying there's a lot of that, and then I'm also saying, look, we're running a business here, right, so we're somewhat behind on the deployment schedule. We've got some cost overruns, so we're running the business and we've taken stock over the last 6 to 9 months of other things that we can do in the company to offset the cost overrun. So it's a combination but largely it's an acceleration of the original business case.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. That's very clear. I have one other question. This wasn't a great year for the company as a whole, and I don't know how that compared to your internal plan. But I was wondering what happened with bonuses for the company this year? Were they up or down versus last year and kind of how did that play out over the quarters?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Well, we haven't actually talked about bonuses internally, but I can describe our bonus objectives to you. From the corporate perspective, we basically had 3 bonus objectives: The one was sales, which we have actually achieved our plan and actually somewhat exceeded our plan in terms of sales. We had one that was operating profit and that, of course, was as you -- I'll use your words, was not good in terms of the year. And then one was return on invested capital, and that one kind of went the same way as operating profit. If you don't get your earnings, it's very hard to achieve your ROIC objectives as well. So while we haven't, I don't think we fully ruled on what the bonus outcome is to the employees, that's the general sense of where we were. Compared to last year from a corporate perspective, I would say we'll definitely be lower than the last year, where we had a slightly different bonus plan. Now the operating companies have their own bonus plans. Typically, they're tied partially to the corporate, their leadership team, but then also predominantly to their own performances. So those are going to vary depending upon the performance of the operating company.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And have you -- the fourth quarter numbers, do those reflect any assumption about bonus for the year, or is that something that gets actually recorded in fiscal '13?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, we had already adjusted and accrued appropriately for where we thought the payouts would be.", "William J. DeLaney", "So, I think, Meredith, just I'll pile on here a little bit. You're going to see different results on bonus so you won't see them but, obviously, we had some operating companies that performed well above plan and plan, and those folks will make some bonuses and some who didn't. To Chris's point overall, we didn't achieve our earnings goals for the year, so we will not hit our target bonus, but we will pay bonuses this year. I don't know what it is compared to last year to be straight with you, but as Chris also pointed out, we moved to more of a plan-based bonus structure this year and, I think, in the end I think you're going to find it to be very appropriate.", "Operator", "And with no further questions, we'd like to thank you all for your participation.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Neil A. Russell", "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Sysco's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. On today's call, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made in the course of this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In addition, all references to case volume growth include total Broadline and SYGMA combined.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported record sales of $11.1 billion for the first quarter and net earnings of $287 million. Earnings per share was $0.49 and adjusted earnings per share, representing our underlying business performance, was $0.58 or a 3.6% increase year-over-year. Sales grew 4.7% for the quarter, driven mainly by case volume growth of 2.9%, which contributed to the highest quarterly sales level in our history. While we believe restaurant spending trends may have softened somewhat as the quarter progressed, we are pleased with our overall volume growth during the quarter.", "Acquisitions contributed 0.5% to sales growth during the first quarter, and we have completed or announced, thus far this fiscal year, the acquisition of companies with annual revenues totaling approximately $560 million, several of which expand our presence in geographic markets that we currently serve outside the United States. The acquisition environment is currently favorable, and we have a number of potential opportunities in the pipeline.", "Product cost inflation moderated to 2.2% for the quarter, which is beneficial for both Sysco and our customers. While our growth in adjusted operating income was modest, we are encouraged by our expense management performance in most areas of the business. Specifically, we experienced lower cost per case in our selling and administrative areas as a result of enhanced business practices and effective leveraging of this quarter's volume growth. Conversely, higher fuel prices, labor shortages in some markets that we operate in and execution issues on our part led to higher year-over-year delivery cost per case. We are fully committed to both servicing our customers at a high level and improving productivity in all parts of our business as we move forward.", "Turning to our business transformation efforts. We continue to make progress on deploying our new and enhanced technology platform. Just prior to last quarter's call, we converted our East Texas operating company to our new ERP system, our third location to go live. That conversion went very well, and we moved forward with our planned conversions at our operating companies in North Texas and West Texas last week. The early results in both locations are generally favorable, and we will continue to assess the performance of these 2 companies closely over the next several weeks. These 2 deployments represent a critical step in our technology implementation timeline for 2 reasons: One, it is the first incidence of multiple operating companies converting simultaneously; and two, the North Texas location is one of our largest operating companies and services a significant number of our corporate multi-unit customers.", "We are pursuing a market-based approach for our rollout schedule. As a result, we expect to move forward with our next planned conversions in Texas and Louisiana in the coming quarters. As we prepare for these conversions, we are also evaluating the possibility of potentially accelerating our pace of deployment in fiscal 2014 and beyond.", "I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many associates that are engaged in this project, including those at the operating companies that have or are preparing to convert to the new technology platform, as well as those at SBS, IT and across the company. The very real progress we are making in transforming our business would not be possible without their hard work and dedication to the success of this project.", "I also want to acknowledge a new member of the team. We welcomed Wayne Shurts in October as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Wayne brings extensive experience in both the food business, as well as the deployment of large technology projects. His capabilities complement our team as we work to increasingly leverage the opportunities technology can bring to our business.", "Beyond the technology deployment portion of our business transformation journey, we are rapidly rolling out several other key initiatives. For example, we are building the foundation for enhanced customer insights through direct feedback from our customers, prospects and associates. We have also recently rolled out our first-ever customer relationship management or CRM platform, which will permit our sales managers and marketing associates to service their customers more effectively, operate more efficiently and accelerate our sales growth over time. In addition, we're exploring multiple ways to reduce our operating cost structure and have recently identified significant potential savings in our IT support function.", "Regarding Hurricane Sandy. While it is difficult for us to accurately estimate the full impact to our customers, I do want to provide you with some relevant updates: First, our employees are safe; second, we know that many of our customers were impacted more severely than us, and we're doing everything we can to help them; third, there was no substantial damage to any of our facilities. While we did have some intermittent power outages, our backup generators operated effectively, and as such, our inventory is secure; fourth, due to on-site fueling capabilities, we have adequate fuel supplies to make deliveries; and finally, obviously, there were initially some road closures and power outages that limited some deliveries. However, our operations have recovered relatively well, and we are ready to serve our customers as they are able to get back to business as usual.", "In closing, it seems appropriate and timely to remind all of us that Sysco is in the midst of a great deal of change. Not only is this change necessary at this point in our 40-plus year history as a public company, but it will result in a much stronger Sysco for years to come. We will build upon our industry leadership position by becoming a much leaner, more agile and easier company for our customers and suppliers to do business with. We are most fortunate to have 47,000 highly committed and capable associates to lead us through this exciting period in Sysco's history.", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the first quarter.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $11.1 billion or an increase of 4.7% compared to the prior year, driven by case volume growth of 2.9% and food cost inflation of 2.2%. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 0.5%, and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.3%.", "Gross profit in the first quarter increased 2.9%. While gross margin in the first quarter declined 33 basis points to 18.1%, it's important to note that this performance significantly improved as the quarter progressed. Operating expenses increased $87 million or 6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior-year period, driven mainly by a $41 million increase in business transformation expenses and a $30 million increase in salaries and related costs. As a result, operating income decreased $31 million or 6%. Net earnings for the first quarter were $287 million, a decrease of $16 million or 5.3% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.49, a 3.9% decrease compared to the prior year.", "As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it's important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes $6 million in certain items such as severance but also excludes business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 3.2%, adjusted operating income increased 2%, adjusted net earnings grew 3.2%; and adjusted EPS grew 3.6% to $0.58 per share.", "As Bill mentioned, the acquisition environment is currently quite favorable, and we have been very active in this area. To date in fiscal 2013, we have completed or announced 6 acquisitions of annual revenues totaling approximately $560 million, including 2 transactions which occurred subsequent to the end of the first quarter. As a result, we expect to exceed our goal of adding 0.5% to 1% in sales from acquisitions this fiscal year, and we still have a number of additional potential transactions in the pipeline that we are working to complete over the next few quarters.", "Building on our successful 2009 acquisition of Pallas Foods, we've recently added 2 new distributors to our family of companies in Ireland. We acquired Crossgar Foodservice, a Broadline distributor, during the quarter, and in early October completed the acquisition of the foodservice distribution division of Keelings, a specialty produce company. Both of these companies have great people, and we are excited to add them to our Sysco family. We believe that building a market leadership presence in Ireland similar to our efforts in the U.S. and Canada provides us strategic advantages and offers our existing and potential customers a broader choice of products and services.", "In addition to Ireland, we continue to expand in Canada. Over the last year, we have been strategically building our presence in the province of Qu\u00e9bec. This is a well-populated area of Canada, home to roughly 8 million people, and we believe we have significant opportunities to increase our market share here. As a result, we have completed several acquisitions in Montr\u00e9al, including a company specializing in Italian imports; a meat processor and distributor; and a seafood company.", "In addition, in late October, we announced our agreement to acquire Distagro, the foodservice division of a Montreal-based grocery retailer. This is our largest acquisition so far this year and is designed to complement our growing presence in this highly competitive market. The Distagro transaction is subject to Canadian regulatory approval, and we expect to complete that acquisition by the end of the calendar year.", "Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the first quarter, project expenses totaled $78 million, and we capitalized $3 million related to the project. In the prior-year quarter, project expenses totaled $37 million, and we capitalized $45 million related to the project. As Bill mentioned, considering the successful implementation of our third operating company, and dependent upon how the next few weeks go for North Texas and West Texas, we have begun to explore what is necessary to potentially accelerate the deployment schedule beginning next year.", "We continue to make progress on our other key business transformation initiatives as well. In the first quarter, we announced our decision to outsource a portion of our IT resources to a third party. The changes in the organization will result in significant financial benefit over time and is included in the total business transformation benefits that we expect to achieve. Due to our progress on this and other initiatives, we believe we are on track with the business transformation financial objectives we provided at Investor Day last year.", "Turning to our cash flow performance. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $213 million, a decline of $42 million, driven mainly by increased tax payments and lower earnings, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization. The IRS settlement payments we paid last year will begin to impact the year-over-year operating cash flow comparison beginning in the second quarter. As a reminder, during fiscal 2012, we paid a total of $212 million in settlement payments, none of which was paid in the first quarter, $106 million that was paid in the second quarter and $53 million that was paid in each of the last 2 quarters.", "Capital expenditures totaled $156 million for the first quarter this year compared to $227 million last year. The $71 million decline in capital spending is driven in part by a reduction in business transformation capital spend and in part by a reduction in the number of major facilities -- facility projects this year compared to last.", "As a result of the reduction in capital spending, free cash flow doubled year-over-year to $58 million. We expect the effect of lower capital spending this year, combined with the completion of the IRS payment last year, will result in an improvement in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.", "Before we close, I wanted to update you on our fuel guidance for the year. Our process each quarter is to project the impact of fuel prices using, among other inputs, forward fuel prices. While we are hearing continued discussion in the market about a potential decline in fuel prices, there has been little impact yet in the forward prices. As a result, our current and projected rates for fuel had increased since our last forecast, which result in an estimated increase in fuel expense for the year of $10 million to $20 million.", "In closing, while fiscal year 2013 is a critical year for us as we begin -- as we work towards significant milestones in our ERP deployments and begin to realize benefits from several areas of our business transformation plan, we are beginning to see a consistent uptick in momentum underlying our efforts. This is evident in the increased confidence throughout the organization, in particular as it relates to the deployment of our new technology platform. I believe this favorably positions us to take advantage of opportunities to grow our market share and expand upon our leadership position in the industry.", "With that, operator, we'll take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Karen Short, BMO Capital Markets.", "Ryan Gilligan", "This is actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. We wanted to ask you about the inventory opportunity in terms of reducing SKU counts in your categories and the progress you've made so far, specifically in the categories that you've approached already. What has been the response from customers and what has been the impact on cost of goods?", "William J. DeLaney", "This is Bill. I'd say on the SKU opportunities, we have kind of a 2-pronged approach right now. We, from an operational standpoint, have a lot of activity going on in our operating companies where, basically, it's what I would characterize as good old-fashioned inventory management where we see opportunities to reduce SKUs that are not critical to customers and which are slow-moving, then we do have -- brought a lot of focus to that particular an issue. So we've actually made good progress on that side of things. And generally, that's being handled well with customers. And any time you have a situation where you're reducing a SKU that -- or taking away a SKU that sells, often there will be some type of discussion with the salesperson or the customer. But we're working through those and I feel pretty good about that. As part of our lower costing products initiative, we've talked about exploring category management. And that will bring a much more integrated and smoother approach to how do we optimize our assortments throughout the enterprise and manage SKUs more effectively at the same time. So that work has not yet begun in terms of being live, but we're doing a lot of development work on that front as well.", "Ryan Gilligan", "Great. And can you talk about the cadence of sales trends throughout the quarter and into the second?", "William J. DeLaney", "I would characterize sales trends pretty much what I said in my prepared comments. We certainly read a lot from you folks in terms of softening in the restaurant industry, and we think we've seen some of that as the quarter's gone along, and that's continued here somewhat in the early part of the second quarter. So the good news for us, and this is just something we always try to remind everybody, restaurants are obviously a big part of that $225 billion market, but we have a lot of other business beyond the restaurant business with colleges, universities, health care, hotels, basically any establishment where food is prepared and eaten away from home. So we\u2019ve made some good strides with some of those customers, and that's serving us well right now.", "Ryan Gilligan", "Great. And, sorry, last question, just to go back to the opportunity with reducing cost of goods. The estimate that you outlined at the Analyst Day, could that possibly be conservative, or how are you guys thinking about that right now?", "William J. DeLaney", "It's not conservative until we beat it, so I think at this point, that's our best guidance for you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So Bill, a couple of things. One of the reasons gross margin had declined over the last 1, 1.5 years, had been some proactive price investments you guys had made. Where do you stand on that? And assuming that, that's moderating, is there a possibility here that gross margin turns positive some time in '13?", "William J. DeLaney", "I certainly hope so, John. We're pleased that the trends have improved, but obviously, they're still below last year. And I think in this type of market where the inflation has moderated, as we called out, we would expect to continue to see improvement in those trends. So we're highly focused on that is about all I can tell you. We've done a lot of work internally, John, outside of the big initiatives in terms of providing what we call more market-relevant costing to our operating companies through our purchasing organization here. And I think as we continue to provide better and more market-oriented, market-relevant transfer costing, and that gives the OpCos a better cost base to price off of. So there's a lot of different things going on there. So I'm going to answer it similar to your earlier question. We need to improve, continue to improve in that area. And as we get closer to year-over-year being flat, then I'll be more optimistic about improving year-over-year.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "You also talked about the acquisition environment being very favorable. Now is that -- I guess it's a combination of these 2 things, but in terms of quality of companies available versus the price that you're having to pay, is 1 of those 2 much more favorable than the other?", "William J. DeLaney", "That's an interesting question. I'll start and let our acquisition guy here probably clean it up here a little bit. I would say there's a couple of things going on right now. I think the environment is good. There's a little bit, I think, of a year-end phenomenon going on, with concerns about tax code and that kind of thing, so I think that has helped at least in this country. But I would also tell you that this interest rate phenomena, I think, works both ways. So for us, it helps the deals look more attractive, obviously, since our borrowing costs will be a lot less. But the sellers know that as well. So I think for good value in terms of quality companies, you're going to pay an appropriate multiple today, and we're willing to do that because we can see the benefits financially and otherwise. So hopefully, that's a response. So I think that's a better environment, but we're not stealing any companies right now. We're talking about good companies and pay reasonable value.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I don't really have anything to add, Bill. Bill kind of couched it. The only thing I'll amplify is we have seen substantial increase in inbound phone calls because of the potential for tax rate increases in the beginning of next year. So you\u2019ve got a little bit of that rush to get it done phenomena. But we're fortunate; we're seeing a lot of good companies that haven't been interested in talking before coming forward and wanting to have discussions, and some of those will result in transactions soon and some may result in transactions later. But we're happy to talk to everybody.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. Then last on ERP. So Chris, you said none of the financial objectives have changed. I assume the costs and benefits you'd outlined for '13, none of those have changed?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "That is correct.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then accelerating it in '14. How many of OpCos do you think you have done by the end of fiscal '13? And then what's the capacity, if you look at it per week, per month, however you want to look at it, the capacity the organization has to do those? And if you do accelerate it, what do you do to enable you to accelerate it?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Well, John, first, I mean, our guidance for the year was 5 to 15 companies, and we're certainly comfortable with that guidance. If I were going to shade it, I mean on the pace that we're at, as long as things continue to go well, I think we'll be towards the higher end of that guidance. But we're very comfortable with that. As Bill said, and I repeated, we are looking at now what it would take to accelerate that based upon us starting to feel better about our deployment capabilities. I think it's premature to give you more guidance as to how fast we could go or how many we could do at a time until we finish that work.", "Operator", "And up next is Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Could we maybe go back to ERP? And I was hoping you could maybe give us a little bit more color around the decision that you're potentially making, I guess, to accelerate the rollout. So what are you seeing today in the most recent rollouts versus what you've seen over the first couple that gives you a little bit more confidence? And then the second part of this question is if you did accelerate it, and I know, obviously, there's a lot of variability around the details, but what would that mean to the 2015 guidance that you gave at the Analyst Day?", "William J. DeLaney", "I'll tell you what, I'm going to try to do a better job than Chris, and then I'll let him go back and do this all over again. We -- I think the biggest thing we're seeing is confidence, I mean, to be somewhat qualitative. We -- I mean I think our people are -- we've done a few of these now, right? So we've done 5 now. And each time we do it, both the teams on the deployment side, as well as the local operating teams, the SBS teams, everyone, it's familiar, and it's things we\u2019ve -- we get better each time and so I think confidence coming from improved performance in terms of the deployment aspect of it. In terms of what we need to see, we need to ramp up some resources to be prepared to move at a more accelerated rate. And we need to see really good transition into the operationalizing of the ERP platform as well. So those are all things, as I said and that Chris has alluded to, that we're assessing for over the next several weeks following these last 2 deployments.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, I want to go back. I mean, at Investor Day, we actually talked about the potential to accelerate once we proved a few things and built up our own confidence. We just said we'd be looking for that opportunity. And I think all we\u2019re really pointing out right now is we are now starting to look more seriously at the opportunity to accelerate based upon some early confidence. The impact of that, I obviously can't quote you numbers, but conceptually, the impact of that is we will accelerate expense, obviously, inside of the range that we had previously disclosed, and that would also ultimately accelerate some of the benefits that were post-2015. So if you recall when we talked about the benefits from business transformation, we said there would be additional benefits beyond the 3-year guidance that we were putting up on the slide and on the screen during Investor Day. So this would allow some of that to come into that 3-year period, but we'd also accelerate the expense to get it done.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, that makes sense. And then you did mention the $10 million to $20 million increase in the fuel charges. Is that a gross or net basis because you do have surcharges, I think down on a lot...", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, that's the fuel expense, not the surcharge. I don't really anticipate the surcharge increasing very dramatically, so that's the fuel expense. But ultimately, if the surcharge isn't going to grow, that's going to end up being a net expense as well.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And another question is on inventory. Inventory was up about 11% this quarter. Inflation's lower; you're doing some SKU actualization although I don't know how much of that's in the numbers. But could you maybe just help us understand why inventories is up that much?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, first -- I mean, we are moving more cases or still a significant amount of new cases. We were up 2.9%. Secondly, those acquisitions that we bring online also bring on additional inventory as well. You still have a little bit of inflation in there; it's not nearly as much as before. But every quarter, we \u2013 well, actually every month, we will analyze how much of our increase in inventory was due to sales versus DSOs. And I will tell you, we're still not hitting on all cylinders on the DSOs. We have opportunities for improvement there. But most of our inventory increase was driven by sales growth.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then my last question for you is a little bit more bigger picture related to CapEx. Your CapEx guidance for this year is certainly down relative to last year because there's less spending, I guess, on business transformation. But if you look back over time, you've had years where you were $400 million to $500 million in CapEx. You're still, I think, in the range, if I remember, $600 million, $650 million. Could you maybe just help us understand what the difference is even where you are now versus what that used to be? And is there an opportunity to get CapEx lower in the not-too-distant future?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, it's a topic we've spent quite a bit of time talking about around here. I think the answer is yes, we can bring CapEx down lower. We've taken the first step of that, which is to look historically at some metrics for capital versus sales, for example. We talked about that at Investor Day and what's the right percentage, and I think we outlined 1% to 1.2% of sales. It's not perfect, but it's a good guideline. Step one is to get us back comfortably into that range, and then we'll see where we can go from there. But the answer to the first part of your question is we're a bigger company than we were 4 or 5 years ago. We've got more facilities. We had to -- during the crisis, we didn't spend a lot of capital, so we did some make-up spending afterwards because, frankly, we had built up some pent-up demand, and we needed additional space. So there was some catch-up there. Now we've got those facilities to maintain, we've got additional fleet from all of the case growth that we've realized over the last 4 or 5 years. So we're going to spend more capital to maintain that fixed asset base. But all of us believe that we've got more opportunities for efficiency.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, the only thing I would add is Chris has done a really good job over the last few months of helping us make cash flow and asset optimization, asset management optimization in one of our key areas of strategic focus. We had 3 big facilities that came on board this past year. We have one big facility that's going to come on board in the current year in Southern California. Fleet replacement, those trucks and power units cost more today; significantly more than they did 2 or 3 and even certainly 5 years ago. So there's a fair amount of inflation on the construction side and on the fleet side if you go back and compare what we're doing today versus just a few years ago.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just one quick follow-up, and I'm done here. The cost savings that you guided to for the year, I think, was in this like $150 million range. How much of that did you get in this quarter?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "So your guidance is approximately correct. We said total run rate benefit at the end of 3 years $550 million to $650 million, and we'd realize about 25% of that in the first year so your math certainly holds up. We believe we're on track for that. We're not really going to give quarterly guidance as to what we received. We certainly have internal forecast by category of initiative, and we're tracking those very carefully. We're ahead in some areas; we're behind in some areas; we're on track in other areas. But all in, we're feeling pretty good about the number for this year, and that's why we've not changed our forecast for that.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Greg Badishkanian of Citi.", "Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "This is Alvin Concepcion in for Greg. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the slowdown in the restaurant industry trends throughout the quarter and early part of the second quarter. Is there a major difference you're seeing out there between casual dining chain customers and independents? And also, is there any color that you're hearing from your customers on the sales environment? Are they increasingly more concerned and are they making some adjustments to pricing as a result?", "William J. DeLaney", "Let me take the first one and if I forget get the second one, let's come back to that. I'll tell you what; can you just give me the first one again? I want to make sure I answer it right.", "Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Sure. Are you seeing any major differences out there between casual dining chain customers and the independents?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, first of all, I guess the way we look at it, there's a lot of independents that are casual dining restaurants. Relative to chains, I'd say actually the data we're seeing right now is that there's been some growth with independents, modest. It's comparable to the chain growth right now after a couple of years of where independents have been flat to down and chains have been flat to up. So from that standpoint, that might be a promising sign. We're seeing the same data you all see. Sometimes, we're reading your data. I think overall, there is still very, very modest growth there, but the trends have softened, and it's not what it was a few months ago. Most of the growth seems to be on the quick-serve side and the casuals are holding their own. Upscale is up a little bit, but I still think that might be off of a relatively easy comparison. The only other color is I think traffic has softened some, but the price of the check, so to speak, is -- continues to grow modestly. So we still think there's some very modest growth there; it's not just at the rate of what we saw here just a few months ago. And again, we're splitting hairs here. It's not like it was robust growth a few months ago. So I just want to reiterate our point. We feel like we're doing a good job being responsive and proactive in those areas. We cover all segments of the restaurant industry. But again, we also have a strong presence in the nonrestaurant side of the foodservice industry, and we're doing a really nice job there as well.", "Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That's great color. And I apologize if I missed this, but in regards to the sequential improvement in the gross margin, I'm assuming moderating inflation was a contributor to that. Did you also see improvements in the competitive pressures in the quarter relative to last quarter?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think, clearly, the moderating of inflation was a big part of that. And we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter. I think inflation came down into the 3s, and then this quarter in the 2s. So there's -- as I've explained before, I don't want to sound too esoteric or too passive here. There's certain amount of math in the relationship between inflation and gross margin. So yes, we've benefited from that. But our margins were still down 0.3 of a point, and so a little bit of that, I think, was customer mix, where our contract customers have grown a little faster than our street customers right now. We did see our brand grow, which is encouraging; that's a good thing on margins. So, yes, the competitive pricing environment remains very acute. But at this point, this is really on us to find ways to continue to strike the right balance between growing our business with our customers and still driving out the right type of gross profit dollar growth.", "Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And did you see any changes in the environment into October?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I would say it softened further in October.", "Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "With competitive pressures, I'm talking about.", "William J. DeLaney", "That's almost impossible to gauge on a monthly basis.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Bill, if you can give us what your buyers are saying about inflation right now and how are you feeling about the center-of-the plate proteins in particular given the drought we had this year?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think it's mixed. I believe we saw a fair amount of inflation in poultry this quarter, and meat's a big category for us, Mark, so I think that was 5% or 6%. So it's hard to get a great handle on where that goes from here, but I would expect that to stay up. Seafood, not as much. Dairy, on the other hand, we saw a meaningful deflation there in dairy and dairy, and a little bit in produce as well deflation. So actually, dairy and produce are probably 2 of your most volatile categories, and so they'll go back and forth. So right now, I would say it hasn't changed a lot from what we're showing here for the quarter. And I wouldn't expect it to change dramatically in the next few weeks or month or 2. But also, we're watching it really close because, obviously, there's other fundamentals out there in terms of the drought that we experienced throughout summer and what that may mean second half of the year in terms of both products and livestock and all that type of thing. So bottom line is it's in a good place for us and our customers right now. I do think there are some pressures building that over the second part of the year we could see a pickup again.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just to follow up a little bit on your last comments there on the gross margins getting a little better here as the quarter progressed. Is that because your efforts to manage inflation were a little better, or that you backed off of some of your planned discounting? Where do you think the improvement came from?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, I think we managed it somewhat better, but we're still not managing as well as we need to. I'm just being straight with you there. But I also think, like I said, just the math of inflation, when your costs are only going up 2%, it's not as difficult to manage the pricing off of that than when they're going up 7% or 8% in some categories.", "Operator", "And up next is John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones, I think. You mentioned, Bill, in your prepared remarks something that Sysco was doing that was driving up the cost of delivery in the quarter, maybe -- I don't know if it was a mistake that you made, or maybe there were some initiatives. I mean -- I guess what were those? And are those now solved for the current quarter?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, let me balance this a little bit, John. What I said is I felt we did a really good job on the SG&A side. And unfortunately -- and we lowered our cost per case there, which is a key metric for us. And to just have flat cost per case in this business is pretty hard to do, so we were pleased with what we did there. We gave a lot of it back on the delivery side. Some of that was fuel; some of it was some labor shortages in markets that are particularly robust right now, and where some of the oil is being drilled and energy and that type of thing. So I'm sure we saw the benefit of that on the sales and gross profit line. And there's just some things we didn't execute as well as could have in several markets, and I\u2019ll leave that in-house, if you're okay with that. And look, we're running a business here, and I wish on a given day or a given quarter, we could execute with perfection, and we did a lot of things well here, I would say, to characterize this quarter. I would've liked to see us perform a little better on the gross profit line and manage our delivery expenses a little more consistently across the company, and we're working on both of those.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, understood. And then secondly, I mean, obviously, you're outperforming the broad foodservice distribution industry as would be evidenced by restaurant sales that -- and especially in casual dining is actually seeing shrinking traffic. So -- I mean, what is your sense that -- where is your share coming from at this point? I mean, is it coming from some of the larger competitors, or is it the very fragmented industry that you see out there that may finally see some forced consolidation as traffic remains weak and fuel costs goes up for operators that already have extremely low margins?", "William J. DeLaney", "Great question; hard to answer since we don't see the other guys' numbers. But my best judgment is that more of it is coming from the smaller, more fragmented part of the competitive landscape and that the larger players are probably holding their own or maybe picking up a little share.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I mean, obviously, we've been talking a lot about acquisitions, but I mean are you beginning to see at the local level some consolidation of the smaller operators? Is there kind of some supply that's quietly coming out that we wouldn\u2019t necessarily see here?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I think we are, and that's what we alluded to in comments on the acquisition environment being somewhat better. The challenge for you guys it's there's thousands of them, so it's hard for you to see it in terms of how our numbers roll up or the industry numbers. But the acquisition pipeline we're talking about is more in that middle to lower end of the competitive food chain, so to speak.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ajay Jain of Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "My main questions were already asked earlier, but I wanted to just get some clarification on whether the severance costs this latest quarter are related to the cost reduction activities that were already contemplated for the year so even to the extent that your anticipated cost savings are at least somewhat headcount-driven, I'm just wondering if the severance represents some upfront investment in terms of the cost reduction goals or if it's totally outside the scope of the planned cost reduction activities that you talked about at your Analyst Day?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Ajay, this is Chris, and you nailed it. It is related to the initiatives, primarily related to the IT initiative that I talked about so there was a fairly large chunk of it this quarter. We'll probably have some more of it in Q2. But it's an upfront investment to get to the run rate savings.", "Operator", "Up next is Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Looking at the segment numbers sales, could you talk about just SYGMA, why it slowed? Was that what's going on with those customers or did you anniversary some business?", "William J. DeLaney", "We anniversaried some business, I've never used that term before, but I like that one, Andy. So we've had pretty good growth in the segment the last couple of years, and the key there generally is picking up a new customer and, obviously, not losing any big ones. So we haven't picked up a large new customer here over the last year. And we've lost a little business; some of that we wanted lose and some of it, not so much. Bottom line is SYGMA is going to be a little more volatile compared to the Broadline in terms of ups and downs.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And with -- we don't see the inflation number by segment. But when I look at SYGMA going down and much more than sequentially in terms of sales growth in Broadline. Does -- what can we -- can you tell us if Broadline case movement was actually -- I'm sure it was better than the combined number, but was it a lot better; was it flattish sequentially or versus down the way it was for the combined 2 segments?", "William J. DeLaney", "I want to be careful here, Andy, because you know a lot of our people listen to these calls, and we're working hard at kind of this One Sysco mentality here. But when you look at our numbers, as the Broadline goes is how the company goes. So there's never going to be much of a difference between the Broadline numbers and the overall numbers, and there wasn't in this case either.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Fair enough. Okay. And my last question is on business transformation. Kind of simply put, what are the things you're seeing that are -- have the executive -- your folks contemplating accelerating it; what's working?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, we had a similar question earlier. I'll give you my best shot at that and let Chris jump in here.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Maybe I can help.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, Chris can help me this time. Seriously, look, we've obviously had some bumps along the way here, but we've done 5 of these now. We've continued to bring in folks to strengthen our team at all levels, and we're getting better at all parts of it, the prep work, the programming, the change management work, the training. And as a result, each rollout on these conversion weekends has been a little bit better. East Texas went very well. We've had good results business-wise since then. And so as you see that, people gain confidence, we gain confidence, and so that's the first step, is to make sure that you can handle the conversion right, get the deployment right and begin to hand it off to the business in a way that they run with it. And -- but you can't wait until you're year end to it to kind of have these thoughts. So where we're at right now is evaluating the opportunity to accelerate as we get more comfortable that we're executing at a level that's appropriate, and that we can mobilize the resources that it\u2019s going to take to do that. Chris?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, I think about this in 2 different components. There's the confidence level on being able to roll it out, so the actual implementation and then there's how does it work after the fact. And while those are tied together in our minds, they are kind of distinct parts of the equation. We're definitely focused in this particular answer to this question on the first part of this, which is, are we gaining more confidence in being able to roll it out? So I spent the weekend in North Texas during their rollout last weekend. And when you're actually sitting there watching the large number of people roll this thing out and implement it and it goes incredibly smooth, and yes, there are issues that come up right and left, but the team have gotten so adept at handling the issues. And frankly, they're smaller issues than we were seeing in the other ones, that just gives you more confidence that we know how to roll this thing out. And at the same time, we were doing it in another operating company at the same time. First time we've tried that. That gives you more confidence that we're going to be able to roll this thing out a little bit faster. Now we still have to get through a couple other hurdles to make sure that we're going to be ready to do that, and that's the work that we're beginning now. But I'd say that's more color on the whole confidence notion, and that's what's causing us to, at least, look at what it would take to go faster.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And on the second -- that's sort of where I was -- that answer was very clarifying. So the second way you look at it, the benefits, is there any -- is there enough data for you internally to also feel that more confidence about that, or is it really just more about the first part, the execution of the rollout?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Well, if you remember some of our previous conversations around the benefits, we were only looking at the hard dollar benefits, which primarily are driven by reduction in staff and headcount out in the field as we roll these things out. So as we go back and we look at what was our pre-rollout headcount, what did we anticipate getting to after the rollout by a certain amount of time? We're getting close to our targets there. And the first 3 being pilots and the second 2 -- or the first 2 being pilots; and then East Texas and the second 2 just having gone, it's a little early to get a complete read on that, but we are getting the headcount reduction benefits that we had anticipated getting in almost all areas. And the exceptions, frankly, are areas where as we went through the process, we decided that we might have been a little aggressive and -- in our initial estimations and we've pushed back a little bit since that time. So it's too early to read everything. We're not going to quote a bunch of numbers, but we're feeling pretty good about at least the hard dollar savings that we talked about publicly.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, Andy, I'd just take a moment here to remind everyone that a lot of what we talked about in May and what we've shared since then is because we have had some delays here, we are finding other ways to accelerate these benefits. We're not waiting to deploy this thing in 70 U.S. companies and then Canada to get the benefits as we originally designed them in the business case. So when we talk about improvement in SG&A and when you look at that roadmap to 2015 that we put out there in SG&A and operations, some of those benefits were part of the original case, and we're going to drive those out now, and muscle through them where we need to. And then to Chris' point, there'll certainly be some additional benefits as we deploy and we're able to become more efficient post-deployment. But there's 2 paths right now: One is the deployment path, and the other is muscling through these cost savings even without the system.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we turn next to Meredith Adler of Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to talk a little bit, go back to the subject of inflation. And maybe just talk a little bit about what you're working on. I think you talked about some systems that would help pass along and were priced better, and I'm sure that relates to inflation. So maybe talk about where you feel you haven't done as good a job and how you see that improving and how quickly can it improve.", "William J. DeLaney", "Okay, I'm not sure what we've talked about in terms of pricing and in inflation, but what I try to share with you, Meredith, is as we've said very consistently for as long as I can remember, if we could keep inflation in this 2% to 3% zone that we've had the last couple of quarters, and if it was relatively comparable across all categories, that's just a much better environment for our customers and, therefore, it's a much better environment for us. People can handle modest increases. Maybe not as easily as I could 3 or 5 years ago before some of the challenges in the economy and the marketplace, but certainly better than they can a 5%, 6% to 7% increase. We have pretty good systems today. I want to be really clear. We have good systems today on how to manage inflation. And from that standpoint, I think we do a decent job with it. I think the art to this thing right now is to, again, strike the right balance as we manage the business at that district level, at the OpCo level and then even here on how we interact with large customers and suppliers. How do we strike the right balance between profitable growth and pricing? And so along the way, we have certainly explored some different systems and scientific pricing modules, and we continue to assess those. And I think we will get better in that arena over time. And we certainly can see analytically that there's probably an opportunity to have less variability in our pricing. And we'll continue to work on those opportunities. But I would say to you, for now, it's kind of good old-fashioned management on our part and attention to detail and striking that proper balance between growth and profitability.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So I guess when you have said, you did say it on this call about could've done a better job in terms -- you're talking about finding a good balance between profitable growth and pricing when you say could've done a better job?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I'm just saying we, as a management team throughout Sysco, I think could've done a better job. We did better than we did last quarter, and we certainly did better than we did a year ago from a trend standpoint. But what I'm really trying to say is we see opportunity out there where we could perform even better, and that's what we're working on internally.", "Operator", "And we have time for one final question today, and we'll go to Erin Lash of Morningstar.", "Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "You commented that the acquisition environment was very favorable. I wonder -- I was wondering if you could touch on whether there were any differences that you're seeing between the acquisition environment in the U.S. versus internationally?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Well, to the extent that in the U.S. we mentioned the kind of tax rush, if you will, to get some of these transactions done by the end of the year, that does not necessarily apply to foreign acquisitions unless that their ownership may be U.S.-based. So we're not seeing, I'll say, quite as many. The markets are -- just talking about Ireland, there aren't as many players in Ireland. We tend to know who they are, and I think these were very targeted, strategic transactions for us to broaden our appeal to the customer base there and also broaden our network. So we've kind of picked what we wanted there, I guess, if we could say, and done it strategically. Canada, we spoke a lot about or at least I talked about our strategic desires in and around Qu\u00e9bec, Montr\u00e9al. And so again, I think the team was very thoughtful up there about which acquisitions we wanted to go after. But in terms of the pipeline, we've got stuff coming to us, I'd say, in all 3 markets, and we look at it, we evaluate it, we first decide whether it makes strategic sense and we start looking at whether the valuations are going to make sense to both us and the sellers and see if we can get a deal done.", "Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then just finally, I was wondering if you could provide just a little bit more detail. You alluded to the execution issues that you're facing. I was wondering if those were in markets where you've already rolled out business transformation, or in markets that haven't been touched by those efforts yet.", "William J. DeLaney", "Erin, it\u2019s Bill. No, they were just -- I'm just trying to give you all some color. When you look over our business and you're talking about roughly 70 operating companies in the U.S. and another 10 or 12 large companies in Canada plus Ireland, the beauty of this business is there's always things that we're doing well and we can do even better. And then there's always going to be situations where we're not doing and performing quite as well as we would like. So the point is, is I can tell you without, from where I sit and where our management team sits, that there are several markets where we probably could have managed the operations side of the business a little bit better, and we will. And we're very focused on that. And so I share that with you basically to be candid, but also to illustrate the nature of the business, that it's one of continuous improvement. With that said, we did a nice job on the SG&A side. And so from the standpoint of looking at it overall, that's why you saw in my prepared comments from an overall expense management standpoint, the expenses in the core business grew about 3%. That's pretty good. We think we can do as well as that or better going forward.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to the management team for any final comments.", "Neil A. Russell", "Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Have a good day.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's presentation.

DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.8 billion for the second quarter and net earnings of $221 million. Earnings per share was $0.38 and adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business performance, was $0.49 or 4.3% increase year-over-year.", "During the quarter, solid case volume growth contributed the highest second quarter sales level in our history. This growth was driven by both acquisition and organic growth as we were particularly successful in growing with our large regional and national customers.", "Adjusted operating income grew nearly 5% for the quarter. Gross margin trends improved for the third consecutive quarter but were lower than the prior year due in part to the change in customer mix I just noted. We were especially pleased with our expense control performance in the selling and administrative areas of our business, as we benefited from successful implementation of several strategic initiatives. However, managing our expenses on the operating side of the business was challenging, as fuel and payroll costs grew at a faster rate than our productivity improvements.", "To date, in fiscal year 2013, we have completed 10 acquisitions representing approximately $775 million in annualized revenue and expanding our presence in the United States, Canada and Ireland. The acquisition environment remains favorable, and we continue to have a number of additional opportunities in the pipeline. Our core market potential approximates $235 billion and grew by about 1% in real terms in calendar year 2012. Based on preliminary industry data, we believe we grew our market share this past year at a rate consistent with our strong historical performance. However, consumer sentiment and restaurant traffic trends have softened of late due to ongoing economic pressures, reinforcing the need for Sysco to aggressively transform our business so that we remain well positioned to provide greater value to our customers and reduce our overall cost pressure.", "Two critical components to deepening our customer relationships are more effectively marketing the Sysco brand and gaining greater insight into our customer's value and how we can most effectively address those needs. We are making good progress in both of these areas under the leadership of Bill Goetz, Senior Vice President of Marketing, who joined Sysco about a year ago. One development that we are very excited about is our recently announced marketing relationship with the Food Network, its highly rated show Restaurant: Impossible and its chef, Robert Irvine. This is a first for Sysco, and we believe it will enhance our brand, strengthen our relationships with existing customers and extend our reach to new customers. This multi-platform relationship will include TV commercials and show product integration, digital integration and personal appearances by Chef Irvine.", "Turning to the technology appointment portion of our multi-year business transformation efforts, we are making progress at our operating companies in North Texas and West Texas, where we deployed our new ERP system in November. Particularly encouraging has been the improved functionality of the order entry system compared to earlier rollouts. In addition, our shared business service center, SBS, continues to ramp up to support a broader array of administrative functions in a centralized manner. We have encountered some challenges, however, in the recent rollouts and are in the process of proceeding to make additional changes to further enhance the functionality of the system. We are confident that we will be able to resolve these matters as we move forward, and we'll refine our deployment rollout schedule accordingly. At the same time, we continue to move forward with other aspects of transforming our business.", "In closing, I would like to thank all of our customers for their support as we move through our business transformation journey. I would also like to recognize all of our associates for their ongoing dedication and commitment to Sysco's success, especially those that put forth tremendous effort to service our customers in the midst of Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath. The transformational change that we are currently navigating throughout Sysco is both extraordinary and foundational to our profitable growth in the years to come.", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $10.8 billion or an increase of 5.4% compared to the prior year, driven by a case volume growth of 2.8% and food cost inflation of 2.5%. In addition, acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 1.1%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 0.3%.", "Gross profit in the second quarter increased 3.9%. Gross margin in the second quarter declined 26 basis points. Roughly 1/2 of this decline was caused by a slight shift in customer mix as a result of growth in large regional and national customers. The remainder of the decline can be attributed to continued competitive pressure and a difficult sales environment that softened further during the quarter.", "Operating expenses increased $116 million or 8.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior-year period, driven mainly by a $45 million increase in business transformation expenses and a $17 million increase in salaries and related costs. In addition, during the second quarter, we recognized $22 million in charges from certain items related mainly to severance from the restructuring of our IT function, which we discussed last quarter and the restructuring of our executive retirement plan, which we discussed in the 8-K we filed on January 16. As a result of all of these items, operating income decreased $44 million or 10.4%.", "Net earnings for the second quarter were $221 million, a decrease of $29 million or 11.5% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.38, an 11.6% decrease compared to the prior year.", "As you know, Hurricane Sandy had a devastating impact on a large part of the country during the second quarter. We have been deeply saddened by the tremendous personal and professional toll it has taken on our customers and the communities we serve. Our operations and crisis management team did a tremendous job protecting our assets before the storm and in helping our customers recover afterwards. In addition, as in many natural disaster events, Sysco played a key role in ensuring first responders can serve the community. While we avoided substantial asset losses, we estimate that the storm and its aftermath cost us about $0.01 a share during the quarter.", "As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes the $22 million in certain items I just mentioned, but also excludes business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business as we go through our business transformation: adjusted operating expenses increased 3.7%, slightly lower than the growth in gross profit dollars; adjusted operating income increased 4.6%; adjusted net earnings grew 4.7%; and adjusted EPS grew 4.3% to $0.49 per share.", "As Bill mentioned, the acquisition environment is currently quite favorable, and we have been very active in this area. To date, in fiscal 2013, we have completed 10 acquisitions with annualized revenues totaling approximately $775 million. As a result, we have already exceeded our goal of adding 0.5% to 1% in sales from acquisitions this fiscal year, and we still have a number of additional potential transactions in the pipeline that we are working to complete over the next several quarters.", "Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment, in the second quarter, project expenses totaled $81 million, and we capitalized $3 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, project expenses totaled $36 million, and we capitalized $33 million related to the project. We continue to make progress on our other key business transformation initiatives. With regard to our initiatives to reduce our operating costs, we have completed the implementation of the SAP maintenance module throughout our U.S. Broadline Companies, and we have also created specific action plans for every OpCo to implement best practices in warehousing and delivery.", "On our initiatives to reduce our SG&A cost, we have completed the rollout of our sales productivity initiatives, including the deployment of our new CRM tools throughout our U.S. Broadline operating companies; we've implemented substantial changes on our IT function, outsourcing our managed services work; we have begun to implement the SAP Human Resources module throughout our operating companies; we restructured the retirement benefit plans for associates and executives; and we have begun the process of centralizing some of our field finance work to our shared services center.", "And finally, with regard for initiatives to reduce our product costs, we have progressed our 4 pilot categories through the category management process to the point where we are now awarding new contracts to suppliers. Even though there is a lot of hard work left ahead of us, we are pleased with our overall progress today on our key transformation initiatives.", "Turning to our cash flow performance, at our Investor Day last year, we discussed our plans to reduce capital expenditures in both our underlying business, as well as for the Business Transformation Project. We've made good progress on that objective, with CapEx declining $172 million in the first half of this year compared to last year. We've seen a decline in capital spending related to the Business Transformation Project, mainly driven by the fact that we began implementation of the new technology earlier this year. In the underlying business, we've seen lower capital spending because of a reduction in the number of major facilities project this year compared to last, and a more disciplined capital allocation and approval process.", "As a result of the reduction in capital spending, free cash flow increased 20% year-over-year to $125 million. We expect the effect of continued lower capital spending this year, combined with the completion of the IRS payment last year, will result in an improvement in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. The other component of the free cash flow equation, cash flow from operations declined year-over-year in the first half by $152 million or 28%. Increased inventory levels drove about 1/2 of this decline. We also had an increase in certain current period tax payments mainly due to timing.", "Before I close, I want to remind you of guidance we have provided previously on a few significant items that will impact the second half of the fiscal year, 2 of which we discussed in more detail in our 8-K filed in January. We believe our transformation initiatives will provide meaningful long-term benefits to Sysco. However, as we discussed at our Investor Day, some of the initiatives will result in onetime charges. I discussed a few minutes ago a $12 million charge we incurred in the second quarter related to the restructuring of our executive retirement plans. The total charges are estimated to be $24 million, and we expect to incur the remaining $12 million in charges related to this action in the second half of the year. This restructuring more closely aligns the executive retirement plan with the employee retirement plan. And we believe over the long term, will reduce the volatility retirement-related expenses, as well as the total cost of retirement-related expenses.", "On our fiscal 2012 year-end call last August, we discussed the more than $100 million potential increase in pension expense we were facing as we were developing our fiscal 2013 plan. In response to this potential significant increase in expense, we restructured our employee retirement plans to freeze our defined benefit pension plan and subsequently enhance our defined contribution or 401(k) plan. As I mentioned a few moments ago, during the second quarter, we recently completed the restructuring of our retirement plans by also restructuring our executive retirement plans. The net effect of all these changes is that we now expect pension expense to be lower in fiscal 2013 by $21 million, with $15 million of this decrease occurring in the second half of fiscal 2013. The additional expense in fiscal 2013 related to the increase in 401(k) and other retirement plan changes will be in the range of $55 million to $65 million, all of which will impact the second half of this fiscal year. These 2 components together will result in a net increase in retirement-related expenses for the full year of between $35 million and $45 million. This includes amount that we categorize as certain items.", "Finally, in the third quarter, we expect to incur a $40 million charge related to the withdrawal from an underfunded multi-employer pension plan. This withdrawal will help us mitigate our exposure to multi-employer pension plans and underfunded status.", "In closing, fiscal year 2013 is a critical year for us as we work towards significant milestones in our business transformation plan and begin to realize benefits from several areas of our company. The work we are doing will favorably position us to take advantage of opportunities to continue to grow our market share and expand upon our leadership position in the industry.", "With that operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of things. Is there any update on either the rollout schedule, where you expect to be by fiscal year end in terms of OpCos or the benefit because I think it's 25% of the ultimate benefit would be seen this year. Is there any update on either one of those?", "William J. DeLaney", "John, no, I don't have an update for you this morning. What we're telling you, I think, in our prepared comments is we're in somewhat of a delay here from what we originally anticipated in terms of rollouts, and we're going to take the next few weeks to continue to assess the things we need to improve in terms of the functionality of the system. I think over the next month or 2, we should have an update on the rollout time line. As far as the 25% of the benefits, I want to just keep reminding everybody, and I'll let Chris speak to this because he's the one that's really managing this pretty well, that is off of a overall targeted savings of $600 million give or take over a 3-year period, which incorporates, not just the technology side of it, but some big initiatives we have going on, which Chris referenced in detail here today on the SG&A side of the business as well as the product cost side of the business. So I think we're in a good -- pretty good place there. And I'll let Chris provide some color for you.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, John, with regard to both parts of your question on the rollout plan, I won't add any color to what Bill said other than the guidance that we have out there right now is 5 to 15 operating companies being converted this year. I think it's fair to say we're going to be at the lower end of that range, but as Bill said, we're working through whatever revisions we might need to make to our plans right now. But that's the current guidance. On the savings, again as Bill said, it's across all of our business transformation initiatives. I kind of walked you through where we made progress on many of the others and frankly, we feel pretty good about where we are on our overall cost saving initiatives for this year, as well as going forward.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So just as a follow-up on, I guess, ERP, 2 key things, the functionality challenges are coming primarily where? And then as you've rolled out the CRM component, have you seen yet much of a benefit to how the salespeople are doing their day-to-day job, whether it's calling on more customers or anything like that or is that too early yet?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think we're beginning to see benefits, John, on the CRM. But it is pretty early. I mean, we've -- it's a huge rollout for us in multiple companies. But for us to be able to successfully implement some of the other initiatives in the SG&A side that we've undertaken, we're going to need to see effective implementations of CRM. So I think we're in a good place there. But that's like a lot of things. It probably takes a good year to get it out and get people to use the system and to trust it and then to hold each other accountable for results. So I'd say still early, but we're very encouraged and very pleased with the system itself that we're using. As far as the functionality, let me do this. I went back and I looked at some things we've said to you all in recent calls and I'd like to put it in context. And I think the first point I want to leave with you is we're very confident in the direction we're going in here. We're very confident that we are going to be able to resolve some of the challenges that we have right now. We're just not as confident in terms of the specifics of the near-term time line. With that said, what we've talked about in the past is concerns, issues with speed, performance, in particular with the order entry system. We had some issues with reports early on, and we spoke a little bit in the past about inventory management service levels, those types of things. I would say to you where we are today with these recent rollouts, we're pleased with the progress we've made on the order entry and the speed and the performance of that system. So we've done well there. We're very pleased with, as I said earlier, with the ramp up of SBS, and that group beginning to take on a broader array of support services, even without the technology being as further -- as far along as it will be at some point. So we're not waiting on the technology to begin to centralize the things that we believe that can be centralized effectively. Our challenges today, we've had some hardware blips, to be honest with you, around Thanksgiving time. We ran into some issues there and it took us a while to resolve that. We've had an event or 2 here of late as well. So we still got some things to work through on the hardware side, highly confident that we will be able to do that. And then on the, well, I'll call it again, the inventory management service level issues, still not clicking here at the level that we need to be. We came out of the chute pretty well after the deployments themselves, but the service levels aren't where they need to be. We've ran into some issues with connectivity and our system to our large customer systems. And those are things that we're working through today. Now I'll remind you that this deployment, we did back in early November, was very important for a couple of reasons: one, it's the first time we deployed 2 companies; but second, North Texas or -- essentially Dallas is by far and away the largest OpCo we put on the system, and it's one of our largest Opcos overall. So these challenges we're going into right now, well, some were frustrating at times, not unexpected, and we're working through them with our customers and with our people and again, really appreciate the patience of the customers and very, very appreciative of the efforts our people are putting forth.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then just one last thing, it looks like the level of price investments have moderated from where they were 9 months ago, a year ago. Is that likely to continue, or does that go the other way, given the macro and maybe a resurgence in inflation? Do you think the pace of price investments gets more intense on your end the next remainder of this year or do you continue -- think we continue to moderate?", "William J. DeLaney", "John, those are your words. I don't think I've used those words exactly. I will say about 1.5 years, 2 years ago, we did talk a lot about strategic pricing initiatives and there were some things we are doing there, a category or 2, that we have pretty much cycled through, and we're pleased with what we've seen there in terms of growth. I think the relative improvement you're seeing on the margin trends is a combination of 2 things. I mean we are working very hard at it, trying to strike the right balance in terms of growth and being responsive to our customers. And secondly, is because the inflation has subsided that takes a little pressure off the percentage change issue there. So we're continuing to try to grow the business aggressively but be smart about it, and we need to continue to improve on the margin side.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Edward Kelly with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So if we could go back to -- just a quick follow-up on the ERP implementation. Is there any impact on the cost that you expected to incur this year, the $300 million, $350 million, as well as on capital because I know you talked about some hardware issues.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "The second one first. At this point, we don't really anticipate an increase in the cost of capital. And if it is, frankly, it's going to be minor. Hardware really doesn't cost that much in the grand scheme of a project like this. The capitalization of labor, which typically occurs when you're developing a system, not when you're implementing it. So I don't anticipate a significant increase in the capitalization. In terms of the overall cost, to the extent that there's a delay here, just like what we talked about the last time when we talked about the more significant delay, it's not really in the current year, it's just that additional time down the road. So while there may be some additional costs, I don't currently anticipate those being significant. But anytime you have a delay, of course, you're adding more time to the end of the deployment cycle, and you'll pick up additional cost for a longer period of time.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then I'm just trying to frame sort of like the net cost of business transformation, as well as the cost savings that you talked about this year. And, I guess, the way we think about it, if there's $300 million to $350 million in business transformation, and let's call it, roughly $150 million in cost saves, you're sort of at this $175 million level net for the full year, which is lower year-over-year than last year, right, because you gross cost in those savings. Are we thinking about that the correct way?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "You're generally correct. We gave you a lot of guidance at our Investor Day, which I'd encourage you to pull back up, there are a couple of charts there that are pretty good. That, frankly, if you listen to our calls we try to talk in the same language as those charts every time so you can keep up. But that's how we outlined it. We just had gross business transformation cost. We netted against that, some benefits from our shared services center to get to a net business transformation cost and then we also broke it down into cash cost, and cash is where we expected to pick up some benefit this year as we slowed down the implementation and started depreciation --  sorry, slowed down development and started depreciation.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Now on the cost savings side, I know in the first quarter you were reluctant to, really, kind of give any color on where you stood. I don't know if you could help us understand how much you've achieved today in the first half or how much of that is back half weighted, just as kind of how we think about the model here.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, we're pretty -- we're going to be very cautious about giving quarter-by-quarter guidance because there's going to be a lot of timing elements to this, to be real candid with you. But look, I'm not going to dodge the fact that this whole thing was a build up from one quarter to the next all the way through 3 years. So we told you 25% in the first year, 50-ish range, around 50-ish in the second year and all of it by the third. So you can see the ramp-up. Throughout the year, they ramped up as well. So if the 25% -- yes, more than 1/2 of it is going to be the latter half of the year.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, Bill, could you maybe talk about just general consumer and industry trends? Maybe start with sort of volume growth, what was the cadence to that volume growth throughout the quarter? And then it sounds like things have weakened up so far in the current quarter, volume standpoint. I don't want to put words in your mouth, so if you could just help us understand what you were sort of referring to there.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, sure. I would say to you that the volume trends have softened, I think, as we went through the second quarter, in particular on the street. We're doing a really nice job with the large regional national chains that -- Kent Humphries and his group have brought in some great accounts there. We've been able to grow with some big existing customers so that's been a real positive for us. I would say on the street, we have seen some softness. And then when Hurricane Sandy came, that just exacerbated it. And things picked up after that, but not to the level that we were at before. I'm not really putting that on the hurricane, though. I just think as you read all the things that come out in terms of economics confidence and you look at some things coming out of our industry in terms of the operators and just looking at a lot of the things that you guys publish in terms of restaurant trends, I think you can say that things have softened out there and we're dealing with it. And bottom line is we're continuing to find ways to stay close to our customers, work even harder on retaining the business that we do have and going after new prospects that are good fit for Sysco. So I think it's going to be soft here for a while from everything I read and that just means that we need to work a little bit harder and continue to, as I mentioned in my comments, continue to aggressively go forward on some of the transformation initiatives and continue to develop that acquisition pipeline.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And i just want to ask you one last question on gross profit dollar growth. Your gross profit dollar growth exceeded your case growth this quarter for the first time in a while. Just probably an encouraging sign. Could you maybe talk about what the drivers of that were? It might be something [indiscernible] at SYGMA, but SYGMA didn't grow much. And then how sustainable that is in the back half?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, to be candid, that's not exactly a high bar. But it's -- we need to at least get to that and we -- fortunately, we did. So it is encouraging. And again, I would attribute that to some modest improvement on our part in terms of managing growth and profitability, and we need to continue to improve it or to be totally candid. So it's encouraging but a lot of room to go.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Can you keep that up in the back half, though, do you think?", "William J. DeLaney", "We're planning to.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just first off, a quick one on the recent delays on the ERP rollouts. Do you expect the delay to be measured in months or quarters?", "William J. DeLaney", "Right now I'm dealing with the weeks, Michael. All right, so basically we're -- as I said, we're taking a look at some of the challenges we have, and we've got some very capable people internally and externally working with us on that and we're staying close to our customers. So I think over the next several weeks, we'll have a better update for you on that.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then on the business trends commentary that you've given, anything you can help us with on the trends you're seeing over, let's say, the last 4 or 5 weeks in the current quarter? Are they stable or is there any evidence of an impact from the recent payroll tax increase?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I -- first of all, January's hard for me to make any great commentary on, just there's a lot of volatility from 1 year to the next on weather and that kind of thing. And I don't talk a lot about weather. But keep in mind, this quarter for us, March is disproportionately large because of the seasonal changes where you'll continue to, hopefully, have good business where people go on vacations, as well as people up north getting out a little bit more. So it's hard to draw any conclusions, but generally soft. I will re-announce that. I don't know that I can attribute any of that to the payroll tax. What I would attribute it to is confidence just what the countries going through on the economic side and, I guess, the payroll tax will be a piece of that. And just everybody is, I think, continue to be pretty careful with their dollars as they start the year. But I think our operators I just saw some numbers this morning and these go up and down. And the outlook from our customer base is a little bit better, even though we're not seeing it in the numbers yet. We said this 2 or 3 years ago, and I think, unfortunately, we were right. This recovery is slow and it's uneven. And going back to your earlier question, it seems almost to be quarter-by-quarter at times. So hard to predict, but I think comparisons will be a little tough this quarter again. And I say, one more thing on weather, and I've seen in it -- some of you guys' reports we did have a very mild winter last year and that did help us, in particular, in the northern states. So a little cautious here early in the quarter and certainly hopeful that things will pick up as we get into March.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then on the SYGMA business, I know it's not the biggest chunk of your business, but it was up less than 1% in the quarter despite the 2.5% pricing, which implies that division at least temporarily is actually in decline on a real basis. Is there anything we should be aware of in terms of lost customers or anything like that, or is it just some temporary time shift of some sort of orders, anything like that?", "William J. DeLaney", "It's more the latter. I mean SYGMA's going to have a little bit more volatility on the pipeline because when you bring in a new account or you pick up a significant more business with an existing account that will jump your numbers for a period of time, but we've essentially wrapped some of the new business pickup there and there's been some wins within existing customers and some modest losses, that type of thing. But basically it's a function of we've wrapped some of the new business from a year ago and what you're seeing there is a pretty good reflection of the overall growth of the customer mix.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Can you give us a little comment on what was going on with inflation during the call -- during the quarter, and also your prospective outlook for inflation here for the rest of the year?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, the way we measure it, Mark, I think we said we have about 2.5 points of inflation on our cost. It's pretty stable with most of the categories. Meat was up, I think poultry is up quite a bit, we had some deflation in seafood and the rest of the categories were not overly significant, although some were certainly larger categories than others. So pretty stable from that standpoint. I would expect certainly to see a modest increase over the second half of the year, but I don't know that we've seen enough yet to be projecting more than that. It's just -- we watch it closely, but I guess my best judgment is a modest increase.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Karen Short with BMO Capital.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "A couple of questions just on the OpCos we rolled out -- you've already rolled to. Can you maybe talk to what's happening with volumes, in general, their attention with the customers or anything you can point to that's encouraging?", "William J. DeLaney", "You're talking about the last 2 rollouts, Karen?", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Yes.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I think it's a little early for that, but as I said really on, we did a great job. We had a record sales week in one of the companies at a rollout, and our leadership team and our sales people and our support people here in the 2012 team and SBS have done a great job supporting our sales people and our customers. As you would expect, I mean, as you do run into some of these issues, that will spring some relationships and we've had some good discussions with customers that are experiencing some of the same challenges we are. So they've been very supportive to date, and we are working very hard to get the service levels to the level that we have had historically and that they would expect. So I would say so far, good partnership with the customers but as we've noted, there are some challenges out there.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then in terms of the categories where you've looked at rationalizing SKUs, what about the impact on customers in those categories or on volumes overall in those categories, any color there?", "William J. DeLaney", "I don't think that's had a big impact on customers. It's had an impact internally, but most of the SKUs that we rationalized were, as you would expect, pretty low velocity type SKUs. So anytime you reduce SKUs, it creates some angst and tension in the organization. But Mike Green and his team have done a great job there, and we're down about 10% in our SKUs. So I think the real test there will be as we go further on the category management work, I think Chris mentioned that we're in pilot stage right now. Part of that whole package is to put together a more optimal assortment that's broader but less redundant. And that will create some SKU pressure as well but in the right way. And so our challenge there will be to work through that with our sales force and our customers from a value added perspective. So all in all, I think we've done a good job there and there hadn't been a lot of pushback.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then just last question, looking at your cash flow on the acquisition side of it, the multiple -- if that dollar amount is actually your total payment for the acquisitions that you made, it seems like a pretty attractive multiple of sales. Is there -- are there any deferred payments or anything that will be part of the acquisition price or is that the actual multiple that you paid for those acquisitions?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Typically when we do acquisitions, we will have an earnout agreement, which will last 2 or 3 years, which generally just says that the former management team owners will stay around and help integrate the company and retain as many customers as we possibly can. And for that, if they're able to accomplish that, there's a portion of the purchase price that gets paid out over time. It's not a huge number. So what you're looking at in terms of multiples is fairly reflective of what we're actually paying for these things. We don't typically look at it on a multiple of sales. I know sometimes people do that. There are a lot of different types of businesses that we look at. They have a lot of different operating margins. So that sometimes will cause a pretty broad range if you look at it on a percentage of sales basis.", "Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Right. Unfortunately, that's all I can look at but...", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I understand.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to talk a little bit about what you're doing in terms of retirement expenses. You talked about a pretty big increase in 401(k) expense. Is that because it's a new program, is that kind of an initial expense or will there be continuing -- will that expense continue or will there be incremental higher expenses in the coming years?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes. First, Meredith, we -- I've got to back up and I always have to start with where we would have been this year. We would have been $107 million more in terms of retirement plan expenses, which was obviously not something that we were looking forward to and our shareholders wouldn't have enjoyed either. For that and many other reasons, we look at restructuring our pension plans. That was something we were always looking at as part of business transformation. So we think of it in terms of that was the bogey. We had to do better than that. Now on a year-over-year basis, it is going to be higher, so the direct answer to your question is, yes, within the charges that I've read out earlier, there are some what we call certain items, which are onetime charges that will affect us this year. We talked about $24 million in terms of that, that will hit us this year and then we'll get more to a run rate. We're going to give you more color as to what that run rate is. If not, next quarter certainly in our fourth quarter reports that you can model for next year. We're trying to just give you the visibility for this year. The reason why we all set ranges around it is 401(k) expenses depend upon participation, of course, and that's somewhat hard to predict, especially with employees' paychecks going down because of tax changes. So we've got a fairly wide range in those numbers because we're not sure what the 401(k) benefits are going to look like.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. I think it's great that you froze the defined benefit. It needed it to be done, I'm afraid. I was wondering if you -- I was just wondering if you could talk about the 10 acquisitions you did and whether there is any commonality or anything in particular you're looking for? Are these filling in geographical holes or line of business, or just great opportunities?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "It varies depending on the acquisition. So I'm going to say they're across the board. I'll give you a little color. In Ireland, while we have a very strong business over there and it covers much of the country, we were able to find 2 other companies that together with ours now cover kind of all of the whitespace on the map. We can reach all the way up into Northern Ireland without doing long haul, et cetera. And so that gives us, we believe, coverage over most of the country, not to say we won't look for additional transactions there, but those are great transactions for filling out the map. Canada, we still have a little bit of whitespace left, and predominantly in some of the larger cities, Qu\u00e9bec, Ontario area, there we were underpenetrated and so that gave us the opportunity to increase our penetration or market share in an area where we thought we had plenty of opportunity. Here in the U.S., most of what we're doing now are fill-ins and there are companies that's -- and families that we find that we believe have built a great business and a great name, and we like the way they operate and we enfold them into our companies.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. And then maybe just my final question would be obviously inflation is pretty modest right now. I think there was a time when inflation was a lot higher than when it was just challenging to pass it all along to your customers. Is there any reason to believe that, that's still an issue? I mean 2.5% is kind of on top of big numbers last year, or would you say that this is just -- you're not having any issues passing it along?", "William J. DeLaney", "Meredith, it's Bill. I would say this is as good as it gets, all right? We're in that 2% to 3% zone. That's what we've historically have always signaled is best for our customers and for us. I'm not going to tell you it's easy to pass along, but I think we're doing a little better job of it. It really comes down to the pressure that the foodservice operators are feeling and their outlook. So I think we're doing a decent job right now. If inflation were to pick up materially, that would put pressure on our customers, which ultimately puts pressure on us. So we'd love for it to stay right around here and  maybe tick up a little bit.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, the thing we have to keep reminding ourselves, though, and helping you all with is at the other end of this equation, we still have the problem of consumer demand, the ultimate restaurant patron. They're just not as -- they're not out there as much as they used to be out there. And that's the part that's never really recovered from the Great Recession, if you will. So as long as we have kind of a weak consumer demand and restauranteurs are trying to get as many customers into the restaurants as possible, you're going to have this competitive pressure in the industry. So it's inflation, yes, but it's also just weak demand on the other side.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. And then just one final question about the things you're doing in your shared services facility, it sounds like you've moved a lot of new activities to that facility. Is there anything that you're doing there that perhaps you hadn't originally contemplated and you've now seen an opportunity to use that facility more effectively?", "William J. DeLaney", "I don't know if there's anything we hadn't contemplated. There are things we're accelerating because we're not to the point where we thought we would have been originally on the technology side. So Chris mentioned several of them, HR, finance, we're doing some things in marketing out there. I'll let Chris add to that, but it's more about acceleration, I think.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Absolutely right, Meredith. As we've said and tried to explain a number of times, rather than wait to get the full technology rolled out one OpCo at a time or 6 OpCos at a time or whatever the original plan was and then bring all of those companies into SBS, we've been doing it, frankly, function by function. And we talked about maintenance, that one's done. We're starting to prepare ourselves to receive benefit from that. HR is now being rolled out, finance is underway already. We're just bringing them in function by function, everywhere that we do not need to rely upon the big system going into place. And indeed I think I mentioned and several of these, we're using the SAP modules. We're just turning them on without the overall system being in place. They work just fine coupled in with our existing systems. So it's really about accelerating everywhere we can so that we can get the benefit that we originally described.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Yes, actually most of my questions were already asked, but I just had a question on the payroll increase in Q2 and maybe a lot of this was already covered in the prepared comments from Chris. So I think, Chris, you mentioned that there is going to be an additional $12 million of payroll increase in the back half of the year, but I'm trying to understand the net payroll impact, like, what's been cumulative effect on payroll net of the severance charges year-to-date, and can you give any similar commentary on the outlook for the back half of the year?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I believe we talked about payroll being up $17 million, if I recall correctly, quarter-over-quarter. Let's see if I've got any detail on that, that I can talk about. Yes, $17 million up for the quarter. I don't believe actually that number has any of the onetime charges in it. So what you've got going on in there is we've talked about cost being up on the labor side in our delivery area and costs being down on the SG&A side of the equation. You've got those 2 things kind of playing together and the rest, frankly, are just normal increases in payroll expenses as we move forward.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay, yes. I was just trying to understand the net impact of payroll expense year-to-date and what's your outlook for the balance of the year. But maybe I can follow up off-line.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, look, we can talk about that. I think Bill said in previous comments that we haven't been all that pleased with some of the increases on the delivery side of the equation. We had some overtime issues, some shortage of driver issues, things of that nature. Those costs have been higher than we anticipated. On the other hand, some of our initiatives are kicking in on the SG&A side and specifically the sales side, and those costs are lower. So you get a bit of an offset there. So you're going to have, hopefully, the latter continuing, the initiatives continuing to hold, and we actually start  to gain said benefit or, frankly, just get some control over the delivery side of the equation. So in terms of what we would like the outlook to be, that's it. If this is where we -- we just have to operate really well.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And just as a follow-up, my understanding was that a lot of the cost savings that offset ERP spending, those -- whatever was targeted, I think $150 million for this year, that was supposed to be heavily headcount-related. So if that -- if my assumption is correct, I mean would it be reasonable to infer the payroll expense goes down even open in the back half if you look at the year-over-year comparisons?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, let me take that in 2 parts. Is it reasonable to expect that payroll expense will go down? It will certainly -- it should not go up as much, let me put it to you that way without giving you specific numbers. I want to be careful, though, I don't believe we ever said that the vast majority of the $150 million was going to be headcount-related. You may be confusing that with statements we've always said most of the hard dollar benefits from business transformation or the ERP systems would be headcount-related, which is a different concept. The $150 million fell into various buckets we've described, including product cost reductions, SG&A reductions and lower operating cost reductions. So it's across the board. There's a lot of payroll in it, I'm not trying to dodge that. And so we would expect it, like I said, to at least not continue to increase and hopefully go down a bit. But there are other cost savings in there as well.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I think the only thing I'll add, Ajay, is I mean payroll doesn't have to go down for us to leverage our productivity improvement. And so I would say, yes, I would echo what Chris said, we're not quite where we want to be at this point. There's different things going on in different parts of the business. And we have a very aggressive plan for expenses this year. So if -- I'm not sure you have -- I mean, when you look at the expense growth, it's not bad. I mean if you go back and look at it historically, it's just we have a very aggressive goal, given some of the impact of the initiatives, so I don't know that it has to go down. And I think it needs -- the delta, the increase of the delta, it needs to continue to come off, and that's what we're managing, very much focused on cost per case.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Chris, I heard some of your prepared remarks regarding CapEx control in general and just some increased discipline in general, about how the money is being spent. I mean, have you been able to update kind of fiscal '14, fiscal '15 CapEx guidance? I mean, is it still the intention that those numbers continue to come down as ERP gets finished up?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "We typically update our 5-year capital plan as we go into the end of the year. So we haven't updated future-looking years. I will say this, alleviate maybe one of your concerns, we're not pushing off CapEx this year into next year so that we get a -- gain some benefit this year. I know sometimes you can play with the numbers that way, but we honestly don't feel like we're pushing off just to be making the numbers look better. We're just hitting a little bit, as I said, a little smarter about where we spend our money.", "William J. DeLaney", "I think if you look at last year and this year and pull out the technology and divide it by 2, I think that's a more representative view.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, so we're down $177 million on the capital line. In fact, if you double it, we're going to be well under our guidance. I don't anticipate being well under our guidance, but we're certainly running at the lower end of our guidance right now in terms of our forecast for the year. I just don't have a good view of '14 right now.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then secondly, regarding acquisitions, I mean it seems like kind of your acquisition are being made almost kind of independent of what's going on the ERP side, especially with some of the modest delays that are happening. I mean is that the case or are you just kind of -- are you conscious of the size and the amount of acquisitions that you can make until your legacy system can be running exactly the way that you want it to be?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, so we've talked about $775 million annualized sales across 10 transactions. So just do an average of $75 million sales per transaction. They're not extremely large deals that we would worry about disrupting us. Now that being said, I don't think we would be doing a deal in the middle of Dallas right now and trying to integrate it in Dallas. There's no reason to complicate our lives when we don't need to. So it's a little of both. They're smaller transactions in general, which we feel comfortable taking on regardless of where we are with the ERP. At the same time I think we're thoughtful about where we're going to be trying to integrate deals with our ERP rollout schedule.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Chris, I want to just ask you about Hurricane Sandy, the $0.01 impact you called out, is that all from forgone sales or was there some inventory involved?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "It's a little bit of everything, so we had a little bit of asset loss. We moved as much of our equipment out of the area as we possibly could and literally ran out of storage area for some so we had a little bit of asset loss, some inventory, damage to facilities and then sales loss. In general, what happens is you lose the sales, but you don't necessarily lose the expenses. So you're effectively losing the gross profit on all of that for a period of time. So we measured it as best we can. These are more art than science for the quarter. Some of this impact will last for a while and we're probably going to feel some of the impact when the summer months roll around and some of the businesses that generally will open and thrive during the summer aren't there anymore. But we're starting to see some recovery in the area.", "William J. DeLaney", "But, Andy, I will tell you -- I mean, if you looked at our sales that week, and I don't think I need to tell you in this call the impact of that hurricane, but from the mid-Atlantic right up into Maine and even into the Mideast a little bit, it was dramatic and in particular in metropolitan New York, New Jersey. So that week was obviously devastating to people and our people and customers, but financially, it was a very significant event for that week.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Sure. No, just as we're trying to carve out potential sales impact. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And moving onto M&A, where you helped by the change in the tax code or do you think this -- the M&A environment still remains equally favorable as it was in the quarter?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No. I mean, look, we -- towards the -- we had a very busy December. The teams put in a lot of hours trying to close transactions that needed to be closed by the end of the tax year. So yes, that was the case. At the same time though, I don't think that the pipeline has continued to be rather robust. It's just the number of the deals were desperate to close by the end of the tax year.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And is this environment wearing on potential sellers in terms of valuation expectations -- from what you think, is that -- if we were to take out the tax part of it, what you think of that?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I would say -- I'd characterize where we are currently as more normal, which means you've got sellers that are at least somewhat reasonable. Now, look, in any normal environment, you got some sellers that are being irrational with expectations and some, frankly, that aren't  asking enough for their businesses. So you've got to range. But the range is more, what I would call, traditional and normal than it was, say, 24 months ago. That's what we've been seeing. And that helps us in terms of getting to a \"yes\", with -- on a deal that both sides win at.", "William J. DeLaney", "The biggest thing though, Andy, year in, year out it's still going to be the mindset of that owner, that family or whoever the decision-maker is in terms of how they see their business over the medium term of 3, 5 years, and are they prepared to invest in that is this for the other part of the environment, which is remains pretty tough market out there. So as we've said, I think we're still confident we'll see some activity here going forward.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "And if I could, just a follow-up. I know you've been asked about the SAP a lot, but I just want to check my understanding. Is it the hardware issue you're now having, is that tied directly to the service level issues, or is the service level also go back to the code to the software side of thing?", "William J. DeLaney", "The service level is a result. And what I was trying to say is we have had some hardware issues. And again, we're confident, we're working through them and that we're confident we'll resolve those. But that will create slowdowns in the system, that will create late trucks and that type of things. So we've had some of that. But on top of that, we continue to have challenges as it relates to the functionality of the inventory management system. And that's a separate issue that needs to be addressed separately and -- but they've both result in service level variances from our typical levels.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "And the biggest issue in hardware is, as you might imagine, is just stability. Now if you've got hardware issues, you've got an unstable system, and that's the part that you've got to resolve before you can gain confidence in the system and then as Bill said, everything else kind of drives from that.", "William J. DeLaney", "So what -- I need to be careful here. Let me be clear. We're shipping groceries. The service levels are not at the level that they historically have been at, which is a very, very high level, all right? So the levels are not quite up to our norm. The challenges that we have had, in particular hardware is -- we might have a day or 2 where we have issues with slowness of the system and we have a hard time getting trucks out on time and that creates its kind of issue. The other issue is more of, if you will, steady-state issue that we're working on as well. So we're delivering groceries, it's functioning. We just have very high standards and so do our customers. And that's what we need to continue to perfect here.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Yes. And the other thing, just to take your temperature on this, if I can say it that way, let's say 9 months ago when you had what's, not a similar, but you also had a delay and some challenges. How do you rank this compared to that in terms of your confidence of resolution on getting back on track on a reasonable period of time? How do you felt then? Back then it sounded like it was -- to me, it sounded more serious. I'm just trying to take your temperature on that.", "William J. DeLaney", "I'm actually much more confident than I was 9 months ago in terms of getting back on track and in terms of taking this system to the level it needs to be to scale it and to provide, not just the service to our customers, but the efficiencies that we need and some of these are doing business that our salespeople need. What I'm not as confident on in the short term is the time line. But that's -- those are 2 different questions. So I feel better today. We've got our -- I'm very proud of our people, not only are they working hard, we're making progress, we've brought in some good people internally and externally to help us and each day and each week, even good weeks are challenging weeks. You learn more about it.  So I feel very good about where we're heading. I wish we could give you a little more definitive update on the time line, but I certainly hope we can here over the next several weeks.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Just lastly on sales again because -- I understand the weather is -- are you trying to say for a January status, it's kind of too light? Too light a month to really say there's a change on trend based on to say that the payroll rate or the payroll tax going up or -- is that what you're trying to say or did you, in fact, say maybe things have softened? I'm just trying to get some clarifications.", "William J. DeLaney", "I think I'm trying to say 2 things, Andy. I'll help you work on it.  One is -- the business has slowed, especially on the street, over the last couple of 3 months and that includes January. Two, whether we have a great January or poor January, it's not as material to the quarter as what you see in the second half of the quarter, in particular in March.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Neil A. Russell", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, you will hear from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012, and in the press release issued earlier this morning, which is posted in the Investors section at sysco.com.", "Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in the presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation, which can also be found in the Investors section of our website. All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volume growth include total Broadline and SYGMA combined.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning, Sysco reported sales of $10.9 billion for the third quarter and net earnings of $201 million. Earnings per share was $0.34, and adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business performance, was $0.49 a share, a 2% decrease from the prior year.", "As reflected in these results, the third quarter proved to be very difficult operationally for many of our customers and, as a result, for the vast majority of our operating companies. A number of factors impacted consumers' willingness to spend on food away from home, including higher tax rates, tax refund delays, stubbornly high unemployment, high gas prices and, in some parts of the geographies we service, unfavorable weather conditions.", "Consumers appear to have become increasingly judicious with their disposable income, and it's clear from the decline in restaurant traffic in January and February that going out to eat has not been a high priority of late. While an extended winter has continued to challenge us in certain markets through April, we view most of these trends as cyclical in nature and expect overall market conditions to gradually improve as we move into the remainder of the calendar year.", "In assessing our financial performance for the quarter, let me be clear on one very important point. Although external headwinds created significant pressure on our operations, we did not execute our business plan across the organization as consistently as we should have. We must memorize the unevenness of our operating performance within Sysco, and we will.", "Sales grew 4% for the quarter. While that growth was primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions and pricing, we did experience solid growth with several of our large regional and national customers, especially on the institutional side of the business, by leveraging our broad supply chain capabilities and geographic coverage.", "However, many of our restaurant customers struggled to grow during the quarter for reasons I mentioned earlier. Specifically, sales dollar growth with our street customers, who are largely independent restaurant operators, was soft for the quarter. This group of customers comprises a significant portion of our overall volume and an even greater percentage of our profitability because of the high level of value-added services we typically provide them. Thus, even though we did a fairly good job of managing gross margins at the customer segment level, the impact of customer mix changes contributed to our growing gross profit dollars by only 2% over the prior year.", "Notwithstanding what we believe to be cyclical industry headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to profitably grow our market share over the long term. The key to our future success will be driving our strategic initiatives in conjunction with Sysco's overall business transformation efforts.", "Turning to our multiyear business transformation initiatives. To date, we have completed the rollout of the full SAP system to 5 operating companies. All 5 locations are running their business reasonably well, and we have seen improved system performance in recent weeks.", "As we have further evaluated system performance following our 2 deployments in Dallas and West Texas, we focused our thinking on 2 potential paths forward. We could either, one, proceed with our previously communicated rollout schedule and continue to work on enhancements at the same time; or two, continue to accelerate specific functional initiatives, such as human resources and general ledger accounting, while allowing the team to focus all of their time and effort on implementing enhancements to the broader SAP platform. We believe the latter option is the better approach for the following reasons: one, it allows us to continue to make substantial transformation progress while making future deployments easier and less complicated; and two, it also allows us to more effectively balance benefits, cost, risk and speed.", "It is important to note that the vast majority of the system functionality is performing as designed. However, as we have previously communicated, we do have issues that need to be addressed, such as pricing complexity and the inventory management functionality, before moving forward with a revised rollout schedule. We have isolated and understand the cause of these issues and are executing against a solid plan to remedy them.", "In the meantime, we're continuing our efforts to standardize, centralize and technology-enable many of our business processes. As we announced previously, we recently completed the rollout to all U.S. Broadline operating companies of both our CRM and SAP maintenance modules.", "Other similar efforts have been progressing rapidly. We have completed the rollout of the HR SAP module to 26 locations, with 4 going live every 2 weeks, and expect to complete the transition of our general ledger accounting functions to SBS in 42 locations by fiscal year end. We expect to complete the rollout of both of these initiatives to all U.S. Broadline locations by the end of the calendar year.", "We've also begun setting up master data files across the enterprise and are bringing locations on to this module in anticipation of the broader SAP rollout. This prepares us for a more rapid deployment in the future.", "To that end, we have restarted our operating company deployment preparation process and anticipate the enterprise-wide rollout to pick back up again around the end of the calendar year, and we will provide updates accordingly.", "Importantly, I should note that the revision of the rollout schedule will not impact the timing of the approximately $600 million in annual benefits from operating product costs targeted for fiscal 2015. Those benefits do not rely on the ERP system. We believe we are generally on track to achieve those savings within the time line we previously communicated.", "Leading our technology transformation effort is Wayne Shurts, who joined us this past October as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. He has extensive experience in leading IT organizations, including large SAP deployments, and I'm confident in his ability to lead us through this period of vital change. Wayne recently began to move forward on a major reorganization, which is designed to streamline and more effectively integrate our IT department and technology deployment teams. In so doing, he has and will continue to recruit individuals that are highly experienced in SAP and large systems implementations.", "We also continue to make solid progress on several of our other strategic initiatives. We recently completed the acquisition of Bahamas Food Service, which adds another attractive geographic market to our portfolio and provides a solid foundation for future growth. We are excited about welcoming Ben Frisch and his team to the Sysco family, and Chris will provide additional details on all of our acquisition activities in a few minutes.", "Our customer insight work continues to identify opportunities to provide enhanced value to our customers and more effectively establish Sysco's corporate brand. We continue to roll out and train our sales management and marketing associates on our new CRM tool so as to create a more efficient and effective sales process in this critical channel.", "We have added to and strengthened our merchandising team at all levels of management in preparation for rolling out our category management process to our customers in the coming weeks. Four categories comprise the pilot wave and represent nearly $1 billion in annual spend.", "A key step in building out our capabilities in this all-important area of our business was the hiring of Tom Bene as Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. Tom joined us in mid-April and will oversee our merchandising and supply chain activities as well as work closely with our sales, marketing and operations teams.", "As I conclude my prepared remarks, I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. Sysco is the clear leader in the $235 billion foodservice marketplace. While our industry has recently experienced some pronounced short-term pressures and has not consistently participated in the modest economic recovery to date, we expect this industry to achieve 1% to 2% annualized real growth over the long term. We have consistently grown our market share since our inception more than 40 years ago, and we are committed to continuing to do so in a profitable manner.", "Our industry has and will continue to experience significant change. We have proactively developed a solid strategy to expand our leadership position over the long term by renewing our focus on enhancing our customers' experience with Sysco so as to create ongoing profitable growth and strong free cash flow for our shareholders.", "We are driving our transformational change throughout Sysco. We must do so in order to realize our full potential as an enterprise. But such change is difficult and may result in uneven performance on our part in the short term. Through the exceptional talents and dedicated efforts of our 47,000 associates, we remain highly committed to, and focused on, providing outstanding value to our customers and shareholders as we move forward.", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $10.9 billion or an increase of 4.0% compared to the prior year, driven by case volume growth of 1.7% and food cost inflation of 2.4%. Acquisitions within the last 12 months increased sales by 1.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.1%.", "Gross profit in the third quarter increased 2.1%. Gross margin in the third quarter declined 34 basis points, and roughly half of this decline was due to the shift in customer mix as a result of faster growth in large regional and national customers. The remainder of the decline in gross margin was driven by the difficult sales environment during the quarter and continued competitive pressure.", "While we experienced good case growth in our large national and regional customers, our street case volume was particularly soft during the quarter. Overall, our case growth, excluding acquisitions, declined 0.2%.", "Operating expenses increased $140 million, or 9.8%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year period. Operating expenses for the quarter include $50 million in certain items, including a $41 million charge to withdraw from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan and $9 million in restructuring items mainly related to the freeze of our executive retirement plans. We provided guidance on both of these charges in an 8-K filed in January as well as during our last earnings call.", "Compared to the prior year period, certain items drove $46 million of the increase in operating expenses. Increased Business Transformation costs accounted for an additional $34 million of the operating expense increase. Lastly, salaries and related costs increased operating expenses by $22 million due mainly to increased 401(k) expense, acquisitions and higher delivery costs, partially offset by transformation benefits related to sales organization changes and our IT restructuring.", "As a result of all these items, operating income decreased $102 million or 23%.", "Net earnings for the third quarter were $201 million, a decrease of $58 million, or 22%, compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.34 per share, a 23% decrease compared to the prior year.", "Adjusting for certain items, such as the changes related to the MEPP withdrawal and restructuring retirement plans, diluted EPS was $0.40 per share for the quarter. As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it's important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which not only excludes the $50 million in certain items but also excludes Business Transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business as we go through our Business Transformation, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.4%, adjusted operating income decreased 4.4%, adjusted net earnings declined 1.4% and adjusted EPS declined 2% to $0.49 per share.", "We continue to be very active in the acquisition arena and have surpassed our stated goal of increasing sales from acquisitions by 0.5% to 1%. As Bill mentioned, in April, we completed the acquisition of Bahamas Food Service, a Broadline distributor based in the Bahamas. BFS has annualized sales of approximately $200 million. This acquisition further expands Sysco's international footprint and provides an even greater breadth and depth of products and services for our BFS customers. BFS is the leader in the Bahamian market, which has meaningful growth potential. We also believe that there are some synergies to be achieved between BFS and IFG, our international division that ships products throughout the Caribbean.", "Including this acquisition, to date in fiscal 2013, we have completed 11 transactions that, in the aggregate, approach nearly $1 billion in annualized sales.", "Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the third quarter, project expenses totaled $83 million, and we capitalized $4 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, project expenses totaled $49 million, and we capitalized $44 million related to the project.", "As Bill mentioned, although we continue to accelerate specific functional initiatives, we are going to implement enhancements to the broader SAP platform before continuing our enterprise-wide rollout schedule. As a result, we will not convert any additional operating companies this fiscal year. Our rollout schedule in fiscal '14 will be determined once we are able to assess the success and timing of the additional changes and enhancements we are making to this system.", "Our prior guidance for the run rate of project costs was $300 million to $350 million annually, and we still expect to be in that range for fiscal 2013. We'll be reassessing the ongoing costs over the next several months as we make these additional changes and enhancements.", "I want to reiterate that the changes to the timing of the deployment of the broader ERP platform have no impact on the approximately $600 million of annual benefits targeted for fiscal 2015. And as Bill mentioned, we believe we are generally on track to achieve these benefits. Examples of our progress so far include: expenses related to our retirement plans are significantly lower than they would have been had we not frozen all of our old plans, and we expect them to decline further next year; after restructuring our sales organization, expenses are significantly lower than the prior year; after restructuring our IT department, expenses are lower year-over-year.", "We're also making progress on our category management initiatives as we begin to roll out pilot categories to our customers, and the ongoing work of additional waves continues at a good pace. In addition, we are enhancing compliance across the organization with existing sourcing programs.", "Finally, we are making progress on some of the operations initiatives, including implementing our maintenance module and realigning our incentive plans for our driver and warehouse personnel.", "Unfortunately, this progress has been masked by the current difficult business environment and general operating performance of the underlying business that did not meet our expectations.", "Turning to our cash flow performance. At our Investor Day and recently again at CAGNY this year, we discussed our plans to gradually reduce capital expenditures back to historic rates. We've made good progress on this objective with capital expenditures declining $260 million in the first 39 weeks of this year compared to last year. We've seen a decline in capital spending related to the Business Transformation Project mainly driven by the fact that we began implementation of the new technology earlier this year. In the underlying business, we've seen lower capital spending because of a reduction in the number of major facilities projects this year compared to last and a more disciplined capital allocation and approval process.", "As a result of the reduction in capital spending, free cash flow increased 40% year-over-year to $386 million. We expect the impact of continued lower capital spending this year will contribute to an improvement in free cash flow in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.", "Cash flow from operations was flat year-over-year for the quarter and decreased $149 million for the first 39 weeks, primarily driven by the decline in net income.", "Turning to a couple of guidance items for a moment. We now believe our capital expenditures for the year will be $550 million to $575 million. This is lower than our previous guidance of $600 million to $650 million, partially due to the timing of certain construction projects, which will increase fiscal 2014 as compared to prior guidance.", "We continue to expect fuel expense for the year to increase in a range of $10 million to $20 million. Right now, it looks likely that we will come in at the high end of that range, although fuel prices have been recently trending down.", "In closing, the current economic recovery continues to be modest and marked by inconsistent consumer trends and unforeseen headwinds. The foodservice industry environment and our financial results reflect these challenges. However, we are working to improve on those elements of our business that we can control, including enhancing our product and service offering, managing our costs, increasing our free cash flow, achieving our targeted Business Transformation benefits and addressing the requirements of our technology transformation in a prudent manner. We also continue to ramp up our acquisition pipeline. The work we are doing will position us to take advantage of market trends as the health of the consumer recovers, enhance our ability to grow our market share over the long term and expand upon our leadership position in the industry.", "With that, operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Karen Short with BMO Capital Markets.", "Ryan Gilligan", "This is actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. Can you guys talk about the competitive environment maybe by customer type? Is the weakness with the independent customers due entirely to the environment? Or are you losing some share there?", "William J. DeLaney", "That's -- I would say the competitive environment overall is about the same as it's been the last 2 or 3 years. It certainly feels a little more acute right now just because of, I think, the pressure on a lot of our customers, but I don't know that it's any worse. It's hard for me to really measure that. I would say to you I think the competitive environment may be a little more acute or a little tougher with the smaller restaurant operators, that type of thing, where they're particularly under pressure, but that's more conjecture on my part than anything else. We don't have great data on that.", "Ryan Gilligan", "Okay. And switching to the category management initiative. Can you guys talk about how your customers and marketing associates are reacting to it, at least in the pilot categories?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. We've spent several weeks, and now months, working internally with our merchandising folks here and our operating companies. We've had meetings at all levels, including the presidents and VPs of sales and merchandising. We've run this out through our sales meetings, and that's still going on. So we haven't launched yet, but we would hope to launch these categories here over the next few weeks, as we said. Now it's being very well received. Obviously, people are very interested to see where the pricing is going to come in and that type of thing, but we've done a nice job, I think, in communicating internally. We're working well with our suppliers. And again, this is a different approach than what we've taken in the past with sourcing, whereas we're focusing on the assortment being broader and less redundant. We're looking to partner with our suppliers and customers to grow the business and take cost out at the same time. So we're optimistic. The one caution I guess would be this is something that we've never done before and really no one in this industry has done the way we're approaching it. So we expect that there'll be some challenges as we go forward, but at this point our people are very excited about it.", "Operator", "And we'll now take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So a couple of things. So first, Bill, do you think -- when you look at the macro environment, what, if anything, can you guys do to stimulate demand with your customers and be comfortable that the price elasticity, if that's what drives it, is acceptable?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I think, John, what we have to do is focus on the micro environment. So the macro -- we've talked for a while now, you're very familiar with us and this industry. What I tried to lay out in my prepared comments is that we still think this industry is going to grow at modest levels, 1%, 1.5%, 2% maybe, but there's going to be some peaks and valleys and we're in a little bit of a trough right now, especially on the restaurant side. Last year, we saw more growth. First half of this year, we saw more growth. So I think the key is these strategic initiatives that we've been discussing, and this is where we're going places where we haven't been before. So it starts with the customer, John. We have excellent service levels out there in terms of how our MAs provide support to their customers, our on-time deliveries, we're in stock, all that type of thing. We perform at a very high level. Now from the customer's perspective, probably the other guys have gotten better over time, so that gap isn't as big. But in reality, we're compared to how we did last week. So we need to continue to do well operationally from a basic service standpoint, but we need to also differentiate ourselves more and more. So it starts with better understanding what's important to the customer. And we've got some good work going on there with Bill Goetz and his marketing team. I think that will take us to some segment work, where, when you look at that 1% to 2% growth, probably most of that is going to come in ethnic segments, and we're going to have to continue to strengthen our ability to focus in on those groups, focus in on certain geographies where we have a lot more upside from a market share standpoint, that type of thing. We believe category management over the long term will be very good for our customers and for Sysco. And again, we're approaching that in a very balanced way, both from a growth and from a cost savings standpoint. And Sysco Ventures, while it's still very much in its development stage, we're hoping to have a platform in place there soon, where we can augment our product offerings with several services and technology-based business solutions that should create greater traction with our customers as well. So when -- again, when I talk about we've got a proactive strategy for a new world, a new environment, those are 3 or 4 of the things that I'm trying to focus on.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "What do you think you get most out of category management? Is that more a benefit in terms of purchasing? Is it more getting the assortment right geographically? What do you think are the one or 2 big wins there?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think in the short term, there are certainly savings on the gross product cost savings side. But I think over the medium term, it will help us work with our customers and focus more on creating an assortment that is more relevant to their marketplace and will allow them to grow their business more effectively rather than have a lot of redundant SKUs, and not just in our warehouses but, to some extent, in their pantry as well. So I think it starts certainly with the cost savings, but it will only be successful, fully successful, if we're able to grow our business and support our customers' growth at the same time.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Then lastly, the $500 million you talked about, that's a gross benefit, correct?", "William J. DeLaney", "I'm not sure the -- what $500 million are you talking about?", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Well, because what I'm thinking about -- as you push out the implementation of ERP, do the -- that -- you would -- that pushes out the cost of the program or no?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "The actual implementation cost, yes, of course.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. Yes, sure. But where we're focused on right now -- I'll let Chris jump in here. But, I mean, what we're focused on right now, John, is getting a really good handle on what's the most effective way to go forward here over the next 2 or 3 years in terms of deployment, and we'll be assessing the annual cost as we do that. So we've got to look at pace, and we've got to look at annual cost at the same time.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "John, was your question about the approximately $600 million of annualized benefits we've referred to?", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, yes.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Okay.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "What about these...", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes. So first and foremost, both Bill and I have said that those are not impacted by the timing of our ERP rollout. Secondly, we would -- we actually don't characterize those as gross costs. To the extent that we have costs associated with implementation, we're actually -- we have to cover those. But we expect that $600 million to be net.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Over and above implementation cost?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "That is correct, yes.", "William J. DeLaney", "And John, I'm not trying to confuse this, but...", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Well, hang on, John, let me -- I can go -- I'm going to cut you off. They're separate categories. $300 million to $350 million is an actual operating -- or implementation expense, operating expense around ERP, we're going to have that, and we'll continue to give you annual guidance on that. The $600 million is a gross benefit, yes. We don't net the 2 together. If you want to do that, feel free to do that.", "William J. DeLaney", "Right.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "But the benefit that we look at is that $600 million, which we would hope to be even more than that as we get further out, we've only given 3 years of guidance, that will be with us forever and ever. The implementation cost will eventually go away.", "William J. DeLaney", "That's what I was going to say, but Chris said it better. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll now move to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "A follow-up on the $600 million savings. I'm looking at the Investor Day presentation, where a little over half was SG&A and the rest from COGS. Is that still roughly how you're thinking of it? Second, Chris, you mentioned restructuring, sales, your retirement plans, other things. Could you give us sort of the run rate of what you have achieved in dollars and I guess build a bridge using the cost of goods sold and category management to get to the $600 million?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, well, I probably won't go so far as to build a bridge for you, but let me start with the top of your question and work my way to the bottom. So we did say $550 million to $650 million. We're just saying approximately $600 million midpoint. We said about 25% of that would be in the first year. So roughly, call it the midpoint, $150 million-ish worth of benefits for the first year. We do believe we're on track in the first year. We laid out kind of how we were going to get there, and you obviously have looked at the slides in terms of there'll be a component that's SG&A, there'll be a component that's lower cost of goods. We've kind of said in different calls we're getting to our number. We're not getting there exactly the way we thought we would get there. So some of the front-end stuff, restructuring our pension plans, et cetera, very painful, very difficult stuff to do, but you can do it rather quickly. So we got to that fairly fast. The SG&A component and specifically the S part of that, the sales component, that's work that's been done. And frankly, we thought it would take longer to get to that, and it happened a little sooner than we thought. And then some of the, what I'll call operating expense reductions and initiatives out in the field, given the environment, those are coming along slower than we thought. They're a little harder. We haven't tried to give you a bridge on the retirement planning stuff. That's a little bit difficult. We did, I think, telegraph what the overall savings are this year compared to what they would have been, which I believe is about $85 million better than what they would have been with the discount rates and the other factors that go into that calculation. On a year-over-year basis, they're $15 million to $20 million worse than last year. So we've given you that. And then the only other thing, I think, we've tried to telegraph to you without numbers is the expenses will be frankly higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year on that increase. So $15 million to $20 million year-over-year higher, but you actually get a little benefit in the first part of the year and detriment in the last part of the year just because of the way the accounting works. Next year, we expect those costs will go down further as the run rate kicks in.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. And just on the bridge idea, I can appreciate you not wanting to update that or spend the whole call on that. But is it fair to say the cost of goods sold component is the majority or the largest part of what's to come?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I would say actually no. The way we worked out the $600 million, it almost equally balanced between the lower cost of goods and then lower operating costs. The timing of those is different. The category management initiatives are back-end loaded because there's a much longer ramp-up period, there's a testing period, there's a pilot period and then you start delivering wave after wave. So we've talked a lot about the 4 pilot categories. We're now to the point where they actually get rolled out, and then you have waves that come after them. So year 1 is pretty light in terms of lower cost of goods. A lot of what we're getting in year 1 we've said would be from additional sourcing initiatives, specifically better compliance around sourcing. We are seeing that. Category management has ramped up really well, and now we've got to see benefits from category management in year 2 and even more in year 3. So the timing is not equal, but the overall benefit from each of those 2 major components is about equal in the $600 million figure.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. Andy, I think the other thing I would add to that is on the SG&A, Chris is on point we've -- we're off to a fast start there. I think you'll see more of that in year 2 on the admin side as some of the pension benefits kick in again next year. So we're doing a little better there than we planned on the SG&A side. Not quite as well on the operating cost savings. That's turned out to be a little more complex than what we thought. But we are -- we have turned the corner there, and we're expecting to see good improvement. We managed our expenses actually pretty well in the third quarter given the environment at the operating company level, and I think we'll see good results there over the balance of this year and next year. And then the COGS, Chris nailed that as well. We -- the first year, what was implied in those savings was pretty modest, more about sourcing. So year 2 becomes the first big year on the category management. Now look, we haven't even launched it yet, so we'll talk more about it as we get into it and see what's working and what some of the challenges are. A little color on that. It's a massive undertaking. We've strengthened the team quite a bit, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And we feel good about the savings. But it may take a little longer to roll this out than what we originally thought, but we also expect the benefits to continue beyond the third year here as well. So we're excited about that, but, again, we've got a lot of work to do here over the next few months.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "And just lastly on the same subject, now how do you think about sharing the savings with customers to drive market share or just help their business so they can increase their same-store sales through lower menu prices? And -- or it's sort of being presented, at least the way that I'm hearing it, as if it's sort of all slated to go to shareholders and earnings power directly. But could it go more indirectly through supporting your customers?", "William J. DeLaney", "You must be talking to our competitors, I guess. That's not the way we're presenting it. Look, what we've tried to do here over the last few years, Andy, we are sourcing work as we've further developed our supply chain work and some of our internal transfer pricing. The whole key here is for us to continue to get better at providing our operating companies with what we call market-relevant pricing. And that's easier -- that's an easier figure to quantify and determine in some categories than it is in others. So what we will do is we will lock in some pretty meaningful gross savings. And as appropriate, we would expect to pass along some of those savings to our customers to make sure that our sales people are properly positioned on the street with good, solid pricing. And I think you'll probably see us, early days, invest some money in promotions, too, just to help grease the skids, here. Because this is change, and we think it's good change, but any change is difficult these days. So I think you'll see us invest in price to some extent, to the extent that we think that's appropriate, and also some promotional activity.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "And Andy, as we calculated the potential benefits from category management, we made the assumption we would have to, need to, want to pass through some of the cost savings down to the customer level. As Bill said, some just to get the market-relevant pricing and some just more temporary promotional-type spending. So those numbers are built into our estimates. We've already learned in the pilot categories in some places we were a little conservative, in some places we were too aggressive. We expect we'll get that in every wave, but we've made an estimate and it's in those numbers already.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay. So you're saying the $250 million to $300 million is net of what we're talking about?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "It is net of our estimate of what we believe we will need to pass down to make this work all the way through to the customer level, that's correct. Now again, as Bill said, we're at the point where we're going to the customer. So we're about to see how good our estimates are.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Last quick question. Has volume picked up any in March and in April?", "William J. DeLaney", "I'd say the trends are a little bit better, but the problem is February was just ugly. And so we just saw a significant falloff as you see in some of the restaurant publications in February. So I'd say it's still been somewhat soft here in March and April, but the trends are better than what we saw in February.", "Operator", "We'll now move to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Bill, you talked about volume getting better throughout the year. Is that just based on what you said about sort of March, April? Or are you expecting volume to get better incrementally on top of that?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think what I'm trying to say, Ed, is we got hit with a lot of things, our customers got hit with a lot of things in this past quarter, and I think some of that will cycle out. So, I mean, if you guys go back and listen, I've probably done 25 calls since I've been back here 6 years. I hate talking about weather. But -- I don't think you'd find that I've talked about it hardly at all. But we have had weather issues going back to last year where it was a very favorable winter. This year, some strange weather in some different places. And even in April, we've seen an extended winter and all that type of thing. So I think some of that will run its course and that, that should help us a little bit. I'm not going to say it's dramatic, but it's a piece of it. I think some things I've touched on the -- however you want to quantify the impact of the FICA taxes and that type of thing, I think that did impact the consumer. So the key for us is the mindset of the consumer. That's what will drive them back into our customers in a bigger way and a more regular way than what we've seen. I'm not really talking about Friday night and Saturday night. I'm talking about family specials on Wednesday and business trade maybe a little bit more during the week. So I just think some of these things we've run into are somewhat more short term or cyclical in nature, and I would expect them to ease over the balance of the calendar year.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just -- I wanted to clarify a couple of things on the cost savings program and ERP. Are you -- I think are you telling us you're still expecting 50% to 70% of the cost savings in 2014. Is that right?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, we've not changed our guidance over the 3-year period. Obviously, we're building our plans right now for fiscal '14, so we're going to be taking a much closer look at where we think we'll be. But our 3-year guidance, the $600 million over the 3 years, we're good with that. The pace and sequence of that, as Bill and I have both said, we're ahead in some areas, behind in others. We've got to take a look at '14 specifically. We typically provide you guidance. To the extent we provide guidance, we provide it in our fourth quarter call so you can expect some more information from us then if we're going to change anything. But right now, like I say I -- we're making good progress in a lot of areas. As I've said in my prepared comments, it's being masked by a lot of the other stuff that's going on, unfortunately.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And to that as well, the costs associated with the program, it sounds like possibly could be higher in '14 than the $300 million, $350 million? Is that a fair way to think about it?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I'm not sure what we might have said that led you to that conclusion. We're -- we-- obviously, we've got to take a look at that as we make the changes and enhancements that Bill and I both referred to in the system and start to relaunch. Look, if anything, I'm kind of looking at those costs like this. We took up a lot of pain to get to the place we're at now, which is we're at a run rate of somewhere in the $300 million to $350 million range annually. So that's now built into our expenses, as painful as it was to get here. We're going to be very, very cautious about allowing that number to go any higher, and we're going to work very, very diligently to try to figure out a way to actually implement this thing at a lower annual run rate. That's work that we're doing right now. Wayne and his team are working very hard to figure out ways to do it less expensively. I'm not sure we're going to accomplish it, but that's our goal.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then when you gave 2015 guidance, a lot has kind of transpired between now and then. Should we as investors assume that, that 2015 guidance is good until you were to actively address it?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, that's kind of a normal -- the normal rule is unless we change the guidance, we still believe in it. Look, we're not trying to sugarcoat anything. It's been tough here. When you give 3 years of guidance and your first year comes out of the box weak, it makes it hard to still see a path to your third year. But we're one year into it. So we're going to be relooking at all of that and see whether we still have a path to achieve it. Again, I've talked about the underlying business has to continue to perform. We've got to hit on all cylinders on the initiatives and the benefits we're going to achieve there to get to that guidance. We feel pretty good about the initiatives. The underlying business, unfortunately with the headwinds, we're struggling with a little bit. So we've got to hit on all cylinders to be able to get certainly to the top end of that guidance. Whether we're in the middle or at the low end of that guidance still is something we'll work through as we update our planning.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Just one last question for you on sort of balance sheet, cash flows. Your working capital to, I guess, if you look sort of year-to-date, it's been a little bit of headwind. I was hoping you could just talk specifically about working capital management, especially as sort of inventory up about 8% year-over-year and I think receivables are up 10%, something like that. So just what your thoughts are there.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, it's -- the story has really not changed since my comments last quarter. We continue to make progress on accounts payable, and we actually made maybe another $100 million of ground on accounts payable in this last quarter on a year-over-year basis. But we lost about $200 million combined between inventory and accounts receivable. Part of that is we are continuing to grow with our large regional and national customers, and they typically have longer receivable cycles. And so that -- I'll call that a mix issue, but it's certainly something that's affecting the number. We had some preestablished contractual changes that allowed for days to go out a little further on a couple of customers. So that's in there as well. Inventory is a tricky issue because while we realize it's going the wrong direction or certainly it's going a way we'd rather it not, for working capital purposes, you can't just try to shut it down too quickly because it does affect service levels. So we're being very prudent and careful in how we look at moderating or slowing down the growth in inventory, and we're putting in place or at least working on plans that we can put in place to start to bring that back down. It is going to be slower progress than I had hoped it would be, so we're doing what we can, which is on accounts payable. We're trying to make sure we manage accounts receivable and not let it extend further. And then inventory is something that's going to take a little longer to bring back into control.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I'd like to start just with what you said at the very beginning about the change in how you're going to roll out the ERP system. It might be helpful if you could divide up the functions or the tasks that it will do and tell us what's delayed, which I'm assuming is the warehouse management part of it, and what parts of it are still being rolled out, which I think is HR and general ledger. Am I understanding that right?", "William J. DeLaney", "Okay. Let me start here, Meredith, and I'll let Chris help me out. So let's go back to the beginning. Warehouse and delivery are not part of the ERP rollout. We have excellent systems, and from day one, we never included those in the deployments. So those systems are the best-in-breed and operating fine. Obviously, they need to be interfaced with SAP, and we're -- so there's no issue there. The hub of the system, the operating system itself, is more on the sales inventory replenishment, purchasing side of the business as well as, over time, the financial reporting, all right? So what we're saying -- I'm going to go the end first and come back. So what we're saying is we're making good progress with some things we can do without fully rolling out the entire integrated SAP system with the general ledger system moving into SBS. With our, what we call our human resource module, with our maintenance module that we're using in our shops. And separately from that, with our CRM module, which we've integrated with -- from Salesforce.com. So those things are all moving along well, and we expect a couple of them are fully deployed already, as we mentioned, in the U.S. and the other 2 will be fully deployed, we expect, by the end of the calendar year. Where the delay is or where we're doing more work is on the sales purchasing inventory replenishment side, pricing side of the business. Again, I would say to you the vast majority of the system is highly functional. It's just not -- there's pieces of it that are not as functional as it needs to be for us to run this business at the level that we run it at. And we've made the decision to step back and allow our deployment teams to focus 100% of their time on addressing those issues across-the-board on the SAP platform, while the other teams can continue to drive up these other modules. And we just felt that, that's a more prudent way to go, to get better depth and better focus in terms of what the issues are and remedy these things somewhat more cohesively. Rather than try to continue to -- we could have rolled out a few more companies but to continue to do that and work on these other issues with the system just dilutes people's attention and creates resource needs, and we felt that, that was not the way to go at this stage of the game.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And the category management effort, you don't need to have the SAP system in terms of pricing, inventory management, inventory replenishment, purchasing. You don't need that to do category management?", "William J. DeLaney", "At some point it would have facilitated a great deal, but we don't need it to roll out category management.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, we have systems that we've operated with for, well, much longer than I've been here, for at least a decade, that can certainly handle everything that we're trying to accomplish with category management. It will be easier, more efficient and faster when we have the new system in place.", "William J. DeLaney", "So, I mean, at some point, the reason we're going forward here, at some point we do need an end-to-end system to run this business and have visibility to what's gone into a very complex business. But to begin to roll it out, we do not need it.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then I have a question, sort of follow to Ed's question about working capital. You had a very big sale of treasury stock in the latest quarter, bigger -- even if you look at the purchase of treasury stock, it was substantially higher. Could you just talk about what prompted you to do that? And it does seem to me that it helped fund the dividend. Is that an alternative to borrowing?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, it's not something we did. It was the exercise of options. And so the stock got to a high place it hadn't been in a while, and we have a lot of employees that have been sitting on options, a number of which were expiring this year. And so we saw quite a bit of option exercise during the quarter to the tune of, I want to say, about $500 million, or I -- actually, I think that's the year-to-date number, about $500 million, a lot of which came in the third quarter. So it's not something we did to finance anything. It's something, frankly, the employees have the right to do whenever they want to exercise as long as they follow the guidelines.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "But my -- the second part of my question is if you hadn't gotten that option exercising, how would -- would you have had an issue funding the dividend?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, we...", "William J. DeLaney", "We have no issue funding the dividend. We have a very strong credit rating, and we have a tremendous amount of debt capacity.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, I mean...", "Robert C. Kreidler", "We have fewer shares outstanding.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "And Meredith, we -- I mean, I know you understand our cash flow statements very, very well. We start with just the amount of cash we produce from the business. And then frankly, everything after that becomes a discretionary item and you just determine your priorities. The dividend is a priority for us. So a lot of what we're doing in terms of becoming more efficient with our capital expenditure is to drive more cash to the bottom line in terms of free cash flow. That is just more cash available to do whatever we think the shareholders would like us to do, one of which we know is the dividend. So we have plenty of available cash from operations as well as borrowing capacity.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, no doubt about the borrowing capacity. And then I had a question about Mother's Day. I know you've been kind enough to update us on April. Mother's Day, I believe, is one of the very biggest holidays that impact the restaurant industry. Can you -- and we're less than a week away. I'm a mother, I can say that. Any comment on how that's shaping up? Or do you think it makes a continuation of the weakness that we've seen so far?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, first of all, Happy Mother's Day. Yes, it's -- today's day one of Mother's Day Week for us, Meredith. So a little early to tell. Neil won't let me give daily guidance on sales. So typically, the way these shape up is we generally have this week and there's a week right around when the schools go back in session maybe the week before Labor Day, which typically are our 2 biggest weeks of the year. So we would expect to have a big week. But the reality is the toughest comparisons are the big weeks against big weeks. So I'm not sure to what extent there'll be an increase or how big of an increase. But the one thing you can pretty much count on is almost everybody goes out for some type of meal on Mother's Day weekend, and we would certainly expect to benefit from that.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "I wanted to just get your feedback on the softness that's -- specifically in your street account business that, Bill, I think you talked about in your prepared comments. I guess, as it relates to the street accounts, that has both sales and margin implications. So is there anything specific you can point to in terms of the underlying volume trends in terms of what was behind the decline sequentially in Q3? And can you also comment on whether you're seeing any pickup in the sales environment in the current quarter? I guess that's another variation of some of the questions that were asked earlier, but I just -- I'm asking in the context of your higher margin, your independent restaurant operators.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, Ajay, well, I can just try to give a little color here. And if I'm nailing it, just follow up. But I think the biggest thing we're trying to bring out -- so if you look at the quarter, it's a -- I think it's largely a sales story. We manage margins reasonably well at the segment level. We actually did a decent job managing our cost per case in the oPCos. That's hard to see with all the back and forth in some of the expense numbers, but I'll share that with you. But the restaurant segment in particular, we saw across-the-board a lot of pressure on most of our restaurant customers, whether they were independent or whether they were contract customers. The difference is that restaurants make up a larger piece, a very large piece, of our \"street business.\" So I think the big story here is right, it was a tough order for restaurants. That's a big piece of our street business, and our street business is a -- has a disproportionately higher profitability in particular on the gross margin line, so -- because of the value-added services that we provide. So if you just do the math, I mean, if you look at the first half of the year, our gross profit dollars were up about 3.5%, I think it was 3.4%. And they're up about 2%, 2.1% this quarter. So I'm not laying all of that on the street side, but I think it's a big piece of it. And so when your street business doesn't grow at the same rate and that, in fact, has very modest growth, that puts pressure on your gross profit dollars, and that's what we saw on both of those lines, both the top line and the gross profit line. As far as trends, I think I addressed that earlier. Technically, I can tell you the trends are better, but that's more  function of February was just very difficult. It's still somewhat soft in our business right now. I still think some of that is cyclical. And to Meredith's question, I think May and June will be a much better barometer in our business.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then just shifting gears. On ERP, I think when you gave your preliminary outlook for fiscal '13, it was -- I think it was clear that a lot of the anticipated cost savings were not necessarily related to Business Transformation. I think you confirmed that today from a longer-term perspective through fiscal '15. But with 3 quarters in now, can you just quantify how much of the intended cost savings you've been able to achieve? And I know you're also confirming that you're on track for $600 million of cost savings by fiscal '15, but can you give some frame of reference for again, on where you are year-to-date and if $150 million of cost benefits are -- is that still the right number for this year?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, Ajay, as I think I said earlier, we're on track for the 25% of the $600-ish million in year 1. We're on track to achieve that for year 1. We're not going to get into the quarter-by-quarter assessment of where we are. And frankly, that's always going to be something hard and difficult to pull out of our numbers, but we feel pretty good about where we are for this year. And as we said, we feel good about the 3-year run rate as well. That's pretty much the extent that we're going to go.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I think Chris said this earlier, Ajay. Look, when you look at the 3 big pieces of what we've laid out here in the road map, there's an assumption of an underlying growth rate of the business. We've talked about 4% to 6%. So if you'd use the midpoint of 5%, then there's the $600 million, which is, as we've discussed now at length, half of that, give or take, is operating cost, half of it is cost of goods, okay? And then there's the investment we're making annually in the deployment of the technology platform. So I think we're generally on track on those last 2. We not as far along as we'd like to be on the deployments, but in terms of expense and benefits, we're generally on track. Clearly, for this year, we're not seeing the 5% growth in the business that's in that road map. So we either need to make it up in benefits, which we're not putting that on the table today, and hopefully we'll get a better market environment here and better execution on our part over the next couple of years.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And just one final question. Now I know you don't want to get into quarterly projections. But on the project expenses, you indicated that $300 million to $350 million is still the right range for this year. But that still leaves a lot of variability for Q4. So is there any way you can give some more specificity on the expenses for Q4?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Not on Q4. I'll tell you for the year, based on my current forecast, so I got 3 years of -- or 3 quarters of actual and forecast for 1 quarter. I mean, we're in that -- we're in the top part of that range, but we're -- right now, we're not really at risk of going over that range.", "Operator", "We'll now take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's Amod Gautam filling in for John. The first question was on the ERP and Business Transformation in terms of how it's affecting -- whether or not you're getting a better view on individual account profitability. In other words, could your number of accounts and/or market share potentially drop, but would more efficient pricing and logistics allow increased profitability?", "William J. DeLaney", "I don't think we're far enough along to really give you a great answer to that question. I think what we will have and certainly one of the benefits of an end-to-end system is we're going to have a better view on what we call or what some people call activity-based costing. So I think we will have a better view of profitability. And I'm sure -- well, we've done a lot of customer stratification here over the last 5 or 6 years, so I'm sure that we will have some earnings there. I think generally, we have a pretty good handle on how we make money. And so I don't know that there'll be significant falloff there in terms of customers. There might be an opportunity to sit down and have a more balanced discussion on our costs versus their costs and how we make the whole thing work together. That's typically how we try to work. I think the key for us really is as we get better visibility to our costs and what our customers' needs are to continue down that differentiation path and explore different channels, that may be more cost effective for our customers. So we're, as you know, a very traditional Broadline distributor, and there may be opportunities, whether it's inside sales or other vehicles for people to purchase food in ways that we typically don't provide to them, and perhaps there'll be an opportunity for us to get into those adjacencies. And that's certainly one of the things that we talked about in terms of how we can grow the potential for the business over time.", "Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of the acquisitional environment, I know you've talked -- you've got -- both of you have commented for some time that it's been somewhat a favorable acquisition environment that's driving growth above the long-term 50 to 100 basis points that you've talked to. Is that something we should continue to expect? Or are changes to the ERP rollout and potentially some pushout of the -- some CapEx, is that going to affect your acquisitional strategy in any way?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "It should not affect it. The types of deals that we discuss and that we've been talking a lot about this year are kind of our pipeline deals. They're small enough to where they can be fairly easily integrated into the system. We're not really concerned about an ERP rollout with those types of transactions. And then as far as CapEx, we actually -- when we talk about CapEx, that's kind of a separate line item. It does not include acquisitions themselves. So we still intend to -- I'm sure next year, we'll probably be giving guidance that at least 1% is our goal and our target. As we go forward, we'll update you to make sure that's -- what our guidance is going to be. But I think we've built a robust enough pipeline to feel good about maintaining that kind of 1%-plus range for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "And we'll now move to an Erin Lash with Morningstar.", "Erin Swanson Lash - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Most of my questions have been asked and answered. So I was wondering if you could talk about the marketing relationship that you've had with Chef Robert Irvine and the Food Network in general, and maybe any additional thoughts as to the traction that you're seeing from those efforts or any additional opportunities you see from leveraging that relationship.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, thanks, Erin. So we just completed our first season with the Food Network and with Chef Irvine. As those of you came to CAGNY, he's a very compelling speaker and very enthusiastic supporter of Sysco. We've had very good response. The goal here going in was to create greater brand identity in terms of the corporate brand. Our research told us that 70% -- a little over 70% of our customers actually watch the Food Network in search of ideas to help them run their business better. He has this show, Restaurant: Impossible, that goes out and frankly does what we try to do it in a different way, which is to help our customers be more successful in their business. So that whole partnership is off to a very good start. It's created some goodwill, I guess for lack of a better term, with our sales force and at a time when we're throwing a lot of change at our sales force. And we've talked a lot about the market this morning, so it's been a difficult out there on the street. So very well received there. He has done some in-person functions in different locales that we're located in, and it's just created tremendous enthusiasm and tremendous goodwill, and we do believe that it's resonating with our customer base. So it's still early, but we're very excited about the relationship and hope to continue to grow it.", "Operator", "And with that, if there are no further questions, I'd like to conclude the conference today and thank you, everyone, for your participation.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We'll begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to introduce the call -- I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Neil A. Russell", "Thank you, operator, and good warning, everyone. Welcome to Sysco's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2013 Earnings Call. Today, you will hear prepared remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012, and in the news release issued earlier this morning, which is posted in the Investors section at sysco.com and can be found on the Sysco IR app, which can be downloaded from the iTunes App Store and Google Play.", "Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in the presentation slides.

All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volumes include total Broadline and SYGMA combined.", "[Operator Instructions]", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Sysco's financial results, announced this morning, reflect a year that has both produced several significant successes and provided us with many challenges. While we have seen a slow and steady economic recovery, it is clear that the foodservice industry, as a whole, has not fully participated in that recovery.", "At the same time, we are driving on a much-needed transformational change throughout Sysco. This change has broadened scope, will permit us to enhance the products and services we provide our customers and will allow us to build upon our industry-leading position for years to come. Successfully implementing change of this large scale requires strong leadership, substantial effort by our associates, and more often than we would like, patience from our various stakeholders.", "Starting with the market, it is clear that certain elements of the overall economy appear to be recovering. Consumer confidence is near its highest level since 2008, housing sales and prices have consistently improved this year and unemployment levels are declining. However, a deeper look at the data reveals that consumer confidence remains well off its historic highs, unemployment levels do not fully reflect the number of individuals who would like to work but have given up, and personal income is stagnant.", "As a result, we believe many consumers have become much more disciplined in their spending habits, and this has directly impacted our business, particularly our street business with independent foodservice operators.", "Today's consumers are more actively allocating their disposable income, and eating out has been deprioritized from some consumers' personal budgets. We believe this trend is more cyclical than structural in nature, but acknowledge that greater consumer confidence will be required to reverse it.", "Reflecting these factors, this morning, Sysco reported its sales for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $11.6 billion, and net earnings were $283 million. EPS declined 11% to $0.47, in part due to increased costs from business transformation and restructuring items. Excluding these costs, adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business, was $0.59, declining 6% compared to the prior year.", "Sales for the fiscal year were $44 billion, a record for Sysco, and net earnings were nearly $1 billion. EPS declined 12% to $1.67, which was mainly due to increased costs from business transformation, multi-employer pension plan withdrawals and restructuring. Adjusting for these costs, adjusted EPS, representing our underlying business, was $0.01 lower compared to the prior year at $2.14.", "Cash flow from operations grew by 8%, and free cash flow increased significantly to $1 billion. Our sales growth for the year was driven by case volume growth of 3% and product cost inflation of 2%. Earnings growth did not meet our expectations, as pricing pressures and lighter street sales growth resulted in only modest gross profit dollar gains.", "Helping to mitigate these pressures, we did achieve our overall targeted business transformation benefits for the year, with reduced selling and administrative costs providing the most benefit. We expect to achieve our overall targeted benefits in the new fiscal year as well.", "As we close this fiscal year, it's an appropriate time to reflect on our successes, as well as those areas where we need to improve. We should start with the fact that our industry is being impacted by many developing trends and realities. Growth in foodservice is projected to remain modest, about 1% to 2% real growth per annum, and our customers are increasingly value-focused. As a result, we expect pricing pressures will likely continue, and in addition, nontraditional competitors have become more of a factor. And lastly, consumer spending trends in our space are gradually shifting more to fresh, natural and sustainably produced products. We continue to focus on ways to respond to and capitalize on those trends in our own business, as well as in partnership with our customers and suppliers.", "One of our most significant challenges continues to be gross margin compression. Several of the trends I know that are contributing to this challenge, in addition, are shifting customer mix in recent quarters has adversely impacted gross margin, as our more value-added local and street customer business has not kept pace with our larger but lower-margin multiunit customer business.", "This area has management's full attention, and we expect to improve our gross margin trends as fiscal 2014 progresses by effectively implementing our category management initiative and gradually improving our street growth performance.", "Another significant challenge during the year was the unanticipated delay in deploying our SAP technology platform. However, we are now making progress in developing required system enhancements. This work primarily focuses on simplifying certain processes to improve response times and to reduce system loads, which will lead to improved system stability and will also lead to improved ability to scale the system as we go forward.", "We expect to restart convergence of the broad SAP rollout around the end of this calendar year at our Boise, Idaho company. And as our system enhancements in our 5 SAP operating companies take hold and the products' successful deployment in Boise, we would anticipate deploying additional operating company locations beginning early in calendar 2014.", "Notwithstanding all these challenges, I'm encouraged by several of the key successes we experienced during the past year. We grew sales at our corporate managed customers by 6% for the year, with the Broadline portion of this business up 9%. We completed acquisitions during the year of 14 companies, representing annualized sales of over $1 billion. These deals contributed significantly to our sales growth during the year and enhanced our international market presence and product capabilities.", "We exceeded our targeted business transformation benefits for the year. The majority of the benefits achieved were driven by changes in our retirement programs and sales and IT organizational changes. We're making significant progress in our category management initiative. Our pilot waves include 4 categories: french fries, dressings, shrimp, and tissues, towels and napkins. 3 of the 4 categories were launched in the market in June, with the fourth, shrimp, planned to launch in the fall.", "Customer acceptance of the new assortments in the pilots has been encouraging. Conversion rates are running ahead of where we expected to be at this point in the process, and our customers appreciate the increased variety and value offered by our new optimized assortment.", "Our supplier partners are highly engaged in all phases of the process and also appreciate our approach to this initiative, in particular, our focus on building strategic partnerships, which we believe deliver benefits for all parties. We and our suppliers are sharing customer insights to enhance product innovation and improve our response to customer trends. And our ability to commit volumes to our supplier partners allows them to more efficiently service the business.", "As is true in all pilots, we've learned along the way, and we appreciate our customers' and suppliers' engagement as we move through the process. We have a very aggressive implementation plan, and we'll continually improve our processes as we move forward with each successive wave.", "Cost per case in our Broadline business declined year-over-year, demonstrating our continuing efforts to reduce our operating cost structure. We reduced our cost, in particular, in our selling and administrative areas. Specifically, we aggressively drove cost-reduction initiatives in selling by implementing a customer relationship management platform, or CRM; flattening our sales management organization structure; modifying compensation plans for our marketing associates, or MAs, to incentivize growth; and reducing the number of unprofitable sales territories.", "Some of our operating companies executed these initiatives better than others. And while we realized significant cost savings, we no doubt experienced some sales loss in certain markets as well. We believe the impact of all of these changes has now been largely absorbed, and that our local sales organizations are well positioned to accelerate growth as fiscal 2014 progresses.", "We generated free cash flow during the year of $1 billion, exceeding our expectations. This was a direct result in improvements in working capital trends, as well as renewed focus on better prioritization of our capital expenditure opportunities. We will continue our work to improve our working capital metrics, as we believe there's ample opportunity to do so.", "We've also made significant progress on many other individual elements of our business transformation initiatives. Specifically, this year, we completed the rollout of our CRM module to all U.S. and Canadian Broadline operating companies. We completed the rollout of the SAP maintenance module to all U.S. Broadline locations. We expect to complete the rollout of the SAP human resource module to all U.S. Broadline locations by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2014, and we expect to complete the centralization of our general ledger accounting functions for all U.S. Broadline locations by the end of the calendar year. And we have begun implementing enhancements to our routing technology and processes to further improve delivery efficiencies and expect this initiative to be completed in fiscal 2015. Pilot locations have completed the enhancements of experienced reductions in mileage of approximately 5%.", "We increased our dividend during this past year to 44x since we went public in 1970. In total, we distributed nearly $650 million of dividends to our shareholders during fiscal 2013. We recognize that our dividend represents a significant component of Sysco's shareholder return, especially as we navigate through our transformational changes.", "Lastly, we have strengthened our management team this year in several strategic areas throughout the company. In addition to other key initiatives -- in addition to other key additions I've mentioned in previous calls, we recently welcomed Scott Charlton to lead our Distribution Services team and fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Fred Lankford. Scott brings significant supply chain experience from the retail grocery industry, which will greatly benefit our company over time.", "As we look forward, we'll be managing our business by aligning around several core metrics: case growth and mix, gross profit dollar growth and cost per case. But we expect a modest level of continuing gross margin compression in the year ahead. We also expect to grow both our corporate and locally managed customer business and to once again reduce our overall cost per case. Considering these improvements and additional benefits from our business transformation initiatives, we would expect our earnings performance trends in fiscal 2014 to gradually improve.", "In closing, I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. With the support of our customers and suppliers and through the talents and efforts of generations of committed associates, Sysco has grown into a company that last year produced $44 billion in sales, as well as approximately $1 billion in both net earnings and free cash flow.", "We are proud to be the leader in the $235 billion foodservice industry that we participate in and take our leadership role very seriously. We recognized a few years ago that our industry's growth rate would begin to plateau, that the industry would undergo significant changes over time, and that we would need to change our business model if we were going to continue to expand our leadership position.", "We are currently in the midst of a multiyear business transformation that has touched nearly every part of our business, sales, marketing, merchandising, operations, technology, finance and business development, in order to continue the success we have enjoyed historically. We're making good progress on this journey, but that progress has not been as consistent as we would like, and there had been setbacks along the way. Driving change at this scope and magnitude is challenging.", "While a great deal of work lies ahead, I believe our strategy is sound, our execution will improve and that we are extremely well-positioned to solidify our foundation for delivering best-in-class customer service and profitable growth in the years to come.", "I want to thank all of our associates for their efforts this past year in supporting our customers. Their contributions are critical to fully realizing Sysco's vision to become our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he could provide additional details on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, sales were $11.6 billion, or an increase of 5% compared to the prior year, mainly due to acquisitions, which increased sales by 2.1% and food cost inflation, which was 2%. Case volume increased 3% for the quarter; and case volume, excluding acquisitions, increased 0.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.1%.", "Gross profit in the fourth quarter increased 1.2%, and gross margin declined 66 basis points. Roughly 1/4 of the gross margin decline was due to the shift in customer mix as a result of faster growth in sales to large, regional and national customers. The remainder of the decline was driven by the difficult sales environment during the quarter and continued competitive pressure.", "Operating expenses increased $80 million, or 5.4%, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by an $18 million increase in retirement-related expense mainly due to higher 401(k) expenses and an $18 million increase in business transformation expenses. As a result of all of these factors, operating income decreased $56 million, or 10.8%.", "Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $283 million, a decrease of $26 million, or 8.5%, compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.47, an 11.3% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items, diluted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter.", "As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which excludes certain items, as well as business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.9%, with the increase in retirement-related expense accounting for roughly 1 percentage point of the increase. Adjusted operating income decreased 7.3%. Adjusted net earnings declined 4.2%, and adjusted EPS declined 6.3% to $0.59.", "Turning to the year-over-year comparison. Sales increased 4.8%, or $2 billion, due mainly to inflation of 2.2% and acquisitions of 1.5%. Case volume increased 2.6%; and excluding acquisitions, case volume grew 1.3% for the year. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not have a meaningful impact.", "Gross profit increased 2.5% during the year, while gross margin decreased 39 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%. Approximately 1/3 of the decline was due to the shift in customer mix mentioned earlier. The remainder of decline in gross margin was due to weak restaurant traffic and competitive pressures.", "Operating expenses increased $423 million, or 7.3%, in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. The increase in operating expenses was driven by several factors: first, business transformation expenses increased $137 million; second, certain items increased $58 million, mainly due to MEPP withdrawals and restructuring items; third, payroll costs, excluding retirement-related expenses, increased $48 million, driven by acquisitions, increased volume and higher delivery costs, partially offset by lower IT and sales costs as a result of our business transformation initiatives; fourth, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding business transformation expenses, increased $36 million due mainly to facilities and fleet put into service, as well as amortization on acquired intangible assets; fifth, fuel expense increased $19 million; and lastly, retirement plan expenses increased $10 million due to higher 401(k) expense, partially offset by lower pension expense following changes on our retirement programs that became effective this year.", "With regards to the last point on retirement-related expenses, it's important to recall that we had previously estimated that the pension expense would've been more than $100 million higher this year. However, due to our retirement plan restructuring, actual pension expense was more than $30 million lower year-over-year.", "While expenses from our enhanced 401(k) plan offset this benefit somewhat, overall retirement-related expenses, which includes both pension and 401(k), increased only $10 million this year.", "Our operational focus on expense management resulted in good cost per case performance for the year. After adjusting for certain items, cost per case in our Broadline organization declined year-over-year by more than $0.03, which is very difficult to do.", "Operating income declined $232 million, or 12%, for the fiscal year. Excluding certain items, operating income declined 9%. Net earnings for fiscal 2013 decreased $129 million, or 11.5%, compared to the prior year. Fiscal 2013 EPS was $1.67, a decline of 12%. Excluding certain items, EPS was $1.78.", "To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 4.1%, adjusted operating income decreased 1.7%, adjusted net earnings grew 0.1% and adjusted EPS declined 0.5% to $2.14.", "Fiscal year 2013 has been a very active year for us in the acquisition arena, and as a result, we surpassed our stated goal of increasing sales from acquisitions by 0.5% to 1%. We completed 14 acquisitions during the year that, in the aggregate, totaled more than $1 billion in annualized sales. These acquisitions will enable us to better serve our customers, further expand our product offerings and service footprint and profitably grow our business. Each transaction has expanded our footprint in both current and new geographies, with 6 acquisitions in the U.S., 5 in Canada, 2 in Ireland and 1 in the Bahamas. They also spanned a number of different service capabilities, with 6 Broadline companies being acquired, 5 seafood specialty companies, 2 produce specialty companies and 1 systems distributor.", "Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. For the fiscal year, project expenses totaled $331 million, including $77 million in depreciation and amortization expense. We capitalized $20 million related to the project. The cash outlay on the project was $274 million, or $48 million lower than prior year. All 3 of these metrics, expense, capital and cash, were in line with the guidance we gave for the year.", "As Bill mentioned, although we continue to accelerate specific functional initiatives to advance our business transformation efforts, we plan to implement enhancements to the broader SAP platform before continuing our enterprise-wide rollout schedule. We expect our next conversion to occur around the end of the calendar year. Our rollouts scheduled beyond that time will be determined once we are able to assess the success of the additional changes and enhancements we are making to the system.", "The transformation benefits achieved this year include significantly lower pension expenses, which we expect to decline even further in fiscal 2014. After restructuring our sales and IT organization, SG&A expenses are significantly lower than the prior year. We also enhanced compliance across the organization, with existing sourcing programs. In addition, as Bill mentioned, we made substantial progress on our category management initiative and expect to see specific benefits from these efforts in fiscal '14.", "Finally, we made progress on some of our operations initiatives, including completing implementation of the SAP maintenance module, beginning the realignment of incentive plans for our driver and warehouse personnel and beginning the implementation of enhanced routing processes to reduce miles traveled.", "As you'll recall, we had stated that we would achieve approximately 25% of the total targeted benefits of $550 million to $650 million in the first year fiscal 2013. We actually exceeded our targeted business transformation benefits for the year. Unfortunately, this progress has been masked by the current difficult business environment and general operating performance of the underlying business that did not meet our expectations. As a result, we no longer expect to achieve our previous EPS guidance of $2.50 to $2.75 by fiscal '15.", "Turning to our cash flow performance. Total capital expenditures were $512 million for fiscal 2013, in line with our guidance. We made good progress on our objective to better prioritize our capital expenditures this year, enabling us to reduce our spending by $273 million compared to last year.", "We've seen a decline in capital spending related to the Business Transformation Project, mainly driven by the fact that we began implementation of the new technology earlier this year and stopped capitalizing much of the expense. In the underlying business, we've seen lower capital spending because of a reduction in the number of major facilities projects this year compared to last, and a more disciplined capital allocation and approval process. In addition, a few construction projects moved from fiscal '13 to fiscal '14.", "As a result of the reduction in capital spending and increase in operating cash flow, free cash flow increased more than 60% year-over-year to $1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion for fiscal '13 compared to $1.4 billion in the prior year.", "Now turning to fiscal 2014 guidance for a moment. Regarding our acquisition activity, we expect acquisitions to add at least 1% to our sales growth each year going forward. Due to the amount and timing of acquisitions during fiscal '13, we will exceed this goal during fiscal '14. We expect just a carryover effect of deals done during fiscal '13 to add approximately 1% to fiscal '14's sales growth. And of course, we also expect to complete new transactions in fiscal '14, which will add additional sales growth during the year.", "We believe retirement-related expenses will decrease $75 million to $85 million overall in fiscal '14 versus fiscal '13 and $50 million to $60 million net of certain items which we recognized in fiscal '13. As a reminder, the change in retirement-related expense includes the impact of our defined benefit pension plan and our defined contribution, or 401(k), plan.", "As you'll see in the chart provided in our slide presentation, the majority of the reduction in the adjusted portion of these expenses, or the portion of the expenses excluding certain items, will occur in the second half of fiscal 2014.", "We expect fuel expense for the year to increase in the range of $10 million to $20 million. We currently have about 2/3 of our anticipated fuel needs locked in at prices lower than fiscal '13. We also expect to continue our trend of strong expense management in fiscal '14, with cost per case in our Broadline companies expected to decline by $0.05, aided by the reduction in retirement-related expense.", "We expect our capital expenditures in fiscal '14 will be $550 million to $600 million, including business transformation CapEx. This is somewhat higher than our actual spend this year and the guidance we've provided earlier this year because a few projects were reprioritized and shifted from fiscal '13 to fiscal '14.", "We currently expect business transformation expenses in fiscal '14 to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million, capital spend to be in a range of $5 million to $20 million and cash outlay to be in a range of $225 million to $275 million. All 3 of these ranges are consistent with our prior long-term business transformation guidance.", "Lastly, we continue to expect the approximately $550 million to $650 million in annual business transformation benefits to be achieved in fiscal 2015. As mentioned earlier, we exceeded our goal of realizing approximately 25% of the total benefit during fiscal '13. This increases our confidence in achieving our long-term guidance, which is to deliver a cumulative benefit of approximately 50% to 70% of the total targeted benefits in fiscal '14 and 100% of those benefits in fiscal '15.", "In closing, while we have seen recent positive developments in the overall economy, the recovery continues to be modest. We believe that, as a result, consumers had not yet fully recovered from the economic downturn. The foodservice industry is continuing to feel these effects, seen in generally low growth and strange traffic patterns.", "While our financial results reflect these challenges, we are working to improve on those elements of our business that we can control, including enhancing our product and service offering, improving our execution on the gross margin line, managing our costs, increasing our free cash flow, achieving our targeted business transformation benefits and addressing the requirements of our technology transformation in a prudent manner.", "The work we are doing will position us to take advantage of market trends, enhance our ability to grow our market share over the long term and expand our leadership position in the industry.", "With that, operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "A couple of things for you. I was just hoping maybe we could start with the guidance and the 2015 guidance not being valid. You haven't really changed much. I don't -- from a business transformation standpoint, from a cost saving standpoint, so it sounds like it's, I guess, more sort of industry-related. When you gave the guidance, things weren't great, right? So I'm just trying to figure out what the moving pieces are on the difference today. Maybe you could just sort of help us frame that.", "William J. DeLaney", "Thanks, Ed. I'll start. I'll let Chris kind of get into it in a little more specific way. Obviously, we've given that a lot of thought as well. So if you go back to the way we've presented it, we had 3 buckets, we said A plus B equals C, and with A being a view of what we felt we could continue to grow the underlying business at a steady state. And that the implied guidance there was 4% or 5% growth. And then we had the $550 million to $650 million in cost savings, both on the operations side as well as product, with the goal being to get back to what Sysco's historically been, has been a company that's been able to produce consistent earnings growth. I would say this to you, obviously, the market's been difficult, but we've had some execution challenges, as we've acknowledged here today. I think the biggest thing I would say to you is the market and just the environment itself, I think, has just proven to be a lot tougher than what we thought it was going to be. We had baked in, like I said, 4% to 5% expectation that we would be able to continue to grow the business x the transformational cost savings, and that's not the case. So sure, there's been a lot of distractions and a lot of change going on. But on the one hand, it's disappointing to pull the guidance back. On the other hand, I think it reinforces the direction we're going in, which is we have to change this business model because if we hadn't gone down this road with business transformation in the broadest sense, we'd probably be looking at flat to very modest single-digit earnings growth. So I don't want to put it all on the consumer or the economy, but clearly, this market is tougher than what we anticipated at the time we put the guidance out. I'll let Chris give you his insights.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, the only thing I'll add is unfortunately, just math, which is, as Bill said, A plus B has to equal or should equal to C. We didn't expect A to be stagnant or go backwards. And so when you lose a year on a 3-year guidance, it just means your growth rates have to be that much higher. And when I just do the math with everything we've got going on, we expect to do good things. We expect there to be improvement, but I don't expect to see enough improvement to overcome that first year. So, as I said, we don't expect to achieve it in fiscal '15.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And when you say sort of lose a year, is that kind of how we should think about setting our expectations? And from a -- I know you're not giving a number, but is it more or less kind of like a year delayed, is that how to think about it?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Ed, I'm going to go with the comment you made. We're not giving a number at this point. Look, we're -- we've been at it, doing long-term projections. There's still a tremendous amount of uncertainty in what's going on out there right now, so we're not prepared at this moment to put a new set of guidance on the table. Look, what we said a number of years ago, I think, is still true today. We're trying to set this company up for long-term sustainable growth of a certain level. We've never really said what that level is because we've got to get at least some way through this business transformation to know what we're capable of achieving. But the whole goal is to set us up for long-term sustainable growth, not to hit a particular number, but to be able to grow a certain percentage or a certain amount every single year, regardless of what goes on in the market and what we're doing. And that's where we're trying to get to. So we're reassessing what we can achieve and by when, and we'll certainly come out and talk about that probably at the next Investor Day.", "William J. DeLaney", "Ed, I would echo that. The only thing I would add to it is, we've talked about '13 being a year of transition. And as I think about it, I think you need to look at '14 as the year that we begin to turn this thing, all right? So while we are not giving you specific guidance, I think we're signaling to you that we expect to see better trends on the top line and the bottom line. We've got our challenges, certainly, on the gross margin line. We've got a lot of good things going on, we think, in expense initiatives. So we feel good about the direction, we think we'll begin to turn it here this year. But to Chris' point, we need a little more time deeper into the year to see how we start the year out, get further along on the technology deployment and the CatMan working. We hope to come back with you with a little better perspective here later in the year.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then if I could just had one follow-up on that, Bill, thinking about gross profit per case, which I know is a metric you guys care a lot about, I mean, the best way we have to look at this, right, is to just look at volume growth versus gross profit dollar growth. And this quarter, we haven't seen it at this level really kind of since we saw deflation. So I was hoping you could just maybe talk about -- you mentioned competitive pressure in the marketplace, talk a little bit more about that. What's going on from a pricing standpoint on your end of the new business that you're bringing in, and just how you get this to improve next year.", "William J. DeLaney", "Sure. So if it's okay, I'm going to really combine the last 2 quarters, I think. So if you look at the third and fourth quarter, they were more similar than they were different. Things kind of bottomed out in February, I think, in terms of the market, from our perspective, in the third quarter; it began to trend up a little bit in terms of March and April; and we saw a fair amount of softness in June in terms of restaurant numbers and that kind of thing. So again, we're talking about a very choppy market here, but the reality is we only grew our gross profit dollars 2%. So while gross profit per case is an important metric, I would say again, what I look at the most is volume and the mix of that volume, locally managed within that street and then corporate managed, and then look at gross profit dollar growth. And the reality is the first half of the year, we grew it over 3%; in the second half of the year, only 2%, or maybe even a tad less; and then cost per case. So all those go together, but those are 3 high-level metrics I would continue to look at. And as you saw, we gave you a little more color on some of those this particular earnings release. I would say, as we start out the new year, there's tremendous emphasis within the company on that top line. I mean, you can grow your gross profit dollars in a lot of ways. So right now, we're very focused on the top line. We're focused on reenergizing our local and street sales growth, while still maintaining very strong corporate managed -- some of those high-volume chain business. So we need to keep the top line going in order to leverage the business. We need to drive our category management very effectively. We're off to a good start and it's early. We've got some other things that we're working on that we think over time, not so much this year, but in subsequent years, can help us mitigate some of the margin pressure. And we need to continue to look at the cost structure of the company. So again, I think you'll see gradual improvement this year. And to Chris' point and my point, I think we'll create the foundation for that to become more consistent in the years to come.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Bill, a couple of things with regard to pricing. So it looks like things got a bit worse this quarter. Was that -- do you find your investments, are they more proactive or reactive? And then maybe talk a little bit about analytics and ROI, because I always hit you guys on price elasticity. Did not look like a good ROI this quarter, how can you manage that better and maybe not make some price investments that are not productive? So that's kind of the big question.", "William J. DeLaney", "So, John, when you say ROI, you're talking about the ROI as it relates to pricing? Is that what you're getting at?", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, so when I think about it, you gave up 66 bps, and what you got back for it, it doesn't look like you got back what you'd like for it.", "William J. DeLaney", "No, we didn't. I mean, that's very fair, we didn't. And again, I would just repeat what I said a moment ago that, that has not escaped us. And we thought we were beginning to make some progress, but as the quarter unfolded, June in particular, we fell back there. So the way we're structured today, John, there's 2 ways to go at it. One is to continue to standardize and centralize more and more of what we're doing in terms of how we source the product, how we work through category management, how we create [ph] transfer pricing within the company to give our operating companies and our sales people as true a cost as we can and as competitive a cost as we can to price off of over time. Driving out these initial waves in category management will help us a great deal. And as I just alluded to, there are some other things we just need to do over time, very early days, very early exploratory work, where we need to bring more consistency to how we price. Not take pricing -- so think about it this way. A little under half of our revenue stream is priced by our marketing associates, so they have a fair amount of latitude there. And we want that because they're dealing with different customers at different points in time with different priorities, so we don't want to overly limit their latitude. At the same time, if you could see what we see, which I'm not going to let you see totally, there's a fair amount of volatility in those -- in that pricing that doesn't need to be there. And so I think not so much this year but over the next 2 to 3 years, we have an opportunity to standardize that with some things like scientific pricing, I will use that term for today, but there's other things as well. And so the idea would be to take some of the volatility out of the pricing, have more consistency, but still position that marketing associate to adapt to the needs of the customer locally. We don't want to move away from that because that is our bread and butter, and that really is part of how we think we differentiate ourselves. But no doubt about it, tough quarter, tough couple of quarters, and we're just going to have to dig ourselves out of it. And as I mentioned in my script, I think that gradually, you'll see the trends improve. And look, the bottom line here, John, is we need to do all that and continue to grow the top line and take cost out of the business.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Do you think the MA pricing volatility, is that more then being reactionary or proactive? And how good a visibility do you think they have into their competitors' pricing?", "William J. DeLaney", "I don't know that much about the latter. Certainly, most of the accounts they call on are probably -- use probably 2 or 3 other competitors, so I certainly -- they certainly have some sense of it depending on the Items, obviously, the more competitive items. I don't know that it's proactive or reactive. What I'm getting at is not so much the volatility with a given MA, although there's some of that. What I'm talking about is the volatility -- or the variability, maybe is a better word, between MAs, between OpCos and similar items, and that just comes from having 7,000 different people pricing. So we need to strike a better balance between that variability but still being responsive to the needs of the individual customer. And we will, but it's going to take some time.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then lastly, on category management, do you think -- is one of the thrusts here going to be fewer SKUs, you buying -- giving more volume to certain vendors plus your costs going down and your ability to take pricing down along with that. Is that a key thrust to you or is that secondary?", "William J. DeLaney", "I wouldn't say it's secondary. I'd say it's in tandem with a broader goal. There's different ways to go at this and different people call category management or define category management in different ways. We've taken a more deliberate, what we think very thorough approach, which starts with gaining insights from our customers, from our suppliers in terms of what the needs are in the market, what the trends are in the market, and using that as an opportunity to not just eliminate SKUs but to create new SKUs as well. So certainly, there will be a SKU reduction aspect to it but that should be more of a benefit as opposed to a targeted goal as we position our inventory to be more in sync with what the marketplace demands. And then as you go through that, that should allow us to grow more effectively with our customers, bring more innovation to the work itself, address some of these trends more effectively, that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And certainly, along the way, when you're able to identify those supplier partners who want to make the commitment to go down that road with you, you're able to identify shared savings that are good for both us, the supplier and the customer. So it's all of the above, John. To do this just to save money for 1 year or 2 is not enough. We need to do it, don't get me wrong. It's part of our cost savings initiative, but we need to do it in a way that we can grow the business over time as well.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I would like to chat about cash flow. You did increase your free cash flow this year, but you also increased your spending on acquisitions, which was clearly a driver of revenues. So I'm just wondering about one of the benefits in the fourth quarter was working capital. How long do you think that lasts? What kind of -- what were the drivers of the better working capital? And is it a concern at all that if you take out of free cash flow, the dividend and the acquisition costs, you really were almost flat here, actually slightly negative, I think. So first, working capital and then the overall thoughts about cash flow.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, I'll start in your order. So on working capital, we did see some improvement in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, just looking at it year-over-year, it was actually pretty close to flat for the same type of discussion we've had before. Our trends prior to the end of the year, we're going the wrong direction. Said another way, accounts receivable and inventory, we're going the wrong direction. We were making up for some but not all of that with accounts payable efforts. At the -- by the time we got to the end of the fourth quarter, we had balanced it out. And I believe working capital was a positive of only about $10 million at the end of the year. So working capital wasn't a significant driver on a year-over-year basis. And Meredith, I don't spend a tremendous amount of time looking at the quarters because there's seasonality in those numbers for working capital from one quarter to the next. But year-over-year, it was basically flat. Your -- second part of your question, do I have concerns about free cash flow being able to support dividend and acquisitions? I look at it differently. Acquisitions, we're actually adding EBITDA. As we bring those acquisitions then and we integrate them with the company early in the standalones whatever they are, they generate additional cash flow, which supports additional debt if we want to maintain the same debt to equity and debt ratios, if you will. Said another way, unless we're planning to continually reduce debt over time, we actually have the ability to leverage against acquisitions. So I look at acquisitions as being something we can buy with cash, we can borrow money, that's more of a financing discussion. That's why free cash flow doesn't take a deduction for acquisitions because you're actually buying new cash flows into the future.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's fair. Maybe you just talk a little bit then about buybacks. It doesn't look like you did much this year. And you do -- not only are you buying additional EBITDA, but you're not a very leveraged company. Is there any thought about leveraging up a bit to buy back stock?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, we have and we'll continue to look at, our capital structure to make sure that it's appropriate for where we are and our strategies, et cetera. As I've said, and Bill has said, as we've talked on these calls and at conferences, we expect to generate additional free cash flow. You've seen it this year. We'll see it as we continue into the future. And we're constantly evaluating how we're going to put that new cash flow to work. Our goal would be to find strategic opportunities for that cash to put it to work for future growth. Barring that, we've got to look at other options.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And I just had one sort of housekeeping question. You had an unusually large amount of other income, I believe, this quarter. Was there anything in there that was unusual? Or should we expect a higher run rate of other income going forward?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Now the only thing in there that was different, if you will, is we had an equity investment in a small company, HotSchedules, which we divested, and that was a gain -- there was a gain on that sale of, I want to say, $6 million, $6.5 million. Other than that, it wasn't significantly different than the run rate.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Andrew Wolf with BB&T.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "I think, Bill, you mentioned that the conversion rate in the category management area was ahead of what you expected. What's driving that? Could you talk a little bit about that? Is it a price offer? Or is it sort of take it or leave it because you're taking out SKUs. Could you just give a little color around that?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, it's not take it or leave it. And again, the SKU thing is important, but the SKU is more -- the SKU reduction is more of a byproduct of the overall process, which, again, is to find ways to grow better, share savings with our suppliers and our customers. Look, Andy, we've had some big initiatives over the years, so I think we're getting a little bit better at being more realistic early days on what our expectations should be, so we didn't assume 100% conversion here. So what we're saying to you is early days. We're pleased with the response we're seeing with our sales force and with customers. And no, it's not take it or leave it, because customers always have options. So I think all I'm saying there to you is that we're pleased, and I think it's really attributed to there's a year of work that went into this in terms of preparation, work with the suppliers, work with the customers, and, in particular, with our sales force and operating companies. So we're moving fast, as I said, and there's a lot to get done. But I think our team at SMS has done a great job preparing our people to drive this out and that showed up in our results so far.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "I didn't mean to sound so much that way, but because to me, the conversion being above plan is actually a positive. Is it fair to say -- there's a lot of 1 column quite dead SKUs but very low productivity SKUs certainly for Sysco, and that some of the challenges to maybe tell the customer why that might be also a low productivity SKU for the customer?", "William J. DeLaney", "That's absolutely right. That's exactly what the deal is, Andy, and so that's kind of the opportunity that we have with each customer, whether they're street or, say, a big contract customers to sit there and go through their assortment, look at their movement, look at ours, look at these trends and these insights that we've been talking about and then jointly, make good business decisions on how they should move forward with their assortment. And as you do that, you're doing a fairly methodical or scientific way, you identify a lot of slow moving SKUs. You also identify, believe it or not, SKUs that we don't have or that the customer doesn't stock that they should be stocking in terms of where the marketplace is. So it is a double-edged opportunity, so to speak.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "And just one follow-up. I think it's more for Chris because -- Chris, I think I heard you say there's going to be -- your plan is to have 50% to 70% of the cumulative savings you identified, the middle -- the midrange. It seems like a pretty large variance. And what kind of unknowns are around that variance? Is it more of the execution side at Sysco or with SAP? Or is it more what the dynamics of the marketplace and maybe pricing and things like that?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I'll start with the sector or the first point you made. It's not SAP, because, again, these initiatives do not rely upon the additional rollouts of the ERP system. We've tried to make that pretty clear. Yes, there are some uncertainties. So first and foremost, we're expecting a lot out of our category management initiatives. So as you'll recall, we have benefited in all 3 years from lower product cost. The first year was mainly higher compliance of sourcing. But during the first year, which we just completed, we had to ramp up all of the work that was necessary to start delivering real dollars on category management. Now we're right into the middle of that. So we're expecting a lot out of category management. We have a lot of assumptions and the models that support and justify what we think we're going to achieve. Now, we're out executing against those. So as Bill said, early weeks look good but we've got a long way to go on that one. We have additional operating initiatives, additional benefits that we expect to derive throughout the operational part of the organization. That's a lot of execution work. And so those are going to be the main headwinds, if you will. It's just a lot of execution work throughout the organization to get these things done and accomplished. The first year, I don't want to say it was easy. Nothing we did the first year was easy, especially when you're starting to play around with retirement costs and things of that nature. But there were things that were vastly within our control and we could execute on them fairly quickly. Now it's the harder stuff. It's into the trenches and doing all the down-and-dirty work to get the rest of the stuff done. So that's why we still have a fairly big range on that. I will say we gained a lot of confidence in the fact that we exceeded the first-year goals, so that certainly sets us up going in with some surplus. So we feel better about hitting that range.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Very helpful. And I just wanted to double-check my takeaway on that. I didn't hear the -- you didn't talk about pricing. It was all sort of internal and execution. So it's not like Sysco could execute fairly flawlessly, head towards the higher end of that range, and yet the market got even more competitive or stayed as competitive as it is, and some of that, let's say in category management in particular, or all of it, the whole bucket, I should say, could go into the marketplace. I'm just thinking in terms of how you're thinking about things. I know obviously, anything could happen. But just how you're thinking of that variance?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, Andy, look, I'm going to back to our A plus B equals C. I mean, the way we account for the initiatives, as you kind of have to have a starting point and you've got to challenge the teams to realize their product cost savings, or operating cost savings versus that starting point, where we thought things were going to go based upon kind of trends, et cetera. And that's how we measure them. If something goes on in the underlying business, if something goes on in the marketplace that's definitely going to impact A, and so the overall numbers, the C part of that equation, are definitely going to be impacted as well. But the way we measure the benefits has to be off of a base case, if you will. Otherwise, it's a constant moving target and I have no way to talk about those, our success in that area or our progress in that area. So, again, I'm not avoiding your question at all, but B has to be measured off of the base case. The impacts you're talking about, pricing, competitiveness in the market, et cetera are definitely going to impact A.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I think, Andy, I'll just add, and I don't want to get this thing too complicated. There are really 2 different things, as Chris points out. So we're out there, it's not just that we track it separately, we're creating the opportunity to grow and to create these product cost savings separately, we ultimately distribute those savings, the ones that -- so we share some of those with the suppliers and customers and then we keep some. And so the shared savings that we keep go out to our operating companies, but they also have a profit plan for the year as well. So they're not just going to unilaterally -- I know you're not suggesting that but I just want to be clear -- they're not just going to let that stuff leak in other than, to your and Chris' point, competitive conditions are going to be what they're going to be. So there's the pressure of the marketplace, which we need to continue to address in multiple ways, including enhancing our differentiation and everything else we've talked about earlier this morning, and then there's the savings themselves. So the way I would look at is I would look at these initiatives as being significant. I think that they can go on beyond the 2015. I think that's a big opportunity for Sysco. And they certainly mitigate the pressure that we see in the marketplace.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I think they're related questions, and maybe, Bill, they -- you touched on them in your prepared remarks. Firstly, could you -- you mentioned nontraditional is more of a factor than it has been. I mean, I don't know if that's being referred to like warehouse club or an Amazon or something like that. So just kind of flesh out that statement that you made and what Sysco can do to respond to that, and then I'll have the follow-up as well.", "William J. DeLaney", "Sure, John. I think why I was doing that part of the prepared remarks was just trying to set an overall trend line over the last few years. So certainly, we're seeing group purchasing organizations have a bigger role over time. We work with a lot of them in contract business. To some extent, they are more involved in some larger street businesses today, which requires us to have a much more competitive bundle of goods and services. Certainly, the club stores and the cash and carry have made an impact, in particular, in this type of economy over the last 3 or 4 years. Amazon or Amazon-like business, we're certainly appropriately respectful of that channel and attempting to find ways that we might be able to participate in it. So that has not been that big of an impact to date, but it's all around us. We see it. We recognize it. And we're watching it very closely and, as I said, trying to identify areas where we may be able to participate. Certainly, one of the challenges with that channel was how do you do it profitably. And with our model, that's clearly very important. So those are 3 examples that we'll be talking about. And so it all comes back to us continuing to enhance our business model, perhaps over time finding the right type of acquisition opportunities that supplement our current capabilities.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And are most of your contract businesses that have franchise organizations on co-ops to date? Or is that something that you see as a risk of increasing in overall volumes?", "William J. DeLaney", "No, a lot of the big contract -- not a lot, but a few of the big contract folks we work with have their own purchasing or good purchasing organizations. And we're partnering with some of them in the large contracts. You see a lot of that in health care. We're not talking about is when it goes beyond that into some of your larger independent-type of business operators. So that's a trend that's been gradually moving over the last few years. And we combat it, but the best way to combat it, as I mentioned, is to continue to work on a very complete bundle of goods, services, pricing, all the things we're talking about. It's really -- it's somewhat disruptive but it's just another form of competition that's different than what we would've seen, say, 8 or 10 years ago. But in the end, you end up at the same place, which is this trade-off of value and price and that type of thing.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And I'll try to ask this question delicately. Sometimes, recently in the marketplace, you hear a certain marketing associate or a group of marketing associates didn't like some of the changes at Sysco made maybe to one of your competitors did something else and took some of the customers with them. So I mean, the question is with the changes how stable has your marketing associate organization been? Is it more stable now than it was, for example, 6 months ago? And I'm happy if you'd want to publicly correct me, I mean, to what extent has this really been kind of an issue that's been happening within the organization?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. So let me give you some context. I think in a normal year, we would have about 15% turnover of marketing associates, and that's considered good and that's what you want. I somewhat, delicately in my prepared remarks, talked about reducing unprofitable territories. So we are down significantly more marketing associates right now year-over-year. And that's been a trend over the last 12 months. We haven't talked a lot about it publicly because it's been gradual, and from a competitive standpoint, it didn't really make a lot of sense to talk about that stuff publicly. But I would acknowledge what you said. Certainly, when you lose people, any associates, but particularly salespeople, sales managers, and if they were to go to the competition, that does create some challenges for whatever, 3, 6, 9 months. Not all of them go to the competitions, some of them leave the industry as well. So yes, what we are trying to signal there -- and I appreciate the question, is that we initiated that change in an effort to optimize our sales force and to improve productivity. And there's a downside to that on the top line. And that's lingering here a little bit, but I think to answer your question, what I also said is we're through most of that right now. Certain operating companies dealt with it better than others. And so I think as '14 unfolds, the sales force, sales management structure, all that's beginning to stabilize and we're in a much better place than where we were 6 or 9 months ago to go forward.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Bill, I think you indicated in the past that with all of the industry headwinds and even some of the more company-specific challenges that you're dealing with, that all of those issues further justify the investment in business transformation. So I just want to ask maybe a variation -- maybe Andy's question earlier, about your confidence level on getting the projected cost savings in fiscal '14 that are supposed to offset the continued spending. I mean, clearly, pension and retirement-related expenses should be a tailwind for you. But I think the guidance you provided calls for about $200 million of incremental cost savings. So it sounds like, in response to Andy's question, that you're fairly confident about the cost reduction goal. But could you maybe discuss the different components of the incremental cost saves and how much of that you expect to get from procurement benefits specifically?", "William J. DeLaney", "I might let Chris take or dodge the second part of that. But just in general, I would agree with your initial caveat in terms of the assessment. I would say this to you: If you look at it, we call this out pretty much in our remarks in the last couple of calls. We've made very good strides on the SG&A side for all the reasons you just cited. So pension, some of the things we've done in IT, and there's been some pain along the way with that. Our folks have done a good job rolling that out, but we've had some challenges and our customers, at times, had to experience some of the downsides when you move quickly in some of those areas. Where we didn't do a particularly good job in the expense side this year was on the operations side. Right from the get-go, transportation got away from us and we actually backed up during our cost per case in operations. I think that came out on one of the slides that Neil and Shannon presented here this morning. So I think as the year goes along, the SG&A cost savings will begin to plateau out. I think you'll still see some in the early part of the year, they'll begin to plateau. And I think you'll see -- with one exception, which is the pension that Chris talked about. So if you just look at basic SG&A x pension, you'll see some in the early part of the year, I think, that will plateau out a little bit, cost per piece. I think you'll see operating cost per piece begin to improve. In fact, I think it already has begun to improve from a trend standpoint. But we're still up versus a year ago. So I think that will improve as the year goes along. And then, yes, we are looking for significantly more on the product cost savings to the category management as the year goes along as well, particularly in the, I'd say, the second 2/3 of the year.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And I think you guys indicated that you came in ahead of your expectations for fiscal '13 on the cost savings. Would it be possible to just confirm the actual number?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, we're probably not going to give out the number. Here's -- let me try to handle it this way. I'm not going to completely dodge your question, Ajay, but there is a slide in the presentation. I don't know if you've actually seen it yet. I encourage you to pull it up afterwards. It's already posted, it's Slide 14. But it's an update to what we showed you at CAGNY. And what you'll see on there is we kind of put buckets for '13, '14 and '15 on the savings we expected from each. And the '13 bucket is full, and you'll actually see that we started filling in the '14 bucket a little ways. And that represents kind of the overage. So if you want to take out your slide rule, maybe you can interpolate, I'm not encouraging you to do that, but we did deliver more than we expected in '13, and that's what we're trying to represent there. And that's why we have confidence that we'll get to our range midpoint, high-end, wherever. We'll get within the range of our goals for '14 as well. We never have broken down exactly how much the benefit is going to come in each of the areas each of the years. What we did say early on is that the $600 million, half of it roughly would be in lowering cost of goods and the other half would be in lowering cost of operations. We've also said that we got ahead in our SG&A initiatives. Our operating cost initiatives were slower to come. We were roughly on track with our category management, frankly fell behind a little bit at the end of '13, mainly because the way I track those is I assume that the benefits are going to cover the direct costs of doing that, and we had some additional consulting costs that, frankly, we didn't cover. And so we don't believe that we actually hit all of that number in '13, which was primarily sourcing, as I said a few minutes ago, not category management. So we'd cast them to make up some ground in '14 and I understand that. So as Bill said, the big things for '14, category management is going to deliver a lot and we're counting on that. But we also have a lot of operating initiatives that we're counting on similar to deliver benefit. So we talked early -- or at least I talked in my opening remarks about a $0.05 cost per case reduction, which is our expectation for the year, and that's inclusive of initiatives and everything else. That's hard to do, and the way you accomplish that is, first, offsetting the natural cost increases that come every year, which -- so we got to cover those, and then also find ways to drive that cost down. So retirement, restructuring helps doing that -- helps us do that, and then some of the stuff that we still have left to do this year in terms of routing efficiencies, warehouse, things of that nature, that's got to continue to drive those costs down. So I know that's not a lot of specifics for you, Ajay, but I want to keep it in context with the guidance that we provided you in the past.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. That was actually very helpful. I just had one final question around issues related to customer mix. I think you had mentioned that one aspect of the mix issue is your sort of end market exposure to independents. But in terms of what's mostly behind the gross margin performance, it sounded like -- Chris, like based on your prepared comments, roughly 1/4 of that decline was purely mix related, and then the rest was impacted by underlying demand from your street account customers and based on market condition. So I just wanted to ask how much of the gross margin weakness do you think is market-share driven, loss of share to other Broadline distributors? And to the extent that you're dealing with competitive headwinds to other food service distributors, I also wanted to ask if you expect any relief on competitive pressures heading into fiscal '14?", "William J. DeLaney", "Ajay, you hit a nerve there, so I'm going to start and I'll let Chris dive in. Look, I don't think we're losing any market share to other Broadline competitors, okay? We don't really know where the industry is at right now, but there's no reason to believe that this industry is growing the first 6 months of the year. So there may be some other people, some of the nontraditional ones, that are taking share from the Broadliners as a group. But on an overall basis, I would say to you we believe we're continuing to take share. I would acknowledge on the local and independent operator side, there's some markets where we're getting beat a little bit right now. But overall, I don't think we're getting beat. And I just wanted to kind of get that out there before Chris cleans this up.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "I don't know that I'm going to touch that one now. Look, Ajay, good question. There are a lot of ways that we can cut up, chop up gross margin changes year-over-year. And some of that makes sense and some, frankly, that I don't believe do make sense. All we're really trying to pull out now, because we're not trying to put a bunch of excuses out there, is mix. Because we continue to say mix is somewhat, frankly, it's not one we're going to apologize for, because as long as we continue to grow our business in all quadrants, we have the potential for mix reduction. It's not that we're disappointed that we're growing in our corporate managed sales, it's that we're not growing fast enough in our locally managed sales. So we're not really apologizing for the mix, we're just kind of cutting it out so that you all know what the impact is. I mean, similarly, the acquisitions that we've done, the vast majority of them were done right around the calendar year end. Those things typically come in at lower margins, right? And it takes a while for us to get them to our margins. So that's part of the impact. I'm not calling it out because I'm not asking to present it as an excuse. I don't have the analytics around it. But there are things like that, that impact that margin, in addition to a dozen other things we've talked about, in addition to competitive pressure, et cetera, et cetera. All we're really saying is, what we were trying to, I don't know, 8 quarters ago, delineate all the different things that are impacting gross margins, frankly, they're all in the same set of competitive pressures that we've got to continue to fight and overcome. And we're just going to call out the ones -- the one that we talked about, which is mix, which is kind of very real and that we should be able to give you more insight in as we go forward.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just a couple of questions. In terms of your comments on fiscal '14, I think the term or the wording was fiscal '14 is kind of a year where things start to turn around. Is that assuming no change in the economic environment or a slight improvement? Can you just give us a little color there?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, we would hope for slight improvement. That always helps. But no, that would assume pretty much the same environment, Karen. Maybe little bit of improvement, but what it's really geared at is just we feel we have locked in some of these cost savings that Chris referenced. We recognize that we need to continue to work on the gross margin. But we just think we're better positioned going forward today than we have been in some time. I think the cash flow performance from last year could serve as a leading indicator of the type of progress, hopefully, we can make. We'll see. But bottom line is -- I know it's hard to see sometimes when you're looking at the numbers being reported. But in this type of business, you feel things getting better before you see it, and then you see it and then it shows up in the numbers. And what we've tried to signal today's comments and Q&A, is we think we can grow the top line, we've got a lot of good things going on in acquisitions. We think we're on top of our cost structure, we'll continue to make strides there, and we need to manage the margin better. And we've got good initiatives going on there to do that.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then the next question is given that you are kind of starting to get, I guess, out of the woods in terms of this SAP implementation, wondering what your appetite might be for a larger acquisition? I mean, you've obviously demonstrated an appetite for smaller ones. But as you can kind of shift gears and maybe focus your attention on something else, do you have an appetite for larger acquisitions, if it were available?", "William J. DeLaney", "We have an appetite for larger acquisitions, the right kind of acquisitions. I would break it down into 2 different times. I mean, if there was an opportunity to do some things, say it was more adjacent or maybe different geographic markets of size, those would probably be easier for us to absorb at this point in time. If it was in our core space, I'd like to see us get further down the road on both the technology deployment and the category management. But assuming that those initiatives go well here over the next 6 to 9 months, I think we'd be in a better position operationally to absorb something like that.", "Operator", ".", "And we'll take our last question from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Question, you had mentioned in the transcript there that you've seen more attention from customers asking for fresh and natural products. And how do you really address that since you seem to be more focused on packaged and canned and products of that nature? And are you losing any share to some of the more specialty purveyors on perishables?", "William J. DeLaney", "Okay, Mark, it's Bill. Look, this is a trend that we've seen coming for quite a while. We're doing -- just as an aside, I mean, we're doing a lot of really nice things in our sustainability work, which -- I'll let you review that report, it's out there online. But in terms of the business itself, I would just remind everybody, we're a full Broadline distributor and we have several specialty companies; meat, produce, imports, et cetera, et cetera. So there's really very little product out there that we can't distribute. We work very closely both with local suppliers and farmers as we do with regional and national suppliers. So the challenge there, really in all honesty, is to identify where the demand is and the volume, and create enough volume to justify bringing the SKU in and the cost of distributing those SKUs. So it just comes down to essentially locking in on the right opportunity for the right customer, and there's no reason why we can't participate there. I will acknowledge that, that's an area that we maybe historically have not been as strong at, but I think you'll see us continue to grow there, both through our core business, as we said, and potentially, through more acquisitions, as we've made in the past.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Is the challenge there that it's really a diffuse set of expectations from the customers, you can't really hone in on a set of SKUs that works across the board?", "William J. DeLaney", "It's multiple challenges. One is that, yes. And I think -- but I think to me, frankly, the bigger challenge is just breaking down what do the words mean. So fresh is one thing, natural is another and local's a third. And so, is local better? Is it fresh? That kind of thing. So it essentially just comes down to really understanding the needs of the customer, why they are looking for that product and making sure we're all clear on what the advantages are. So some of these words tend to get co-mingled but they're all very different in terms of what they mean. So we're just trying to create as much clarity as we can with the customer, and then we can work with all types of suppliers, as I've mentioned, to be responsive there.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And on the SAP issue, what is really tied to that in terms of the cost savings? Is it accounting duplication that you'll be getting rid of? Or what things are gated there? Because you are hitting your marks and exceeding them on the cost savings to date, but there must be some things tied to the SAP that you're aiming at for the next couple of years for cost saves?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes. Once we get the full SAP platform rolled out, there will be some additional savings. Now some of it, at least some of the savings that we originally identified, we accelerated. The maintenance module is already out and installed, so we are accelerating that. The HR module will come out. We will accelerate that. What's left is going to be a few areas, one, yes, finance will be one of them. There'll be some additional labor savings out in the field as we consolidate more work into our shared services center and a few other functions. There will be some ancillary savings from having that fully rolled out and being able to fully ramp up our shared services center and get the labor arbitrage that usually comes with doing that.", "Operator", "And this does conclude today's conference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the call over to Mr. Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Neil A. Russell", "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. Today, you will hear remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 29, 2013, and in the news release issued earlier this morning, which is posted in the Investors section at sysco.com and can be found on the Sysco IR app, which can be downloaded from the iTunes App Store and Google Play.", "Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in the presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation, which can also be found in the Investors section of our website. All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volumes include total Broadline and SYGMA combined.", "[Operator Instructions]", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney", "Thanks, Neil, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported record first quarter sales of $11.7 billion, net earnings of $286 million and EPS of $0.48. Adjusting for certain items, such as severance and facility consolidations, adjusted EPS was $0.49, which is flat compared to prior year.", "Market conditions remained very challenging for our customers throughout the quarter as consumers continue to spend their disposable income in an increasingly disciplined manner, and to some degree, shift their spending to more durable goods. While these trends are not favorable to the foodservice industry, we're hopeful that they will begin to abate as we approach the new calendar year and beyond.", "Notwithstanding the challenging market conditions, we grew our sales for the quarter by nearly 6% over the prior year, with approximately 2/3 of that growth coming in the form of case volume growth. Earnings were generally in line with our expectations as strong expense management helped to offset the impact of sluggish gross profit dollar gains.", "We continue to drive solid growth with our large national and regional customer base, while sales growth with our locally managed customers remains soft. We also made good progress in several of our enterprise-wide business transformation cost-reduction initiatives, which contributed to a significant reduction in cost per case in our Broadline operations compared to last year's first quarter.", "Turning to our technology transformation. During the quarter, we installed a major scheduled update to the system which favorably impacted all 5 of our SAP-enabled operating companies. Following the implementation of these performance and functional enhancements, we generally have experienced improved performance and stability in the technology.", "Encouraged by this progress, we remain scheduled to resume our deployment rollout next week at our Boise, Idaho, operating company. Assuming the results in Boise are favorable and that we continue to make consistent strides in improving the overall technology platform, our plan is to carry out additional conversions beginning early in the new calendar year.", "We are also pleased with the progress we have made to-date on our category management initiative. We are moving forward with the process, building our capabilities and focusing on driving a new assortment based upon consumer and customer insights; and the 4 pilot categories, representing approximately $1 billion in total annual spend, went live this past summer; and we've begun to launch additional categories in wave 1, which will encompass approximately $4 billion in aggregate annual spend once it's fully rolled out.", "While results vary somewhat amongst the categories in between our operating companies, both customer conversion rates and product cost savings opportunities have generally been in line with our expectations.", "As expected, we have encountered some challenges in marketing the enhanced value of the new product assortment to certain customers. As a result, we are taking steps to improve our conversion processes so as to provide our customers with a more rewarding experience as we work through the assortment changes together.", "Specifically, we are enhancing our product and supplier selection process on the front end by working with our vendor partners and sharing best practices from our most successful operating companies and adjusting the rollout calendar where execution risk warrants. We remain confident in both the benefits that category management will provide our customers and the savings we will realize over the next few years. Accordingly, wave 2 is in the early stages of implementation and is expected to launch during the second half of our fiscal year.", "In closing, while the market environment is still very challenging for many of our customers, especially those who operate in the casual dining restaurant segment, we remain focused on the following: Creating greater value for our customers, delivering our annual business plan and driving transformational change within our company. In so doing, we expect to provide improved financial results in fiscal 2014, and we expect that year-over-year improvement will gradually build and be more pronounced in the second half of the current fiscal year.", "Reflecting on the amount of necessary change we are driving in the midst of a difficult market environment, we are most appreciative of the support and partnership we receive from approximately 425,000 customers and our more than 10,000 suppliers, as well as the tremendous commitment and contributions our 48,000 associates provide each and every day.", "Now I'll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the first quarter.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $11.7 billion or an increase of 5.7% compared to the prior year, mainly due to acquisitions, which increased sales by 2.3% and food cost inflation, which was 2.1%.", "Case volume increased 4.1% for the quarter; and case volume, excluding acquisitions, increased 1.8%. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.5%.", "Gross profit in the first quarter increased 1.8%, and gross margin declined 68 basis points to 17.63%, due mainly to continued weakness in locally managed sales, the difficult business environment and competitive pressure. In addition, sales to large regional and national customers are growing faster than local business, and this mix shift drove about 15% to 20% of the gross margin decline during the quarter.", "Operating expenses increased $36 million or 2.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of operating expenses from acquired companies, adjusted operating expenses were flat compared to the prior year. This was achieved as a result of benefits from our business transformation initiatives, as well as lower business transformation expenses.", "Business transformation expenses were lower in the first quarter by $11 million, due mainly to lower spending on third-party contractor expenses. As deployment begins to ramp back up in the second quarter and throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, expenses are expected to be similar to the prior year. As a result, we continue to expect total business transformation expenses for the year to be in the $300 million to $350 million range.", "Similar to last year, we continue to see business transformation benefits driving down operating expenses. As a result, payroll in our sales and IT departments are once again lower than the prior year, down more than $20 million combined, as are retirement-related expenses.", "I'd like to provide some additional insight on our projected retirement-related expense trends for the remainder of the year. We recorded a net $9 million decline in retirement-related expense for the quarter. This was the result of a $32 million decline in pension expense, partially offset by a $23 million increase in 401(k) expense.", "As a reminder, retirement-related expenses in the first quarter and for the remainder of the fiscal year are being impacted by the timing of changes in our retirement plan benefits implemented mid-year last year, as well as by the timing of certain related restructuring items that were recognized last year.", "We've provided a chart in our slide presentation showing our projections of the year-over-year impact of each of these items. As you will see, we continue to expect adjusted retirement-related expense for the year to be lower by $50 million to $60 million, with the majority of that decline occurring in the second half of the year.", "As a result of the benefits generated from our transformation initiatives, cost per case performance in our Broadline operations was significantly better than last year for the first quarter, declining $0.09 per case compared to the prior year. We don't anticipate maintaining this rate of improvement as we lap the point at which we began some of these initiatives last year, but we remain confident in meeting our objective of a $0.05 decline for the full fiscal year.", "So in spite of relatively weak gross profit growth, the progress we continue to make towards our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in operating income being essentially flat year-over-year.", "Net earnings for the first quarter were $286 million, a decrease of $1 million or 0.4% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.48, a $0.02 decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items, which mainly related to restructuring items, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.49.", "As we have discussed on previous calls, we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business, which excludes certain items, as well as business transformation expenses. To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 3.5%, adjusted operating income decreased 2.7% and adjusted net earnings declined 3.1%, and adjusted EPS declined 3.4% to $0.56.", "Turning to the impact of the Business Transformation Project for a moment. In the first quarter, project expenses totaled $67 million, and we capitalized $4 million related to the project. In the prior year quarter, project expenses totaled $78 million, and we capitalized $8 million related to the project.", "Free cash flow was $44 million for the first quarter, slightly lower than the prior year, mainly due to working capital performance. The first half of the year and the first quarter, in particular, are our weakest cash flow quarters and a year-over-year decline is not surprising.", "Capital expenditures totaled $136 million for the first quarter of this year compared to $156 million last year.", "In closing, while the challenging business environment in the foodservice industry continues to impact our customers and our business, we are focused on those areas of our business that we can control and are encouraged by our progress in growing our business, controlling expenses and achieving our business transformation goals.", "With that, operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just looking at case volume in general, it sounds like case volume in street accounts is very limited or low or potentially even negative. So I guess, maybe, can you talk a little bit about what you think that's a function of? Is it maybe a function of headcount reduction and MAs or just base-level attrition at the street level with your customers or maybe some response to your waves of SKU reductions? Any color there?", "William J. DeLaney", "Karen, I think you answered most of your question right there. But yes, I'll take a shot at it. I think, clearly, this macro environment continues to be difficult for our customers, and we mentioned the casual dining segment, so that's a big part of our street business, more so than maybe on the big contract side. So I think there is a macro aspect to that. Certainly, we are driving a lot of change as we've referenced here for several quarters. And any time you drive change, you do have to drive it through your sales organization, and our folks have had to deal with a lot of that over the last 12 to 15 months. Now we're getting the benefit of it on the cost side, but it has somewhat probably hurt us a little bit on the top line. It's hard for me to tell -- really, the SKU thing, you get different pieces of feedback on that. I don't think it's as much the SKU issue as it is just the amount of change, and to some extent, as we've eliminated some territories, customers are dealing with different MAs and that type of thing. So from -- I think there's a little bit on the macro, somewhat on the inside, internal, if you will, I would say, largely to be expected. We just need to work through it as fast and as well as we can. And I would just tell you, the competitive environment, in particular on the street business, remains very acute. And we need to fight to keep the cases that we have and to grow those cases. And so there's a never-ending balance here across the different markets and the different operating companies and that trade-off between retaining and growing business and pricing. And we continue to try to do that as well as we can. Obviously, it's a challenge right now.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And just a question on categories in terms of wave 1 and 2. How many categories is it going to address? I know you gave dollar amounts, but how many categories and if you could give any color on what categories will be included?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I don't think we have any finite number of categories. We continue to look, for example, at the rollout calendar. It was pretty aggressive in the front end. We've made some modest adjustments. So that could ultimately end up with maybe a couple more waves, if you will, than what we initially intended. But I think to put it in perspective, we buy about a little over $30 billion worth of product. And the pilot, we said, was about $1 billion and wave 1 is $4 billion, but wave 2 would be less than that. So I think we're getting to where it's a significant piece. By the end of the year, it will be a significant piece of our overall purchasing.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the gross margin decline of 68 basis points. You talked a little bit about mix, but maybe you could give us some other factors that played into that decline because we've now had a couple of quarters here in the mid-60s or 60s or higher on a basis points decline.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, Mark. So mix is a part of it, I think Chris mentioned it's about 25% of that reduction. The rest of it is pretty much what I was discussing there with Karen. We've got a very competitive environment out there, and we do a lot of business, it's a volume-driven business. We're the leader by far. And the most profitable business we have is the business that we're already transacting. So we're fighting very hard to hold on to those cases, and we're doing a reasonable job of that, as I said, in a challenging environment. With that said, there's things that we can do and execute better. There is some variability, as we've called out over the last 2 or 3 calls, between operating companies and how well we're executing, and we're trying to provide the right level of support to give more consistency in our performance there. So there's opportunities for us in the short to medium term to manage the margin better and still grow the business and take care of our customers, and that's what we intend to do.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "What do you mean by locally managed business was under more pressure on margin? Was that -- does that mean more street account margin pressure than the rest of the business?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, so let me address the terminologies. So over the years, it's still relative when we talk about contract and street. But as we evolve here and as our organization structure evolves, we're trying to be a little more clear on where the large amount of the accountability goes in terms of growth. And so our operating companies pretty much control 60% to 70% of the revenue stream on average. And the bulk of that is street business, but there's also contract business locally. So when I speak of locally managed business, it's what's largely managed at the operating company level, the majority being street, but there's a good percentage of local contract as well. The rest of it, we refer to as corporate managed, and that's our big national and large regional multiunit customers.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "And it sounds like that segment is where you've been getting more of your wins lately, the corporate managed business. Is that right?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. I mean, there's pressure in that segment as well, but we've done a nice job leveraging our scale there, and those customers see that as a big competitive advantage for them. So we've had some good success there actually over the last 2, 2.5 years.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "And the locally managed pressure, is that just reaction to the difficult operating environment or is it kind of planned attacks to kind of gain share in some places?", "William J. DeLaney", "I think it's a combination of all of that. I don't think there's a lot of growth right now on the street. We'll update that data here as we get into the end of the calendar year. And so I think that results in more of the same that we've seen in the last 2, 3 years. When there's not a lot of growth, that creates a lot of acute pressure on the street and that type of business, and there's a lot more people trying to do what we're trying to do, which is hold their business and grow it.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So a couple of things. Bill, you said in the 5 SAP-enabled companies, performance has significantly improved. So with respect to that, what has improved? And then, is it just operating performance or actually, is there a financial performance at those 5 companies that has meaningfully improved?", "William J. DeLaney", "John, when I speak to the favorable results that we're seeing there and the improvement we're seeing, it's more about the platform itself. We see more stability where we're utilizing the hardware better. Some of the issues we've had with replenishment, service levels, those have begun to improve as well. It's not as consistent in terms of the trend lines as we'd like to see, but it's definitely better than where we were. So it's more on the operating side and on the hardware utilization itself. And it's encouraging.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Now is that -- should that directly translate to financial performance, or is there a fair bit of a lag between when that will happen?", "William J. DeLaney", "There's still more of a lag than what we'd like to see, which is why we took this pause here to go in and basically dedicate all of our resources to enhancing the underlying system itself. So yes, it should to and obviously needs to. And we just need that dip to be less -- more shallow and last not as long. So we're not there yet, but we are feeling more confident in terms of the strides we've made, and that's why you hear us talking about beginning deployments again with our company in Idaho this month then hopefully more than that as we get into new year.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Now let me ask on gross margin, if you take mix out, maybe you're down 50 bps, give or take. How do you guys analytically look at the ROIC of that and the elasticity of that? And then, I guess, if you had spent less than the 50 bps, would case volume be significantly worse or it's a balance, but how do you analytically think about the balance whether you're getting a decent return for the 50?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I think, John, you've been very consistent on that question. Actually, I'm getting a little more perspective on the elasticity as we go through this over the last year, 1.5 years. But I would say, certainly, we're conscious of ROIC, but we tend to look at that more at the operating unit level and obviously the enterprise level. We look at the profitability of the accounts. We look at growth. I mean, ours is a business that's driven on growth. We invest in the business, we utilize our scale. We see that as a very big competitive advantage, both on the operations side and on the sales and marketing side, both with our big contract customers and locally. So our fundamental belief is that we need to grow this business. Now we need to grow it profitably. But our customers are all profitable. It's a matter of are they as profitable as they were a year ago, and we look at that. And I would tell you, 1 year, 1.5 years into trying to get better answers to your question on elasticity, I'd say it's -- I don't think I can tell you that we would have had more GP dollars if we had higher margins, let's say. And as you look at it by market or OpCo, it's a function of our leadership and our execution. It's a function of the support we're able to give them here from corporate with all the initiative work that we're doing. And it's a little bit of a function geographically on how healthy those markets are. For example, the Southwest in Texas, we're able to grow the business here a little better because the underlying market's somewhat better, middle part of the country more difficult.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then, lastly, the acquisition pipeline, do you think based on what you see today that you'll be -- again, we're going to lap some of the acquisitions you did last year so -- but if you sort of think about what you might bring on online new over the next 9 to 12 months, you think that will likely be in the 1% to 2% range contribution to sales or do you think it's less than that?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "John, this is Chris, with a bit of weak voice today, I apologize. What we said is we plan to grow at least 1% every year. We've got a lot of carryover from the deals we did last year, the annualization of what we did last year, which is going to give us 1% just on carryover. So if we do our normal 1%, of which we'll get about 0.5 point benefit this year, plus 1 point carryover, we'll be in that 1.5% range. That's kind of our target for this year. And then going forward, we still plan to do at least 1% a year. We've still got a very robust pipeline. The first quarter always seems to be a little bit weak, but we're pretty pleased with the progress we continue to make on the acquisition front.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Bill, just not to beat a dead horse here, but I want to start with a follow-up on the gross profit, and let's think about gross profit per case, I guess. How much of the pressure that you're seeing right now is from new business pricing or is it just -- or is it renewals of existing contracts?", "William J. DeLaney", "Are you just asking about the contract business or are you asking about all customers?", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Your whole business. How much of it is pressure on existing customers versus going out and trying to win new customers?", "William J. DeLaney", "I'd say it's more on the existing customers. They're all looking to find ways to save money and run their businesses better. And as we've alluded to here and spoken to, the environment for many of our customers, especially on the restaurant casual dining side, remains very challenging. So we're always in conversations, whether it's street business or larger-chain business, trying to find ways to share savings and to provide them more value. So given the math, it's definitely more on the existing business. We could be doing better on the new business, I'll tell you that. So I think that's in a left-handed way kind of a testimony to the fact that we're not just chasing business to get a top line. So I'd like to see our new business numbers be a little bit higher right now, and I expect that they will pick up here as things start to stabilize with the sales force. But I would have to say it's mostly on the existing business.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on gross profit per case, generally. Obviously, it's a little weak right now. It sounds like you expect it to get better as the year progresses. So first, I guess, is that true? And do you think you can get back to the point at some time this year where you have flat-ish to maybe modestly positive gross profit dollars per case?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, we tend to speak about gross profit more in terms of percentages, so I'm going to leave it there. I will say this, we need to improve, I think that's clear. I mean, if you look at the quarter, the way I would characterize the quarter is the top line number was good. We would've liked to seen a better number on the locally managed street business than what we saw, and that drives some of the margin as well. So we need to do better there. I don't know that we can get all the way back to flat by the end of the year, but certainly, we can -- I feel like we can make some improvements and we need to. The good news here is that the cost per case, we are seeing the benefits of a lot of the initiatives we've undertaken here over the last 12 to 15 months, and there's more to come there. And they do go together at some point, especially on your big contract business. Your -- as that business grows somewhat faster than your street, you need to see lower cost per case than your expenses because that's part of the economics on how you go after that business. So our target is to obviously improve the gross margin performance. I'm probably not prepared today to tell you we're going to get back to flat.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "All right. And then just last question for you. Category management, can you just maybe provide a little bit of color on what your clients actually are saying at this point, specific pushback, how you're adjusting to that? And then as you think about what you've rolled out so far, what's been the sales and the gross profit dollar impact so far on those categories?", "William J. DeLaney", "I would say, generally, 2 things, one is that the customers have been incredibly supportive. They're looking at this with an open mind. Our sales force is -- they've got a lot coming at them. They've done a nice job in our sales management. We've done, I think, a very good job bulking up and strengthening our merchandising team throughout the company, but especially here at corporate. We put a lot of planning, a lot of thought into this. So we've learned a lot over the last few years from big initiatives that there's things we need to do in terms of bringing folks in and better preparation, better communication. With all of that said, we can still communicate better between here and our operating companies. There's probably some process improvements in terms of how we manage the conversions at the operating company level that we need to get better consistency on amongst the different companies, and that's an opportunity obviously for us to work better with them. The suppliers give us good feedback as we get into some of the individual categories and which ones will be more complicated than others, that type of thing. So right now, I would just say to you that from a process standpoint, we're about where we thought we would be. We're doing fine on the conversions. But the reality is, it somewhat depends on the category and it depends on the customer and it depends how good a job we did in terms of comping the specs on the individual items. And so it's a one-on-one conversation with each and every customer. And we're just trying to strike the right balance between moving forward and doing the right thing for the customer but also the right thing for our economics. And at times, we probably have moved a little too fast there and we just need to be a little bit more patient at times and give our people a little more support to do that. But all in all, I'm pleased with where we're at. That's a big initiative. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we still feel very good about it going forward.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Ivan Holman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is Ivan Holman sitting in for Michael. I was hoping to dig into the guidance a little bit. You mentioned that you expected trends to improve and profitability to build as 2014 continues. And since there are a lot of moving pieces, I was wondering, is that predicated on an improvement in the macro? And excluding an improvement in the macro, do you still think that you can continue to build there through the initiatives that you're rolling out?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, yes, it's predicated on some improvement in the macro. If you recall, if you look at our year last year, on a relative basis, the first half of the year was much stronger than the second half of the year. And so there is some presumption there that the macro will gradually improve. But we're not waiting on that. So it's hard for me to kind of gauge how much improvement we'll make with or without the macro. But we certainly expect to grow the business. If the macro improves, we'll grow it a little bit more. We expect that we'll continue to make strides on margin and cost management. I think the components of the improvement on cost control will change over the course of the year, and Chris can take you through that a little bit. But we -- the bottom line is here we expect to improve, but certainly, an improving macro would give us more confidence.", "Ivan Holman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And just a quick follow-up. With regards to acquisitions, can you just help us understand from a process perspective, given the erosion in gross margins from the mix shift towards the locally managed business, can you help us understand when you're looking at acquisitions, if there are any constraints around that in terms of decisions to grow the top line but perhaps at the expense of gross margin, and how you view the evolution of the business as you look at acquisitions on a go-forward basis?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, let me say this. The way we look at acquisitions is we're looking for opportunities to bring businesses in this company that will help us grow. That may be geographic, it may be a product category, it may be -- it may not be necessarily a top line opportunity, could be a consolidation play. So it just depends on the specific opportunity we're looking at it. If you look at our acquisitions over the last 1.5 years or 2 years, we've done all of that. We bought a company up in Western Minnesota, which, believe it or not, gave us some green space up there even though we're in Minnesota, we're in North Dakota. We've bought some specialty product companies, European Imports comes to mind. And we've entered into some new geographies in Qu\u00e9bec and the Bahamas and Ireland. So we look at everything there. And we're certainly -- as you look forward, it's certainly a meaningful part of how we expect to grow the top line. But in the end, it needs to be profitable as well. Chris, you want to add anything to that?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, I'm not sure we fully understood the premise of your question, but I think Bill's explanation is good. We do all sorts of different types of acquisition. Generally, the margins that we see in the company before we acquire it are lower than our own margins. And so it might be a bit dilutive when we first merge it in with our existing business. But then that yields the opportunities that we have with these acquisitions to put them into our buying programs to enhance their performance, especially if it's a fold-in and get cost savings out of it. So we might see a bit of a dilution initially, but then we see synergies, if you will, as we operate it for a period of time and bring it into the fold. So we believe these -- especially the smaller acquisitions that we've been doing, and they're not all tiny, but small-, medium-size acquisitions are very beneficial to us both in growing the top line but also in continuing to enhance our profitability over time.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I'd like to kind of connect 2 things you've been talking about and we'll see if there is a connection. You were talking about category management and maybe you got some pushback from some customers. Do you think there's any relationship with pricing? You did say pricing to existing customers had come down. Is there any relationship between that and your category management efforts or is it separate?", "William J. DeLaney", "Meredith, I think what I acknowledged is that we can do better on gross margins, and we're working hard on that. I would say, on CatMan in particular, the type of conversations we're having with customers would be generally expected when you're sitting there, talking to them about, in certain instances, changing out an item. I wouldn't call it so much as pushback as it's just people want to know why it's good for them and that type of thing. So I would say, overall, in terms of the profitability on the CatMan, it's been as good or better than we expect. So that really hasn't been the issue there. It's just we need to do it in the right way to sustain the growth that comes from that. And the way we're approaching category management, it's -- clearly, we need to realize the gross savings and invest in that in the right way and create the net savings we've spoken about. But our whole goal here is to do this in a way, and we're doing it in a very well thought-out way, to sustain growth over the next 2 or 3 years as well and hopefully accelerate growth. So it's more of a growth issue than it is a profitability issue, I would say.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then I have a question about marketing associates. I think you mentioned that there had been some declines. And could you just spell out -- I know you had done some layoffs or allowed attrition to happen. Have you also had some defections? And would you say that whatever impact that has on sales is behind you or will there be some over -- future spillover effect?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. If you go back, let's go back 15 months. And so as we started rolling out a lot of these initiatives, on the sales side, we had several key initiatives. We implemented a CRM tool across the company. We looked at creating more consistent pay plan across the company, different variables but more consistency in terms on how the commission grid works. We flattened the sales organization. Where it made sense, we tried to take layers out or at least make sure that our best and most talented sales associates and sales management are as close to the customer as possible, and we looked at nonprofitable territories. So yes, we're down in terms of territories year-over-year. That rate of decline has plateaued out to some extent. And I would say this, it's -- part of it was very conscious, part of it, we've lost a handful or 2 of people in management probably that we wouldn't wanted to have lost, and I'm sure we've lost some MAs that we wouldn't have wanted to lost. And when we didn't execute well in a few companies, we lost more people than I would've liked to seen us do. But all in all, for something of that magnitude, I think we've executed reasonably well. And to your last question, yes, things have begun to stabilize. The change that Sysco is going through today, becoming much more customer-centric and we're having to accept the fact that change is perpetual. So it's not like the sales force isn't going to have change going forward. It's not like the customers are not going to see some change. The degree of change, I think, has stabilized and I think we will see some improvement there as people get more confident in the new organization structure and what their roles are and that type of thing. So absolutely in a better place from that standpoint than we were a year ago.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And I'd just like to throw in one more question. This quarter, you did buy back stock and it looked like you were a net borrower to buy back stock. I was just wondering if this -- I kind of went back and looked and I think that the share count went down a bit more than it has recently. Is there anything in that? Is that a part of a plan or it just worked out that way?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Meredith, this is Chris. It's no change in our strategy, just to be candid and upfront about it. We typically -- periodically, every quarter, we look at what's the expected dilution from options, issuance options, exercises, et cetera. We try to look as far ahead as possible, and then we try to put in place a plan to offset that with stock repurchases. We got a bit ahead in the first quarter due to pricing and due to some modeling that we did. And so that's what you see is a pretty strong first quarter. Depending on where the stock goes and what happens with option exercises, we'll determine whether we continue to buy at a similar clip or a much less clip. But it is not a change in strategy.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Chris, you mentioned -- I just want to make sure, you said the cost per case was $0.09 lower this quarter but you expect $0.05 for the year. And could you just kind of give me more information about that? It seems like a really strong number this quarter. And is that all having to do with hiring in the warehouse or in other parts of the company?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No. As we've talked about over the last couple of quarters, and I think we're starting to give a little more insight into the amounts and the magnitudes, it's really a continuation of the initiatives that we began last year. So we saw significant declines in our sales cost per case, offset by some increases on the warehouse and driver side. And so what we're really saying is as a first -- well, first, we put out guidance for the year that we expect to be down $0.05 a case. The first quarter, we're down pretty heavily but we're going to wrap that as we get into the latter half of the year because we started some of those initiatives in the latter half of last year. So as we wrap it, we won't see as much of a decline. We're very confident we'll see our $0.05 a case for the year, and I hope we'll do better than that and then we've got to continue with additional initiatives to continue to drive down that cost per case as much as we can. And first, to offset any increases that are somewhat natural year-to-year; and secondly, hopefully, actually drive down the absolute number.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "And is any of the overhead cost reduction part of that, like the lower pension expense, or is it all sort of variable costs?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, it is, Andy, and the reason I don't call it out is that it hits multiple line items when we talk about the retirement-related expenses. On a cost per case basis, they hit the sales line, they hit the operations line. They hit multiple lines because it's a labor expense. But yes, that is part of the decline in multiple areas.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Just wanted to understand it because the variance, it's big numbers. Second, on the table in the release that has the MA-served sales as a percent of Broadline, the year-ago figure is about almost 90 bps or so lower than what's in the press release a year ago. Is that a number that gets routinely adjusted, or is that in any way related to the re-class?", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, Andy, to be honest, I didn't look at it. I don't think it would be related to the re-class. We'll take a look at that and come back to you with an answer. I don't know the answer off the top of my head.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate it. The reason I asked that is if it is adjusted the way -- if I were to carry through the same 90 bps change, it would actually look like your MA-served business as a mix -- on a mix basis, actually, kind of improved from the fourth quarter. But that doesn't sound like what you're all saying around...", "Robert C. Kreidler", "No, that should not be the implication [indiscernible]. So let us check.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It seems like with the gross margin decline, it almost feels like there's a war of attrition that's kind of out there in the overall marketplace, with everyone having to take gross margin down because the next person is and what have you. So I mean, could you kind of comment, I mean, if that's something that's happening, if you might be losing share to on the street account basis? And I know it's a very hard question to answer, but how long it could continue? How long can your competition continue to invest in price if they don't have the cash flow and the balance sheet and the margins that you have to start with?", "William J. DeLaney", "Well, those are great questions, John. I'll take a shot at it. I would say it's -- I don't know if it's a war of attrition. It's just a very acute competitive environment. And I know I'm repeating myself at this point, where I don't believe that there actually is a lot of overall growth on the street right now. And if you're Sysco, first of all, let me be clear, we need to do better managing margin. And we've got some things we're working on and continue to work on in the short term. And over the medium term, there will be some other opportunities, I think, for us to mitigate some of this pressure. But from our standpoint, it does come back to scale, it does come back to looking at that in the context of expense improvements as well. And we're just not going to give up cases unless we're doing something really ridiculous. And in that case, we will transition the business. So it's not an environment where we want to give up cases. As far as what the other guys are doing, we've acknowledged over the last couple of years that the nature of the competition continues to evolve so we continue to have a lot of traditional competitors, large, medium and small. I think the nature of this business is, if you don't -- if you're not looking to grow and expand, you can generate cash and stay in business for a while. I think there's a fair amount of people leaving and you see that, I think, in our acquisition pipeline picking up somewhat. At the same time, the barriers to entry are relatively low, so there continues to be a lot of small players out there. And then we have the nontraditional folks that I think are doing well in this type of environment, the cash and carries and the club stores and that type of thing. So those are all part of the environment that we're in right now. And on a day-to-day basis, we're marketing. It is our ability to sit and work with customers and help them plan their menus better, help their -- work with their waitstaff, manage their costs better. As they get larger in scale, manage their freight better, anything we can do to help them run their business more effectively. So at any given point in time, that's going to resonate at different levels with different customers. So we think we have a clear advantage there, and we certainly think that our approach strategically is the right approach. I think we're very customer-centric model, very much about working closely with our customers, our suppliers, gaining better insights, operational excellence, acquisitions to grow the top line, developing our people. But at the same time, we have room for improvement and that's, I think, I'll acknowledge as well that we do need to continue to find ways to strike a better balance between growth and margin, and we will.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And a little bit separately, if I may. We don't talk a lot about SYGMA on these conference calls. But is there like some really big opportunity that's out there on the chain account side that maybe we haven't seen you convert in the last couple of years?", "William J. DeLaney", "We had a pretty good run with SYGMA for about 2 years, and we did pick up some business over the last few months. And I think you saw that on the top line this quarter. When you do pick up business, it can create some expense issues and transitions, so we had some earnings pressure there as well. So we've got a nice stable of customers in SYGMA, and we're working very hard to continue to do good by them and then to solidify those relationships and grow within those relationships. But certainly, we have some key prospects out there as well. And SYGMA, it's a $6 billion business. We make about 1%. But it represents a big part of the opportunity in our market, and it's just important that we balance the growth there.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And the final question for me, it's a quick one. What's kind of the inflation/deflation outlook as you see it maybe over the next 6 to 12 months?", "William J. DeLaney", "I would say, again, a very slight category. Certainly, your commodities are going to be up and down and that type of thing. But right now, the best information we have is probably more of the same. It's hung in there in the relatively low 2s. And as I sit here this morning, I don't really have anything to tell you that would cause that to go up appreciably over the next 6, 9 months.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "Yes, the only thing that we get, which I'm sure you guys get the same report, is there are certain categories be, for example, where we continue to see some inflation. But Bill's right, overall food prices just don't seem to be going up and the forecast is not for them to go up.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And that was actually kind of the point of the question is whether the rate of inflation could actually drop to the point where there'd be almost no inflation in the model.", "Robert C. Kreidler", "We're not reading that in any of the expert reports. We see that it might be a tad lower than last year on a whole, but we're not seeing anybody writing about deflation.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation.

Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today.", "This morning Sysco reported second quarter sales of $11.2 billion, the net earnings of $211 million. Adjusted EPS excluding certain items was $0.40 for the quarter, which was flat compared to the prior year.", "Market conditions continued to be challenging for many of our customers and competitive pressure remains acute. These conditions were amplified in December by a shortened holiday shopping season and severe weather in several areas of the country. The casual dining restaurant segment was especially impacted experiencing flat year-over-year sales during the quarter as high average check amounts could only offset the impact of declining traffic.", "Notwithstanding the ongoing challenging market conditions, we grew our sales 4% over the prior year in the second quarter through both case volume growth and acquisitions. We continued to drive solid growth through our large national and regional customers, while our business for locally managed customers remained soft.", "We are seeing reasonably strong growth with locally managed customers in our Southwest market, while underlying market conditions are particularly difficult in our Northeast and Mid-East markets. Operating income fell short of our expectations for the quarter.", "Expense management was strong once again this quarter is evidenced by cost per case in our Broadline business being significantly lower than the prior year, but sluggish sales growth with our locally managed customers and ongoing gross margin pressure more than offset those gains.", "We have implemented several short-term actions steps and longer term strategic initiatives to both accelerate our locally managed sales growth and mitigate the ongoing gross margin pressures that we have experienced in recent quarters. These actions are gaining traction within our company and we are targeting gradual improvement in these areas through the balance of calendar year 2014 and beyond. At the same time, we anticipate our expense management performance will remain solid as we make additional progress in our productivity improvements and operations over the next several months. While the year-over-year over benefits of our SG&A cost reduction initiatives begin to plateau.", "In summary, calendar year 2013 was one of the most difficult years in recent history for our industry and we struggle to leverage our sales growth. While weather conditions have been quite severe thus far this quarter, we believe the market conditions will improve nicely in calendar year 2014 and then Sysco's operating performance results will show steady improvement as well.", "Turning to our technology transformation, as we discussed last quarter, our teams have invested significant effort to prepare needed updates to the SAP software to improve both stability and scalability. Last October, we implement performance enhancement that meaningfully improve system capacity utilization as well as functional enhancements and improved order management and other processes. Encouraged by the success of these changes, we resumed our deployment rollout at our Boise, Idaho operating company back in November.", "System performance in Boise was favorable upon Goliath and in a weak sense. And importantly, the recently implemented system enhancements have successfully addressed challenges that have previously impacted our large regional and national contract customers. This success provided us the confidence to convert two additional locations Phoenix and Las Vegas at the end of January. These deployments are an important test to both the stability of our SAP solution and our ability to successfully deploy multiple larger size OPCOs simultaneously. But, we are pleased with our progress over the last year, we are working hard to further optimize our SAP solution in the days ahead.", "In February, additional updates are scheduled to be implemented that are intended to further improve system stability and scalability. These changes include simplification of the dynamic pricing and purchase order processes. While we continue to monitor progress in the eight facilities now live on the SAP platform as well as performance following the enhancement schedule to take place later this month.", "Excuse me, let me say it again. While we continue to monitor progress in the eight facilities now live in the SAP platform as well as performance following the enhancement schedule to take place later this month depending upon success of these next important steps, we would expect to launch two additional facilities by the end of the fiscal year.", "We also continue to move forward with our category management initiative. The majority of wave 1 categories have now been launched and we expect the wave 2 categories to launch during the second half of fiscal 2014.", "We are applying learnings to the process as we move forward and have seen some improvement in execution and performance recently. We will continue to monitor performance in these categories and remain confident in both the benefits that category management provide our customers and the savings we will revise over the next few years.", "We also have multiple initiatives underway targeted at lowering operating cost. While we have previously discussed extensively the SG&A cost reduction initiatives, we also have several efforts underway to reduce cost and improved productivity in our warehouse and delivery operations.", "Broadening optimization initiatives are underway in several of our largest operating companies. We expect to implement in the coming weeks a new warehouse scorecard to drive enhanced performance and accountability and are developing a similar scorecard for delivery operations.", "Our consolidated parts procurement program has been implemented across the entire United States. We have negotiated a universal contract to procure forklift equipment resulting in significant savings on this category equipment. And we also have undertaken an initiative to right-size our fleet. To-date we have identified 700 pieces of equipment to eliminate and expecting to complete a total elimination of 1500 pieces of equipment. This will reduce our maintenance cost, title on registration expenses, ongoing capital requirements and optimize our overall fleet age.", "Turning briefly to an update on the proposed merger with the U.S. Foods, last month we announced several key decisions regarding the integration planning leadership structure. We have formed a steering committee, which I will chair and is comprised of a joint team, the senior executives for both Sysco and U.S. Foods. The role of the steering committee will be to oversee the integration planning work and approve key decisions.", "Chris Kreidler has been appointed to lead the integration planning work. Because of his strong business and financial capabilities, Chris is well-suited to provide the leadership, valuable skills and perspective that will be required to successfully bring both companies together. In addition to his integration planning leadership responsibilities, Chris will continue in his current role as Chief Financial Officer.", "The integration planning process will consist of four major tracks of order, Greg Bertrand, Senior Vice President of Foodservice Operations has been appointed to lead the sales, merchandising and operations integration planning tracks. And David Schreibman, U.S. Foods Executive Vice President of Strategy will lead the corporate functions integration planning track.", "We are moving forward quickly along the path of planning for eventual integration and Chris will provide more details on our progress in a few moments.", "In closing, these are both exciting and challenging times for Sysco. We are beginning to see many of our transformational changes take hold and we now look forward to the U.S. Foods merger as the next step in our transformation. Enhancing our ability to serve our customers, strength and supply our partnerships and further engage our employees.", "Sysco is unique in its ability to make these types of significant investments which we believe will create a compelling opportunity over time for all stakeholders. We are focused on driving out this change in a manner that contributes to the success of our customers and suppliers and we appreciate the dedication of our Sysco employees.", "Now, I will turn things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter as well as the merger and integration planning work.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thanks Bill, and good morning, everyone.", "For the second quarter sales were $11.2 billion or an increase of 4.1% compared to the prior year mainly due to case volume growth about half of which came from acquisitions. Case volume increased 4.3% for the quarter and case volume excluding acquisitions increased 2.7%. Inflation increased sales 0.8% and changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.6%.", "Gross margin in the second quarter increased 0.7% and gross margin declined 60 basis points to 17.48%, due mainly to continued weakness in locally managed sales, the difficult business environment and competitive pressures. In addition, sales to large regional and national customers are growing faster than local business and this mix shift drove about one-quarter of the gross margin decline during the quarter.", "Operating expenses increased $44 million or 2.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year period. Approximately $30 million of this year-over-year variance was driven by operating expense from acquired companies. In addition, certain items totaled $33 million during the quarter an increase of $12 million over the same quarter last year.", "Certain items this quarter included a $24 million increase in the estimate for Sysco's self-insurance reserve of $4 million or $4 million in merger related costs and $5 million in other restructuring cost. If we exclude certain items and the impact of acquisitions, operating expenses were flat year-over-year.", "Business transformation expenses were lower in the second quarter compared to last year by $18 million and are lowered by $29 million for the first half of the year. However, expenses in the second half of the fiscal year are expected to be similar to the prior year, as a result we continue to expect total business transformation expenses for the year to be inline with our guidance of $300 million to $350 million, albeit at the lower end of that range. Similar to last year, we continued to see business transformation benefits driving down our operating expenses, mainly in the areas of sales, IT and retirement related expenses. And we expect benefits from category management and operation initiatives to build as we move forward.", "As a result of the benefits generated from our transformation initiatives cost per case performance in our Broadline operation was significantly better than last year's second quarter declining $0.11 compared to the prior year. For the first half of the year cost per case declined $0.10 compared to the prior year. As we discussed last quarter, we don't anticipate maintaining this rate of improvement as we lapped the point at which we began some of these initiatives last year but we remain confident in meeting or exceeding our objective of $0.05 decline for the full fiscal year.", "In spite of the continued progress on our business transformation initiatives, continued weakness in the underlying business resulted in a decline in operating income of 8.1% year-over-year. Net earnings for the second quarter were $211 million, a decrease of $11 million or 4.8% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.36 a 5.3% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items which mainly related to an increase in estimated self insurance reserves diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.40 which was flat compared to the prior year.", "As we have discussed on previous calls we believe it is important to focus on the performance of our underlying business which excludes certain items as well as business transformation expenses.", "To summarize the performance of our underlying business, adjusted operating expenses increased 3.4%, adjusted operating income decreased 7.6%, adjusted net earnings declined 4.4% and adjusted EPS declined 4.1% to $0.47.", "One housekeeping item to mention, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 Sysco changed its classification of certain inter-company purchases related to our FreshPoint and meat companies from the previous classification used in fiscal 2013. This change impacted gross profit and operating expense that had no impact on operating income or net earnings. In our press release this morning you will find a table showing the impact of these reclassifications to prior year results for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012.", "Turning to the impact of the business transformation project for a moment, in the second quarter project expenses totaled $63 million and we capitalized $10 million related to the project. We expect to maintain this level of capital spending in the third and fourth quarters due to ongoing work to enhance the stability and scalability of the system. As a result, we expect total capital spending related to business transformation to be $30 million to $40 million for fiscal year 2014, this is an update to our previous guidance.", "Total capital expenditures were $135 million for the second quarter this year compared to $106 million last year. We continue to expect total capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million for the fiscal 2014 year. However, after including anticipated proceed from asset sales, net capital spending will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Free cash flow was $167 million for the quarter increasing substantially over the prior year period mainly due to improvements in working capital performance. For the first half of the year free cash flow increased 64% to $211 million.", "Now I'd like to turn for a few minutes to a discussion of our proposed merger with U.S. Foods. In December, we announced our plan to merge with U.S. Foods in a cash and stock deal valued at $8.2 billion. This is an extremely important and exciting combination that we anticipate will generate at least $600 million in synergies over three to four years. As Bill motioned last month we announced the steering committee has been formed comprised of a joint team of senior executives from both Sysco and U.S. Foods and the integration planning leadership had been determined.", "Our integration planning team is comprised of leaders from both Sysco and U.S. Foods. We are focused on planning how we will operate as one company and better serve our customers. Our integration planning efforts has three primary goals day one readiness, value creation and long-term organizational design. We're off to a good start and we look forward to working with our U.S. Foods' colleagues on the merger integration planning as we determine how to bring together the best of both these two great companies.", "As we've discussed, we expect a thorough regulatory review to take place over the next six to nine months and we recently learned that the FTC will be the agency leading the regulatory review for the government.", "As part of the merger consideration Sysco will assume or refinance all of U.S. Foods net debt of approximately $4.7 billion. We have begun to take the steps necessary to secure financing to do that as well as hedge the interest rate risk between now and closing. In December, we secured fully committed bridge financing which will be available upon closing to fund the acquisition and refinance U.S. Food's debt. Shortly thereafter, U.S. Foods obtained consent from holders of their 8.5% notes to waive a provision that would have an effect require Sysco to purchase the notes upon a change of control.", "This consent allowed us to reduce the bridge facility to $3.4 billion thereby reducing our financing cost. At the end of January, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the amounts available to us by $500 million to $1.5 billion and last week we entered into agreements to hedge the interest rate risk on $2 billion of the permanent financing.", "In closing, while the challenging business environment in the food service industry continues to impact our customers and our financial results. We remain encouraged by the progress of our efforts to transform the way we do business. We strongly believe that the investments we are making in our business are vital to our future success and position us extraordinarily well for the future. The proposed merger steps up the momentum for change and provide many additional exciting opportunities for Sysco and the industry.", "With that operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll take John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities", "Bill, a couple of things, one thing I may missed I may not have heard. You talked about some of the actions you're taking on the cost side, but you also mentioned actions taken to drive street sales or street cases? What specifically are you doing there?", "Bill DeLaney III", "Yes. John, good morning. Well, as I said we're doing several things. I think what I said was we got a lot going on both on the cost side as you point out as well as addressing what our biggest challenge is right now driving sales on the locally managed business as well as addressing margin and those two as you well know are very unrelated.", "In the short-term, we've revised our comp plan for MAs about a year ago and that's pretty well fully implemented now in the States and in process in Canada. There is an element of that today that we didn't have before it's not overly significant but it's meaningful which is predicated upon growing cases we just finished up another new account promotion. So we see opportunities to kind of get back in a more regular coordination of business -- new business promotions penetration promotions both with our local marketing people as well as from a national perspective.", "We got as you can appreciate a lot of pretty comprehensive margin management training going on in the company at various level both locally as well as coming out of our corporate offices in terms of how do we optimize this whole challenge of quality growth with managing margin. Those are initiatives that kicked off in a bigger way here in the fall. So those will be three that I mentioned the short-term that we think we'll pay dividends for us here to some extent, they're already helping, but I think we'll pay bigger dividends for the second half of the fiscal year.", "Beyond that John I think the others are more along these lines of the strategic initiatives we have been talking to you about which is we're doing a lot more work in marketing in terms of gaining objective custom insights, our CRM tools is further along in terms of implementation. We really do believe CatMan is going to help us a lot once that matures both on the sales side as well as on the margin side, it should be win-win for us and our suppliers and our customers.", "And we got some other things going that are more pilot stages with revenue management inside sales platform that type of thing and beyond that Sysco ventures are still something out there we continue to grow and we believe long-term will give us opportunity to create traction with our customers. So many of these are more medium term, but as I said, we have heightened up the intensity on some of those short-term initiatives.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities", "So this is a follow up to that, you said 25% of the margin pressure was mix. So if you look at the others and this is probably hard to tell precisely but if you look at the other 75%, how much of that do you think is proactive, you're doing something versus reactive when you're responding to somebody else? And then the parts that proactive again how do you get your arms around that these are productive efforts right when you look at gross profit dollar performance?", "Bill DeLaney III", "Yes. Let me take a shot and if I'm not giving to John, just clear about your question a little bit more so. Look so I'd say over the last year, year and a half we've attributed a third to a quarter of the margin erosion to mix because of the larger customers are growing faster. The rest of it, it is difficult to quantify. Obviously, the way our business model works we can't just look at gross margin we have to look at our expenses as well. So we are definitely going to fight very hard for the cases we have today as well as continue to find ways to grow with our existing customers in our new prospects as well.", "So I think where we're at right now in this process is I look at even early numbers this quarter is we're beginning to get smarter I think and a little bit more cohesive at the local level and making the right trade offs between volume and margin management. But the reality in this business for us is we need to grow the local business we need to grow the street business and that will contribute significantly to our gross profit dollar growth. We just got to be smart and balanced in how we do it. And so I think we're making strides there, you didn't really see here in the second quarter I think you will see some improvement here in the second half of the year as far as the margin management goes.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities", "And just lastly then, do you think giving the industry as a whole is behaving rationally in terms of balancing margin and case volume?", "Bill DeLaney III", "That's one of those great questions I don't know if I can answer as well as anyone of us would like. I think as I said the competitive environment is very acute as we've talked about a lot in the past in presentations and calls like this. There is some growth we believe -- we believe the market grew somewhat in 2013 we'll fine tune those numbers and hopefully talk more about it. At CAGNY, we don't think there was a lot of growth and we were able to take some share but we invested in that to some extent. I think that's rational from our perspective because in the end I think for our medium and long-term success it's important to continue to grow. There certainly are pockets of activity out there where there is some behavior that probably isn't the smartest as it could be. But overall, given the environment I think it's reasonably rational right now. It's just very competitive.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.", "Karen Short - Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Just turning to cost per case expectations for the full year, I guess your full year expectations kind of reflect flat cost per case in the second half. So I know you've discussed this in the past, but I guess I am wondering with a successful kind of wave 1 behind you, wave 2 about to begin and three more OPCO conversions by year-end. Why wouldn't you continue to see improvements in cost per case for the back half?", "Chris Kreidler", "Hi, Karen. I think we will continue to see improvements in cost per case in the back half. What we're really commenting to is the fact that we're going to be lapping some significant work that was begun last year. So the quarter-over-quarter performance is not going to feel as good as the first half year of the year. We do think we'll be down at least a nickel, I think I admitted this time it will probably exceed a nickel a case as we look at the full year and we're just not necessarily giving a higher exact number to that right now.", "Bill DeLaney III", "I think Karen, let me just add. When we talk about cost per case, we're talking about operating cost. So we definitely are seeing reduction in cost per case for the CatMan work and we expect that to continue.", "Karen Short - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And any color on wave 1 in terms of how your customers are reacting to the initiative? And any color you could give on what they benefit to gross profit or COGS could have been as a result?", "Bill DeLaney III", "I think it's still reasonably early in the wave 1 cycle, but I would tell you I think our execution, I think, we alluded to this in our comments. I think we are improving our execution there in terms of how we do the conversions, the cadence of the conversions and addressing these opportunities in the most productive way possible with our customers. So I think we've had some challenges with the pilot categories on volume at times. We're starting to see some improvement on wave 1. We continue to see, like I said, significant improvement on our cost of goods which was driving most of the economics on this initiative.", "Karen Short - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just last question. Obviously inflation came down this quarter which was pretty widely expected but any comments on your outlook for the third quarter and beyond, I mean there is a lot of noise with the drought in California and protein inflation and things like that?", "Bill DeLaney III", "Yes, I was actually a little surprised with how much it came down. And we hit about one point of inflation which was kind of low. So I'd say sitting here today depending I'm not going to project impact of weather and that kind of thing that's difficult to do. But I would expect it to remain pretty modest somewhere in that 1% to 2% range but we'll have to see.", "Chris Kreidler", "Most of the external stuff that we read Karen is probably the same as you read expected to kind of go back to a more normal range whether its bills one to two or I guess what the others say out there two to three but we would expect it to be a little higher than where it is today. It's a hard thing to predict as last year or may be 18 months ago remember we had a drought everybody was expecting food cost inflation to go through the roof again and we never saw that materialize.", "Karen Short - Deutsche Bank", "Right. Okay. Thanks that's helpful.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies", "Hi, good morning. On your comment that the sales slowed throughout the end of the quarter, how much of that was really the calendar and the weather? And did you see any snap back as you got into January results?", "Bill DeLaney III", "I think the calendar was certainly part of it Mark, and we did have some weather, it was last couple of weeks in December. I think that impacted us in certain parts of the country. So I would say it's hard to put a number to it but I would say part of the slowdown was that \u2013 we had pretty good growth in the second quarter last year. So when you look at comps \u2013 and we are talking about deltas of 2% or 3% case growth here. So if it goes off a point that's 50% of the delta. So I'd say it's a little bit of \u2013 comps are little more soft but we definitely saw a fall-off in December and certainly from what we see and what we read. I think you'd have to attribute a fair amount of that to the weather.", "We knew the calendar but we still saw a little more than what we expected to see. I hate talking about weather especially in winter. We just had our market presence in here couple of weeks ago and really didn't want to hear a lot about weather. But I will tell you weather has been pretty brutal here first four, five weeks that we've had. Four of the five weeks I think have been very difficult last week in particular. You see the weather reports, we had issues throughout the southeast. We didn't ship in New Orleans. You saw the reports in Atlanta. The good news is its January and early February so March is a key part of this quarter and we still have an opportunity to make some of that back. But I'd say weather has impacted us quite a bit so far in January, early February.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies", "Okay. And on the gross margin weakness did you have any pressure on the meats categories, red meat was a pressure for at least one of your smaller competitors out there?", "Bill DeLaney III", "I can't tell you as any more pronounced in that areas and any place because obviously those are high dollar boxes so you kind of get somewhat competitive depending on the size of the customer. But I wouldn't attribute any particular piece of it to meat category.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies", "Okay. And for Chris, is there anyway you can give us a rough idea of what kind of interest rate we should be looking at for the big refinancing for the U.S. Foods deal?", "Chris Kreidler", "No. I wish I knew myself our strategy as I talked a little bit about it to hedge interest rates, but I mean this environment we've chosen to basically hedge about half, which means if they continue to languish or indeed decline, we won't give away all the benefit, if they go up, we're partially hedged. So that's kind of where we're hanging out right now. We'll continue to evaluate the markets as well as the yield curve going forward and look for an opportune time to lock in and obviously we've got to get much further along in the deal process and the regulatory approval process as well, but right now, I can't give you much more guidance.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Good morning. You sounded kind of optimistic about this year market conditions restaurants are getting may be back to positive traffic. I just wanted to ask you to explain a little about what you're thinking there sort of generally why you might think that? And then secondly, as part of the same question, have you seen you just talked about Atlanta and what's going on there but between the fourth quarter and the recent snow events and cold weather in the east, have you seen a bigger variance in the performance between places that had normal weather out west let's say versus the east you could share with us that might give us a sense if that is the case?", "Bill DeLaney III", "Andy, I will. So, let me start with the second one. I tried to give you a little color on that in my prepared comments. And so right now yes, I'm looking very hard at the West because we haven't seen that kind of weather out there. So we're seeing, I think, I called out the Southwest and to be fair I'd say the Southwest, if you go back the last two or three years has been probably the strongest part of the market.", "If you look at some of the more industry-wide survey work that's done on consumers, the Southwest shows up quite strong. And I would say right now we're trending -- it's hard to do this Andy because I have to adjust for that variability you were alluding to, in terms of our individual performances.", "But I'd say, if I just look at the West right now, things are a little bit better there, which gives me the confidence that some of this actually, clearly is being driven by weather in terms of early days here in this quarter. So with that said, the other thing I called out was, we've seen now for several quarters that the Northeast and what we call our Mid-East markets have seen more pronounced sluggishness and it's not to say we don't have opportunities to execute better in those markets but at the same time when I look at them across that entire geography that seems to be a tougher part of the country in terms of growth right now.", "As far as why I'm optimistic, I would say it's interesting when you read all these reports that some of you published and that we all read, the state of mind consumers is reasonably good right now. The state of mind of our customers is reasonably good, when you look at forward-looking feelings about the future. So any time people are optimistic, that gives you reason to be optimistic, and that's part of it.", "I think there's some technical issues that are somewhat clouded by the weather right now with some of the tax hits that the consumer took early last year that I'm hopeful that those will turn into positives here as we get towards spring and into summer. So I think the mindset is better and it's fragile. I'm not going to kid you on that. And when you look at the economic data, it's good at a certain level of macro and not so good in our piece of the industry, but I'm basically going off of, some of the sentiment surveys that we see in terms of the consumer, some technical things that we see in terms of what happened last year, early part of the calendar year.", "And I would say, even though we're somewhat challenged here in terms of our performance for the quarter, haven't had a chance to talk to a lot of our people, I think we really believe that we are gaining traction on our initiatives and that we will see improvement here as we get deeper into the calendar year. Was that good?", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "It's interesting, do have any, and last question but it's a follow on to what you just answered. Do you have a sense of the same store sales for your independence and is that something also you have by geography? And could also shed light on in the context of regional variance?", "Bill DeLaney III", "I don't have a great sense of that. We will obviously have our sales data where we can look at that at various levels of details in terms of what we call penetration that doesn't tell you what the accounts same-store sales are right?", "I would tell you it varies. So whether you're talking big change, or whether you're talking about more street oriented type of operators, the stronger operators I think are holding up reasonably well in this kind of market and the people that are more on the margin are struggling more.", "So we see a fair amount of variability across customers as it relates to penetration. My best judgment and I don't have any data on this Andy is that it's reasonably flat right out in terms of restaurant sales overall, same-store sales. I think if you \u2013 some change, we're doing better than others obviously.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Hi, good morning. I had a variation of some of the previous questions, but it's more specific to the outlook for the current quarter. I think at least some of the casual dining names, it looks like traffic was down significantly in December. I think it even turned negative in a few cases. So my guess is that that trend probably continued into January because of some of the cabin fever or weather-related issues that you talked about.", "And then it looks like you're also getting the benefit of some inflation and you talked about inflation a little earlier. But I think some of the government data suggests some deflation over the last three of four months. So from your prepared comments, it sounds like you are more optimistic about sales trends for calendar 2014. But do you foresee potential for incremental volume weakness in the current quarter from the combination of even potentially deflationary pressure or and also sort of the continuation of some of the weather-related impact? Thanks.", "Bill DeLaney III", "Yes. Good morning, Ajay. I would \u2013 I think I'm on at that thing, well, I tried to get across to my comments. I'm pretty cautious on this quarter right now on the top line just given what we have been dealing with the first four or five weeks. As I said, the March drives this particular quarter. So if we catch up a break with the weather and maybe we've seen the worst of it. In terms of parts of the country where you don't expect to see this kind of weather that's really the issue.", "So when weather affects us is when you have these freezers and snowstorms in the Southeast and the Southwest that's a problem, okay. When they carry into April that's a problem, when they started early November that's a problem. Winters going to be winter in the Northeast and the Mid-West and we understand that. So I'm somewhat cautious because of the weather and how we started out this quarter. But, there is still a lot of good weeks ahead of us in terms of volume as we get toward later part of February and March.", "I'm more optimistic on the year just for reasons I discussed earlier there I think the consumer is in a better place and I think with the break here and there that's going to be good for our customers and we are very well-positioned to leverage that terms of our business.", "Deflation, we're not always seeing deflation. We are seeing categories that are maybe down a little bit, up a little bit. We have got some inflation in meat and seafood I think going right now. So deflation would not be good for us. Again, what we \u2013 was more ideal for us would be to have that inflation number get back around 2 maybe even a little bit higher that gives us a little more room to maneuver in terms of our expense management and at the same time work with our customers and the way that they can handle the cost increases.", "So deflation would not be good but I don't necessarily think we are looking at deflation. I think we are looking at as we said earlier moderate inflation continuing.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Great. Thank you.", "Bill DeLaney III", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays. And your line is open. Please check your mute button. Again, check your mute button, your line is open. Due to the silence on this line we will take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Hi. Thank you. The question is how your customers might be responding to the merger, or I guess the news of the merger. I mean is it situation, I guess FTC excluded one plus one could equal two or do you sound some nervousness of your \u2013 within your customer base or consolidation of power and that's the case what will you do maybe differently in six to nine months to retain some business that some of your competition might otherwise be trying to get?", "Bill DeLaney III", "Good morning, John. Look, I would say this, from the day one of the announcements through today and going forward to close and then beyond close, certainly one of our big goals here is to have a very active, effective communication program with all of our stakeholders. So it's our customers, our suppliers, our associates, shareholders, government media all that type of things.", "So we are early days of dealing with that. We are in constant contact with our customers. We have equipped our OPCO presidents and there sales leadership with pieces to communicate with the local chefs associations, restaurant associations. So I would characterize that early days as we got good ongoing discussions with our customers, certainly there is some that have some concerns we work through those. I would say many are excited to understand what the benefits are. And how long it will take to close and when will all that happen.", "And I would say largely customers are pretty open minded and they are looking for those benefits. So whether it's going to enhance their business from \u2013 how they might order product with us or wider assortment of innovative products. The fact that we will take cost out of the system over time how that translates to their opportunity to work with Sysco. Those are all things that we are taking with our customers about. We clearly see this as a very good thing for our customers, frankly I see this as a very good thing for the industry over time and certainly we will see as a good thing for Sysco.", "So I think generally it's very open-minded and constructive. Obviously, there are some people out there that don't like this, they tend to be more on the competitive side of the ball and they are having those types of conversations and we are addressing that as appropriate.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Thank you.", "Bill DeLaney III", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays", "Thanks for taking my question. First, I just would like to talk a little bit about how much of that category management are done with -- finished wave 1. I think you made some comments about what the impact was, you think it's recovering. Could you just be more specific about what happens with revenues or customer reaction, with the category management?", "Bill DeLaney III", "Yes. I will take a shot at that Meredith. So essentially the whole idea of category management is to optimize the assortment of pricing theory in an effort to help our customers optimize and enhance the products that are available to them as well. Along the lines, we certainly see opportunities here to enhance our relationships with our suppliers and prove product development innovation and reduce our SKUs where that make sense. And to take cost out of the system as relates to our cost of good. The challenge as you would expect as you go into something like this is the conversion process.", "So I would say to you in the pilot wave or pilot categories there was four of them. We did a very good job working with our suppliers; we did a very good job identifying opportunities for cost savings and we are realizing those. What we are learning as we go is to strike the right balance in terms of the cadence and the conversions with our customers and to make sure we are equipping all operating companies' sales management and the MAs with the tools that they need to have the conversations about conversions with the customers in the right place.", "So where we are making process at this point I think it's on the conversion and we expect to continue make process as we get deeper in wave 1 and wave 2.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays", "So when you say you are running more about how to do the conversions, does that mean that there was unhappiness initially?", "Bill DeLaney III", "Meredith, anytime you sit down with a human being and tell them they are \u2013 and you got an idea and you are going to ask them to change what they are doing, there is some challenges to that. So I would say yes, as we got into it, even though we have done I think a tremendous job in terms of developing the communication pieces training our people there is always the dynamic that you deal with across the table from a customer. So we ran into some challenges there. We still have them.", "But, I would say this in a more straightforward way as I can. It's really more about just making sure, since the conversion is relevant to that customer many of them are. We are not converting every item for every customer. But to make sure that we are having good constructive dialog in terms of why it's different for the consumer. And as you play that out over 7,000 territories with 10s of 1000s of customers and something you have done for the first time certainly there are challenges. But, I would tell you again, I'm seeing improvement on that and performance there as we get into wave 1 and expected to continue to improve.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays", "Okay. Thank you. And then another just sort of food question that confirms something Chris said about the cost per case, I think you set down 5%, I wasn't sure if he was saying down 5% for second half or down 5% for the full year?", "Chris Kreidler", "Meredith, I actually said down $0.05 per case will be down at least \u2013", "Meredith Adler - Barclays", "$0.05?", "Chris Kreidler", "$0.05 per case for the full year.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays", "Okay. And this, do you include the pension change as part of the cost per case?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yes. That's an all end case per case.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question with Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Yes. Good morning guys.", "Bill DeLaney III", "Good morning.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "I just have a \u2013 I guess a lot of my questions are sort of around modeling and how I think about the back of the year. But, the first one is on mix and I guess the impact of negative mix on sales which seems this quarter to be higher, I only say that because we sort of like try to figure out what your volume growth is based on the data points you give, right. We would come up with a lower number by about 70 basis points. We are not typically that high. So is the negative impact and mix accelerating and then would you expect it to stay at this level or could it even be higher?", "Bill DeLaney III", "I'm going to start and then let Chris do that. I can't speak to the modeling part of that. I would say it's not accelerating. What I would say is, as we said in our prepared comments, we are still seeing good growth with a larger customers regional and national customers. We are just not seeing enough growth here on the local side. But I wouldn't say that it accelerated at all.", "Chris Kreidler", "I'm not sure. I can add a lot. Your question was negative mix on sales, correct?", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Correct. You know, Chris, it's just that if I think about your dollar sales and I adjust for acquisitions and I adjust for inflation, right, I'm going to come out with a 2% volume growth number, right? You get 2.7.", "Chris Kreidler", "Right.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "70 basis points it's bigger than what its been historically and I'm trying to figure out if that is the number I should be using going forward?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yes. We had that conversation before. I understand that how folks come up with what I get, they call real growth and that's just not a number that we would ever \u2013 put much credence in, which is why we start giving you actual case volumes. So that number is going to move around for a variety of different reasons. And we frankly just don't track it.", "Bill DeLaney III", "I would say the bigger issue on this quarter rather than some of the sluggishness in December that we have already talked about. If you compare the first quarter to the second quarter your inflation number went from 2 to 1. And that's probably the bigger \u2013", "Chris Kreidler", "Inflation and actually your ForEx was a little higher as well. When you put both of those in there and your sales number is not a significantly off of where we were.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Then the other question relates to a sequential change in the business is, this notion of looking at your volume growth right relative to your gross profit dollar growth. And that spread seems to have widened a bit. So which I guess could be \u2013 could be competition market or whatever. But, I guess, how do you think about that. I know you typically don't want it. You would like to grow gross profit sort of closer to volume, right? So going forward should I be using this type of spread, do you think it can improve?", "Bill DeLaney III", "As I said, we came up with somewhat short of our internal goals here for the quarter and that was on the gross profit dollar line. But, I would the spread was about the same as it was in the first half. We had a top line miss and we will continue to have gross profit pressure and margin pressure on all categories to customers actually so I \u2013 what I'm looking at the spread is about the same as in the first quarter.", "Chris Kreidler", "Obviously, you got to do your own modeling. Our plan certainly don't call for or allow for a 0.7% gross margin growth number. We are clearly higher than that. We clearly have higher expectations for that. And Bill explained that's where we got a tremendous amount of focus and we talked about it for a number of quarters here. So that's not in our short or long-term projections.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "All right. And Chris, you are going to lapse in acceleration and the acquisition benefit in the back half year?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yes.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "So I guess you would expect that benefit to slowdown, I guess is that, right?", "Chris Kreidler", "It will. We kind of expressed what we think the full year benefit will be. We -- just the carry over deals themselves would boost us by at least 1% in terms of sales and then new transactions every year are targeted at least 1% say you get about half point impact for the year. So add those up and generally our expectation is about 0.5.", "So we still have a significant pipeline of transactions. We got this major one that we have to work our way through of course. And so U.S. acquisitions may slow a bit but we still have focus in Canada and focus in other geographies.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Nice. And then just one last question for you on SAP. Now that it looks like you got through Boise, what's the next big OPCO going to get done, is that \u2013 within the next group and are you comfortable now that some of the changes you made get you over the hurdle to get a big OPCOs on just as well now?", "Bill DeLaney III", "We just as I mentioned we just did Phoenix and Vegas last weekend. Actually so we were work week two there now add so we are early days but we are feeling good about that. I think I also mentioned if things stay on course both with the next round of enhancements as well as what we see in these last three companies, we expect to do a couple of more in latter part of this fiscal year, they would both be very large companies.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Bill DeLaney III", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Greg Hassler with Bank of America.", "Greg Hassler - Bank of America", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And apologize if I missed this earlier. I think you may have addressed and it was cutting out a little bit. But in terms of the refinancing that you guys intend to do, should we just expect that to be closer to the time of the closing of the transaction? I think you've said, you expected to take or at least the FTC review to take 9 to 12 months, so just trying to think of this from a timing perspective.", "Chris Kreidler", "It will certainly be closer to the time of the transaction whether we take advantage of market conditions and confidence levels prior to that. It will depend upon a number of factors and terms of when we'll actually pull the trigger to do some of this refinancing.", "Greg Hassler - Bank of America", "Okay. And then, in terms of the overall size, you've got a pretty big chunk of legacy U.S. Foods that's here to refinance, but then at Sysco, you also have some shorter term borrowings. You've got a 2014 and a 2015 maturity coming up. So we expected, you kind of do that all at once, or could you be coming to market multiple times here over the next couple of years?", "Chris Kreidler", "Obviously, our goal was not to be -- to come to market a whole bunch of different times. It will -- it tends to cause a little inefficiency in terms of pricing as well as disruption. At the same time, we've got something that comes due and we see an opportunity to refinance a chunk of it, both our side as well as pre-refinancing the U.S. Foods merger consideration we may look for an opportunity to do that.", "Greg Hassler - Bank of America", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's Sysco second quarter fiscal 2014 conference call.

Please go ahead ma\u2019am.", "Shannon Mutschler", "Thanks Anna. Good morning everyone and welcome to Sysco's third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. Today you will hear prepared remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions subsequent to SEC filings and then the news release issued earlier this morning.

We have determined that it would be most effective to hold the meeting after the proposed merger with US Foods closes. Accordingly, we\u2019ll update you once the firm date for the event has been chosen.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney", "Thanks Shannon. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported third quarter sales of $11.3 billion in net earnings of $181 million. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding certain items was $0.38 for the quarter, compared to $0.40 in the prior year. Market conditions during the first two months of the quarter were dominated by the impact of unusually severe winter weather conditions throughout much of the United States. As a result, we experienced very modest sales growth in January and February and delivery expenses were under significant pressure as well.", "Conditions improved markedly in March as the adverse weather subsided, which likely contributed to consumers going out more both to shop and eat. We benefited from this turn of events as evidenced by our nearly 6% sales growth in March, almost twice the top-line growth we experienced for the overall quarter. In assessing our operating performance for the quarter and factoring in the challenging market conditions, results were generally inline with our expectations.", "Sales growth were modest at 3.2% was aided by improved, locally managed sales trends in March. Gross profit grew nearly at the rate of sales growth and at a higher rate than we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year. We also reduced our operating cost for case in our Broadline business. We are encouraged by improved gross profit trends during the quarter and attributed much of our progress in this area to more consistent margin management practices in our operating companies, strengthening local sales trends and the low level of inflation we experienced during much of the quarter.", "Moving forward, we assume our cost is regarding gross margin trends in the short-term as we begun to see a meaningful increase in product cost inflation in the high cost meat and dairy categories since the end of the quarter. The consistently improved cost per case results, we\u2019re experiencing in the Broadline business have been driven by the benefits realized from several cost reduction initiatives we\u2019ve implemented over the past two years, especially in the SG&A area of the business. As some of these benefits begin to ramp on a year-over-year basis, we expect to realize increased benefits from more of our transformation initiatives on the operation side of the business.", "Turning to our technology transformation initiatives, this fiscal year between November and March we implemented our new ERP platform at three operating companies and in April converted it to additional locations for a total of 10 companies running on the new ERP technology. The successful conversion of five OPCOs in six months reflects our consistent progress in strengthening and stabilizing our ERP platform.", "In addition, we work to ensure smoother transitions for each successful convergence, for example improved procedures in attention to data management help to make the go-live at Denver and New Orleans last month a more successful year. Regarding our initiatives to lower product costs, we expect to meet our stated financial objectives for this fiscal year and next as our category management efforts continued to gain momentum.", "By the end of this fiscal year, the pilot all the wave 1 and majority of wave 2 categories were launched into the market representing $5 billion to $7 billion in annual spend and roughly a third of the total addressable spend. We continue to enhance the program\u2019s effectiveness by showing best practices and improving communication both of the corporate merchandising and operating company level.", "We also continue to progress on our initiatives to lower operating costs. During the quarter, we advanced our routing optimization project, which is resulting in reduced routes in miles driven while improving on-time deliveries. Our fleet optimization initiative is underway and we have removed hundreds of older pieces of equipment from the system with more to come.", "In addition, we have now completed an initiative to negotiate standard terms and specifications for fleet purchases. These changes combined with similar actions for warehouse equipment completed earlier this year will help us reduce costs and optimize our capital spend as we move forward.", "Regarding our proposed merge with US Foods, the integration planning team is making good progress toward bringing our two companies together as Chris will describe in a few minutes. This transaction represents a significant opportunity to enhance our ability to serve our customers, strengthen our supplier partnerships, further engage our employees and enhance profitability through meaningful synergies.", "We are encouraged by our continuous improvement on multiple fronts throughout the company and believe that this transformational change will help our customers to be more successful through our added efficiency in our business and enhance our financial results. Personally engaging in transformation of this magnitude is both challenging and rewarding for me as well as for all of our 49,000 associates. I very much appreciate their efforts and dedication, as we move forward in this exciting and pivotal time in Sysco\u2019s history.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the things over to Chris, so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.", "R. Chris Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $11.3 billion or an increase of 3.2%, compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased Case volume, including the impact of acquisitions. Case volume increased 3% for the quarter and Case volume excluding acquisitions increased 2.3%. Inflation remained quite modest during the quarter, increasing sales by 0.9% and changes in foreign exchange rate decreased sales by 0.9%.", "As Bill mentioned, January and February sales were negatively impacted by the unusually severe weather throughout most of the country. However, March saw a March rebound with sales growth during the month of 5.5%, which was more in line with the rate of growth in the first half of the year.", "Gross profit in the third quarter increased 2.7% nearly at the same rate of sales growth.", "Gross margin declined 9 basis points to 17.69%, which is the smallest decline we\u2019ve seen in 15 quarters. After taking into account changes in customer mix, gross margin actually increased slightly compared to the prior year. Similar to what we saw with sales trends during the quarter, gross profit was substantially stronger in March, compared to January and February, increasing 4.8% during the month as weather and the locally managed sales trends improved.", "However, as Bill mentioned, since the end of the quarter, we\u2019ve begun to see a meaningful increase in product costs inflation in the meat and dairy categories, which together totaled roughly 30% of our annual sales. We expect this pressure may contribute to added gross margin pressure in the near-term.", "Operating expenses increased $57 million or 3.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, compared to the prior year period. A year-over-year increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased Case volume and new cost from acquired companies, increased delivery and warehouse costs somewhat exacerbated by the unusually severe weather, increased corporate expenses, due mainly to timing, partially offset by lower sales organization costs and a decrease in retirement related expense, as a result of the restructuring work we completed last year.", "Benefits generated from our transformation initiatives more than offset cost pressure in our delivery and warehouse areas, resulting in a $0.03 decline in operating costs per Case in our Broadline operations in the third quarter and a $0.07 decline for the first 39 weeks of the year with both periods excluding the impact of certain items. We remain confident in meeting or exceeding our objective of a $0.05 decline for the full fiscal year as we experienced continued year-over-year benefits from changes in our sales organization and the impact of lower retirement-related expenses.", "The impact from the restructuring of our retirement plan is actually exceeding our expectations. We now expect that retirement-related expenses for fiscal 2014 will be lower by $65 million to $75 million excluding certain items. This is lower than our previous guidance of down $50 million to $60 million and expenses from our enhanced 401(k) benefits have been lower than anticipated.", "As some of the benefits from our SG&A initiatives begin to wrap on a year-over-year basis, we expect to realize increased benefits from more of our transformation initiatives on the operation side of the business.", "Operating expenses including certain items increased $51million or 3.3%, certain items totaled $56 million during the quarter, an increase of $6 million over the same quarter last year. Certain items this quarter consisted primarily of two times; first, merger and integration planning expenses totaled $32 million and mainly related to professional fees.", "Second, we\u2019ve recorded a $20 million legal contingency accrual related to a previously disclosed investigation in California, a portion of which should not deductible for tax purposes. Certain items in the prior year period totaled $50 million including a $41 million charge withdraw from a multiemployer pension fund.", "Business transformation expenses were lower in the third quarter compared to last year by $13 million and were lower by $45 million for the first 39 weeks of the year. About half of the variance year-to-date relates to a change we have made in how we allocate internal labor cost to the project. In the past, we allocated the cost of internal associates based upon the percentage of time they spend on the project.", "We are now allocating either all or none of an associates cost to the project depending on whether they spend the majority of their time on the project. This has had the effect of shifting some expense from business transformation expense to general corporate expense. The remainder of the year-to-date variance in business transformation expense is the result of capitalizing more of the work effort than originally estimated.", "As a result of the change in labor capitalization methodology and the increased amount of capitalization, we now expect total business transformation expenses for the year to be lower than our previous guidance in the range of $275 million to $300 million. And general corporate expenses to be somewhat higher.", "Operating income for the quarter was down 1.4% year-over-year after adjusting for certain items operating income increased 0.3%. Net earnings for the third quarter were $181 million, a decrease of $20 million or 10.2% compared to the prior year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.31 and 8.8% decrease compared to the prior year.", "Adjusting for certain items diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.38, which was down 5%, compared to the prior year. We estimate that the impact of the unusually severe weather in January and February reduced earnings per share by $0.01 to $1.05. Total capital expenditure is totaled to $117 million for the third quarter this year compared to $111 million last year. We continue to expect total capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million for fiscal 2014.", "However, after including anticipated proceeds from asset sales net capital spending will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Free cash flow was $273 million for the third quarter increasing over the prior year period mainly due to improvements in working capital performance which offset weaker net earnings.", "For the first 39 weeks of the year, free cash flow increased 22% to $484 million. As we began to wrap our particularly strong cash flow performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect the level of year-over-year increases in free cash flow to moderate.", "Turning to the pending US Foods merger, we continue to make progress in our integration planning efforts and have engaged in an extensive process focused on three goals; day one readiness, value creation and long-term organizational design. The teams are working well together and has made a lot of progress in a relatively short period of time.", "Regarding the regulatory process our dialog with the SEC continues to be productive as we work to fulfill their second request for information about our business and industry. We continue to believe that this merger will benefit customers and help us become more efficient in an evolving and competitive marketplace. And also believe the SEC will agree that our customers have many choices in the fiercely competitive marketplace in which we operate today. As a result we continue to expect the merger to close in the third calendar quarter of this year.", "In closing, while severe weather in the third quarter present the challenges to the business and our financial results. We\u2019re relatively pleased with our business performance as we exited the quarter. In addition we\u2019re excited about our progress to transform our business and our integration planning efforts related to the US Foods merger.", "While we continue to have much work ahead of us we strongly believe that we are taking the right steps and making the right strategic investments to position our company for success in the future.", "With that operator we\u2019ll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll move first to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.", "John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hey, Bill. I\u2019m pretty encouraged by right your gross margin management. So, the question is, is there a different philosophy with regard to how you were spending those dollars? How you think about elasticity, and if so what is driving that change in philosophy and how you, practically what things you are doing differently.", "William J. DeLaney", "Good morning, John. I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t think there is a different philosophy, I think where you saw some improved execution. We\u2019ve been doing this a long time and we\u2019re always trying to strike the right balance between growth and taking profitable share for the medium to long-term with obviously managing our margins appropriately so.", "From that standpoint what I was trying to convey in my remarks was, clearly we haven\u2019t been performing at the level we\u2019d like and we spend a lot of time \u2013 we\u2019ve done a lot of work with our operators so to speak. And I think what you saw here is a small but meaningful step forward in terms of progress and, I use the word consistency, that\u2019s probably our biggest opportunity in Sysco today and I think the benefits you\u2019re seeing in this quarter were more consistent focus and striking the right balance, I guess that between growth, pricing and what\u2019s good for the customer, anyhow just the basic day today stuff, there is nothing really overly proprietary here.", "When you have commodity prices, continuous attention to how fast they are moving and what direction they are moving in and being responsive in the right ways. So I\u2019d say, it\u2019s more improved execution of that philosophy and hopefully it\u2019s a sign of things to come.", "John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Now is that in terms of giving lots on the improved execution. Is that more getting folks in the field to understand what you\u2019re trying to do and elasticity issues or is it more actually putting sort of guard rails on what they can do out in the field?", "William J. DeLaney", "I would say, our folks in the field understand, I think what it is, is that bringing more focus to the issue with all that they have to deal with on a day-to-day basis and in that process, yes, brining least parameters and overtime a little more governance to that process. So again early days here John, but we certainly are trying to get more consistency in terms of how we approach it. But our folks understand the issue, they are very good operators. It\u2019s more about bringing consistent focus to it.", "John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And then lastly, with inflation picking up, how do you think about this pick up in perishables inflation versus those we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years. We\u2019ve had a couple of these cycles when you look at where the macro is, where you are with US Foods. Are you more or less inclined to pass that through quickly than you might have been in the past?", "William J. DeLaney", "I don\u2019t think the US Foods merger has anything to do with it. I would say what\u2019s interesting, what we are seeing right now John, and this is really just kind of manifest itself in the last four to six weeks. There is double-digit inflation in meat, seafood and dairy. And the rest of the categories are roughly flat, you\u2019re actually down a little bit in grocery, down a little bit in poultry, in terms of what we saw in April.", "So what you\u2019re seeing here is that as you know in particular meat, those are high priced boxes. So it\u2019s challenging at times to pass that along as fast as you might like to with customers, sometimes that\u2019s not even a right thing to do, sometimes it\u2019s ups and down with the customer, kind of reworking their menu in terms of, if poultry is flat to down, working more poultry into the menu.", "So we are just trying to be a little cautious here, I mean the good news here is well, as you know we don\u2019t want to see a lot of inflation over the meaningful long-term. It\u2019s not good for our customers. I mean that inflation is working its way into the top line as well.", "So we\u2019re basically just common Al, I think gross margin as a percent of sales stand perspective. There is more pressure there right now than what we saw in the third quarter. But I think we\u2019ll manage it reasonably well and as far as going forward, a lot of this has to do with supplies in the beef area and I think some of this will be with us for awhile. It\u2019s really hard to predict what happens past three to six months, Al.", "John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "William J. DeLaney", "Sure.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now move to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Good morning. On the March sales improvement, was some of that the inflation you\u2019re talking about or did the cases in the real business also get better?", "William J. DeLaney", "In March Andy is more \u2013 there was not very much inflation. I think we probably saw some in the later couple of weeks of March. But I think March was really more of demand, people got out more and you saw the retail numbers I think, they came out here recently and so it\u2019s just more \u2013 we saw more volume and as we alluded to, we also saw more on the locally managed side than what we see in the last two to three quarters which was encouraging as well.", "Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Did you see that across the board, so the independence, I know in the past you said it\u2019s really hard to track their same-stores sales but just anecdotally or how would you can with the independent business also stronger?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, so independence will make up a significant piece of this locally managed, and yes I would tell you we saw across the board in March. There was very, was really tail two quarters. It was brutally hard out there, I think for everybody the first couple of months and then in March. We saw a turnaround in the top line in pretty much every segment. We saw every restaurant like that.", "R. Chris Kreidler", "Yes, and Andy, I want to be careful and echo what Bill said a minute ago about this inflation, the reason we are calling it out as frankly it come up upon us pretty quickly. We don\u2019t want it to be a surprise when we talk about it later on. But in the March quarter inflation was no different really than the rest of the quarter. And so, it really wasn\u2019t yet in the March numbers as Bill said, that we started to feel at a little bit in the later two weeks. But it was pretty much inline with the quarter.", "It came on, it went from basically nothing to something in April and so that\u2019s why we are calling it out and it\u2019s pretty narrow in terms of the categories but they are big dollar categories for us.", "William J. DeLaney", "I don\u2019t want to get too much in the April because that's something we typically do. I would just say to you, we\u2019ve had two solid months in a row in the top line. They look a little different, April is a month, April is a transition month and so I would say to you a couple of thinks, my sense is spring came little earlier this year than last year. I saw some of the clubs and that type of thing open up and that helped us.", "Easter was little later and people were still I think looking to get out, so April the weeks were not necessarily consistent but it\u2019s a month, we had another solid month on the top line and in the business. And I would just say the mix was little different between pricing and volume as well.", "Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "To follow-up same vein on sales trends and this improvement. When you look at the geographies that probably add less weather impact like California and Florida, let\u2019s say, we have a lot of operations. Was there a better, do you see the same thing or was it stronger the entire quarter, could you just comment on the non-weather affected sales trends?", "William J. DeLaney", "I would say the weather, to go back to that was more East of the Mississippi, so that is virtually all of our markets other than California and West Coast. If I was particularly pronounced even though I would say, winner comes every year, it was particularly pronounced in the Northeast and the Mid-East, but we were shutdown at Atlanta for a couple of days. We didn\u2019t deliver that kind of thing. So I would say those first couple of months, the weather impacted the vast majority of our businesses.", "As you work into March and April here now, I would say it\u2019s pretty much what we saw before, I think we are seeing very good strength in the Southwest, decent strength in the West, North-East and Mid-East still little sluggish. So these are matters of degree, but similar to what I call that I think in the last quarterly earnings release, we are seeing a little more strength certainly in the Southwestern part of the country than we are in the North and Northeastern part of the country.", "Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "William J. DeLaney", "Sure.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll now move to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC", "Yes, hi good morning guys.", "William J. DeLaney", "Good morning.", "Edward J. Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC", "I wanted to just follow-up on gross margin, gross profit, we tried to look at gross profit dollars per case and obviously, this quarter you did better there in terms of year-over-year growth versus where you\u2019ve been.", "Now I know inflation going forward picks up. But do you think the business has reached the point where you\u2019ve done a better job in managing where our gross profit for case should at least be stable to better going forward. Or when you talk about the pressure inflation, are you trying to say that you could still be down a little bit there going forward?", "William J. DeLaney", "Ed, we look at this thing across a lot of different ways. So, I\u2019ll let Chris jumping in here in a minute as well. So, I want to be careful about the gross profit because that\u2019s going to play out in different categories. When I would tell you is the way I look at it, as I look at case growth, I look at the mix of case growth between locally managed, which is largely your street business versus your contract business.", "And then, I look at gross profit dollar growth, and then I look at cost per case \u2013 operating cost per case. So, we can put that together, I don\u2019t want to shift in terms of your question on this call, but I would tell you obviously the first half of the year we had 1.2% gross profit dollar growth and that went to 2.7%. So, I\u2019m encouraged with that. I think we can continue to improve from there. We\u2019ll have to see how fast that develops.", "So I feel good about that part. I think, we\u2019ll continue to manage the cost per case well. I think, just and put this in some historical contacts, Chris and I were talking before the call. I\u2019ve been around this business 25 years give or take, I would tell you, if you go back and look at Sysco\u2019s history we didn\u2019t always share all this, to mange our operating cost per case to be up a $0.05 a year was usually a pretty good year in normal times.", "Our medium to longer-term model where we\u2019re trying to find enough initiatives every year to keep that at flat cost per case, in this particular year 2014, we targeted a $0.05 reduction as Chris pointed out. So, I\u2019m really pleased with how we are managing at the operating level, in terms of cost and encourage too much is not a trend make here, but I\u2019m encouraged what we are seeing on the gross profit dollar growth. I don\u2019t know, Chris is going to answer your specific question about what you put historic as well.", "R. Chris Kreidler", "Yes. I probably won\u2019t get into any specifics, but I want to echo what Bill said, it is one of the metrics we look at, but we look at a lot. And the challenge on that particular one depends upon a lot of different variables one of which, we\u2019ve been talking about here, which is inflation and inflation by certain categories.", "So, if we get a lot of inflation and it happens to be in high dollar categories at sometimes are fee per pound or fee per case that can play havoc with that particular number. So, it is part of what we look at, but as Bill says, we\u2019re driving the business for gross profit dollar growth. And that\u2019s why we were generally pleased with the way we exited the quarter with the amount of growth that we saw in March.", "Edward J. Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC", "Yes. That makes sense. Okay. And then, just last question for you. Category manager, maybe could you provide just a bit more detail on sort of what you\u2019re seeing out there? What you\u2019re hearing from customers, where you\u2019re at? And I guess even more specifically like how our sales doing in a category then how our gross profit dollars doing in the categories?", "William J. DeLaney", "Sure. We\u2019re a year into this now, and as I mentioned, we\u2019re deep into wave 1 and wave 2. And we think, by the end of the year we will launched about 30% of what we called the influenceable spend, which is about two-thirds of our spend 60% to 70%. We\u2019re getting better executing that, so I would tell you there are certainly opportunity to improve, but we\u2019re assuming getting better in terms of working within our corporate merchandizing team and with our OPCOs in terms of how we communicate these category, and issues as they come out there is a lot of categories out there being launched right now.", "We\u2019re getting better in terms of working with our OPCOs to work with our customers and their sales force and had the position of the opportunities for the customer as well again plenty of opportunity to improve over the next 12 to 18 months as well.", "So, I think our execution is getting better, both on the communication side as well on the conversion side. We continue to see very good reductions in the cost of goods, certainly as much it ties better than what we originally plan. The sales line where we had some challenges earlier on there in terms of some of the conversions, I think we are getting better as a company in terms of positioning those conversions with customers and in the subsequent ways the sales trends are somewhat better than what we saw in the prior.", "So, I would say \u2013 I would characterize it that is gradual continuous improvement on the execution \u2013 still relatively early days here and it would be a big part of our progress for next fiscal year as well.", "Edward J. Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC", "Great, thank you.", "William J. DeLaney", "Welcome.", "Operator", "We will now move to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.", "Karen F. Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. It\u2019s just a couple of a questions on MAs. I guess, wondering, you made a comment in the press release Bill about improved weather and locally managed sales strengthened, I guess. So, I guess the first question is, what do you mean by exactly by locally managed sales strengthened?", "And then the second part of that question is I guess there is definitely rumblings out there, their people might be going after your MAs knowing that there is going to be disruption. So wondering in this kind of environment as you\u2019re leading into the close, how do you \u2013 kind of how do you retain your best sales people and how do you please them that their won\u2019t be a much disruption as some people fear?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, so let me take the first one Karen. So locally managed was something I\u2019ve kind of coined here over the last 18 months. We use it more internally, but I don\u2019t really like to speak externally differently, I do internally. So it\u2019s an attempt which is getting traction now within Sysco. It\u2019s to have more clarity for operating in our market precedence. So the certain segment sales which we will call street sales, local contract being another, basically where the customer and that decision maker that relationship is driven with a local OPCO, we\u2019ve just kind of bundled that a little bit more than just talking about street from an accountability standpoint and from an influencing standpoint.", "So it\u2019s an internal terminology. We still look at street within that number. So we look at both, I would tell you I think you would know this over the last four or six quarters what we\u2019ve seen is our corporate manager largely our national \u2013 large regional business has grown at a faster rate than our locally managed. And in fact, the locally managed growth is pretty modest, and it was modest again in January and February. So when I was referring to there, as it did strengthen in March along with the other book of business as well. And that is very encouraging and that is the key part of our growth and that is the key part of our profitability leveraging as well.", "So it\u2019s a big part of our business and something we put a lot of emphasis on and in the fairness, while these initiatives we\u2019ve been driving out both in terms of the sales organization, cap man that kind of thing. That directly impacts that sales force, our local sales management teams and ultimately the customer, and so there has been a fair amount of distractions out there over the last year. And I think we are starting to see that we are \u2013 we are though a lot of that and beginning to manage it better.", "As far as MA retention or MA numbers, we had situations in some of our companies last year where we as we had some of that distraction and disruption, we allowed our MA workforce to fall well below where our target members where. And we are coming back there, so we are not all the way back, but we had targeted growth numbers for this year and we are beginning to approach those to get to the level we want to get to.", "We did eliminate several unprofitable territories about a year ago and we pretty much have worked our way through that process. As far as marketplace, please take this to \u2013 our people are always under high demand everybody comes after our sales people. We do generally a pretty job of retaining them. And I would say from the merger standpoint, our folks right now are excited, and whether there is some isolated situations there I wouldn\u2019t necessarily attribute them to the merger and there maybe a challenge I think as we pull all this together but right now I wouldn\u2019t tell you that's, it\u2019s not a big issue from the Sysco side, and it could be initiative as we put the company\u2019s together.", "Karen F. Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay that\u2019s very helpful. And then just on Denver, New Orleans you commented that there was most successful conversions yet, maybe can you just talk a little bit more about why and what you did, and then what are your plans you are going to make, if you said that and I missed that out, but fair conversions for the rest of the year.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, well Denver, New Orleans, first of all they are both very large companies, very profitable companies. So that was a big step. I mentioned one example in my prepared remarks where, data management, is kind of issue for us and that\u2019s the basic thing that you look out in all conversions, but one of the things that happens when there is that much change going on sometimes, you don\u2019t have this consistent focus as you need. So we took out learning from the previous conversions and did much better and we\u2019ll continue to do better on that front.", "I would also tell you on the customer side, we were more connected in particular with our larger regional and national customers in terms of how the conversion would impact them. And so as issues did arise, we were much more connective as an organization between the technology group and the sales group and that was a big part as well. So those are the two things I would call.", "As far as going forward, we are having those discussions right. We\u2019re going to need overly, our view of the integration planning work. Currently that\u2019s going on with the merger and look at that, there is an opportunity to do probably a couple more companies we haven\u2019t made a final decision on that but I think there is a good chance that we probably do two more and then take a step back and look at where we are in the merger.", "Karen F. Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Right thanks a lot.", "William J. DeLaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now move to Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, can hear you?", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes, good thanks. My first question is, you talked about MAs at your own company. Can you talk about at all that what\u2019s happening at US foods?", "R. Chris Kreidler", "Meredith, this is Chris. We really can\u2019t. We\u2019re competitors in the market and while we are going thorough a tremendous amount of integration planning, we really are trying to avoid talking about their performance, their sales, their on challenges initiatives out there, so that\u2019s something better directed directly to them.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, I also have a question, did you talk about the Easter shift at all impacting March, and probably would have been negative, and March was very strong, do you think it would have been stronger, it hadn\u2019t been for the Easter shift?", "William J. DeLaney", "What is the first part of your question, really what would have been negative?", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "In the Easter shift\u2026", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes", "Meredith", "By March to April?", "William J. DeLaney", "So your question is, if Easter been earlier, would it been better.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes.", "William J. DeLaney", "No there, I think a late Easter helped us. Interesting though, it didn\u2019t really help us that much. I cant\u2019 say this, our performance in Florida, which is where you would see most of the Easter benefit. What\u2019s if that different wasn\u2019t any better than the other regions until the week of Easter, and then we definitely saw the fact that, so we have a still more people in Florida, what you hear in Florida is regardless of the calendar, people tend to stay, a lot of people tend to stay until Easter.", "So, it helped us, I think what really helped us a lot in March, Meredith was hurt us in January, February people. And good number parts of the country had been locked up in their homes, don\u2019t want to get out and dig it out more. So I would say, a late Easter helped us somewhat, but probably not as much as just the other side of the weather discussion.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "William J. DeLaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now move to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Kumar Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Yes. Hi, I hope you can hear me. First on business transformation, I know, Chris that you mentioned that you\u2019re capitalizing more of the project in shifting some of the allocation on expenses, I\u2019m just wondering if the merger development have had a impact on how you\u2019re looking at business transformation, do you have to cleave things in anyway based on the business transformation process that\u2019s going on entire well over US Foods. So I was just wondering in terms of the capital allocation priorities, if anything is changed.", "R. Chris Kreidler", "Yes. It seems like there are several questions there. So, tell me if I don\u2019t get all of them. We\u2019re obviously taking into consideration the integration planning and what may occur post merger, but in terms of how we report our business transformation today and we\u2019re going about our business today really not that much impact.", "So we\u2019re in planning phase for integration, but we\u2019re not allowing it to impact what we\u2019re doing from a business transformation perspective going after the benefits that the way look at the cost et cetera. What will impact it, and Bill alluded to it here a few minutes ago is, as we think about overlaying the merger into our company and especially from the business technology standpoint, we have to rethink about rollout schedules, we have to rethink how we\u2019re going to put the companies together technologically, that will have an impact and we\u2019re playing through various scenarios on that right now.", "Ajay Kumar Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. That was helpful and just in terms of the timing of the merger looks like you\u2019re still targeting closing by the end of September and just wondering, does that seem like a realistic timeframe based on how things are going with the FTC process and is that really providing enough time to get the necessary shareholder approval?", "R. Chris Kreidler", "Yes. We don\u2019t need the shareholder approval on their side. They essentially have it whenever they need it, but we still believe it\u2019s realistic timeframe. I think the way we would characterize our interactions with the FTC and the regulatory process that\u2019s pretty much as expected. We don\u2019t have any reason to believe that we will be significantly faster or slower than what we expected from the very beginning. So, we still think Q3 is realistic.", "Ajay Kumar Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. I just had one final question if I could. Can you just comment any further on inflation so far this quarter, I think Bill you talked about double-digit increases in certain categories, but just at an aggregate level of, how much is your cost of goods inflation right now compared to I guess it was around 1% from last quarter.", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes. We wouldn\u2019t necessarily give you anything forward-looking. I know we\u2019ve talked a little bit about April here and just because there is a trend in March we wanted to give you some color about what's going on with that trend? I think the way I characterize it, is we went from almost nothing which is at 1% to something. There are three very specific categories we called out that are kind of double-digit inflationary categories, but is built at the rest are really not an issue. They are either flat or even slightly down. So what average is out to certainly more than 1%, but that\u2019s not all will say and it\u2019s only April we\u2019ve got a couple more months before we build out the quarter.", "Ajay Kumar Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now move to Mark Wiltamuth with Jeffries.", "Mark G. Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Mark Wiltamuth at Jeffries. Is there any update for us on the net positivity you expect from business transformation? Now that you\u2019ve changed the accounting a little bit on how the costs are going to be done?", "R. Chris Kreidler", "The way that we are allocating cost really doesn\u2019t impact the benefit at all. We\u2019ve been tracking it for those who\u2019d followed us, yourself included Mark, of course. And the benefit side and the cost side, on the benefit side we said $600 million of benefit we had achieved over three years. Bill said in his prepared remarks, I\u2019d reiterate it, we are still on track to achieve that, we hit our numbers for the first year. At mid-year we said we were still on track, but this year and we reiterated we still believe we are going to hit those numbers for the three years combined. On the benefit side no change.", "What we are really talking about, what I refer to them the cost side. This is a long process and there is a lot going on and we are changing a lot. And as we go through this much change, we\u2019re having to take new looks at how we allocate cost, how we think about expenses et cetera. So we had some restatements, we\u2019ve talked about are not restatements, but adjusting the way we look at things and in this particular case we looked at the way we allocate our labor when we just said it is more precise to do with the new way.", "So I\u2019ve got two choices, I either have to restate or give you a new look at the guidance,", "using the new methodology which is what we opted to do or we\u2019ve to somehow go backward and tell you what it would have been in prior quarters, prior years and frankly that would have taken a lot more effort.", "So we are giving you a new set of guidance, based upon the new methodology. Our variance this year from the old guidance that $300 million to $350 million a year is really about half and half capitalization of labor and methodology change on how we actually account for the labor. So that\u2019s the change frankly, if we did it under the old methodology we\u2019d still be in the old guidance. So we are just changing the guidance, so we can report it differently going forward. It does not impact the benefits.", "Mark G. Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Okay, thank you. And on the point of attrition there\u2019s been all this chatter in the marketplace on potential loss of some customers in reaction to the US Foods merger. Any color on what the customers are saying what you\u2019ve been hearing from your side and is there any assurance that you\u2019re still retaining the customers on the US Foods side?", "William J. DeLaney", "Again, we are not going to comment on the US Foods side. But I would tell you from our perspective, we\u2019ve had an opportunity, very senior levels of management to speak with, virtually all of our top customers and at the local level our Presidents and VPs and salesmen out talking to many of their customers as well. And I think as time is going on people \u2013 we have been able to explain the reasons for the merger and the opportunities. And some of the challenges will come with that early days and transition and that kind of things.", "So I would characterize the visits with the customers out from our perspective is very constructive, largely supported. And there were a lot of questions as you can imagine one of their key questions is to what extent will this disrupt service that type of thing as we go through the transition. And obviously that is a big priority for us to minimize that type of things.", "So \u2013 so far I would say we had very good visits with our customers.", "Mark G. Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Okay, and then on the US Foods side, are they on the same ERP system as you. And how do you feel like that will go on transition in your system?", "R. Chris Kreidler", "Yes, they are not on our old system which was a kind of customized proprietary system for Sysco. They had their own somewhat customized proprietary system. They are not on SAP either. So the way we looked at this, and I think we talked about this a little bit is, each company has its system. We are moving towards SAP as a unifying system. We do believe and we asked it publicly that we think it\u2019s the right system for the combined entities post merger and so we will have to build the bridge, so that both systems can communicate and talk to each other in the near and medium term and then a new road map to eventually get it all to the new ERP platform overtime.", "Mark G. Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll now move to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning, thanks it\u2019s (indiscernible) for John. I guess the first question, you touched on a little bit, but would that say, P and I think 10 facilities now, it would seem like it would have a pretty decent sample size to compared to the baseline OPCOs, so I was just hoping maybe you could provide some more texture around where some of the most meaningful differentiation is coming versus the OPCOs that don\u2019t have the systems?", "Is it on a profitability side? Is it in case volume growth? Are you just generally getting better customer feedback around the execution, just some color around that would be great?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I would say 10 companies, well we are pleased with that, the scheme of 70 is still early days, and our focus is, as I pointed out in my comments over the last six to 12 months has been more about stabilizing the system and improving the performances. And we see that in those companies, so on the sale side in terms of the speed of the system that type of thing, we made a lot of very good strides there.", "Our service levels continue to improve and get toward the level of our legacy companies if you will. We saw a lot of opportunities to manage the inventory more efficiently and effectively and we are working on some things there. So we are pleased with the progress that we are making, but I wouldn\u2019t want to get into discussion relative to the legacy companies because it\u2019s still earlier days.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, and then I just changing gears a little bit, we don\u2019t haven\u2019t talked about in a lot recently, but I guess where from your perspective obviously you have many things going on right now. But where is Sysco ventures might fit in terms of your priorities, from a longer-term perspective especially given the fact that with the scale that you have \u2013 you probably have a trove of information about what\u2019s working on restaurant customers\u2019 menus from both the sales and profitability standpoint. So it seems like it\u2019d be \u2013 something that could be a pretty major differentiation for you versus maybe other competitors in the space?", "William J. DeLaney", "We think, ventures is a key strategic opportunity for us. We are beginning to gain traction and we put together the platform with the company called Leapset about a year-ago. We\u2019ve rolled out certain solutions in certain markets we are seeing some progress there. We still have a big opportunity here to get it more integrated into the business. We\u2019ve made some progress there and working with several solutions, there are more solutions to come.", "So I would agree with you that with this merger it give us an even stronger platform in terms of customers to leverage this capability and to build stronger more effective relationships with a greater number of customers. So it\u2019s a key part of our strategy, and I think, as we get deeper into the merger planning work, we\u2019ll be able to speak more specifically in terms of work structure and that type of things in terms of how we are going to drive it out.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay great and just lastly in terms of the CapEx, I guess Chris directionally going forward, obviously you\u2019ve got the merger going on but with some of the fleet optimization initiatives, and maybe with some of the business transformation initiatives being completed. Is CapEx directionally likely to step-down from that $500 million to $550 net of asset sales? Or is it something that kind of like a stable level of investment that\u2019s going to be on going?", "R. Chris Kreidler", "It is a good question. Our goal has not been on a specific dollar amount of more around the 1% to 1.2% of sales, which we rapidly approaching and so when we get to that level and preferably the lower end of that level we\u2019ll feel like we\u2019ve got the right amount of base capital that should be able to grow every year as we grow the business through volume growth.", "Now overlay that the merger and yes, we\u2019ve got to take a new look at that we are. We\u2019ve got a lot of people working through what that\u2019s going to mean in terms of, what I\u2019ll call one-time capital to make the networks work well together. Toast with that we\u2019ll have to reevaluate. I got a personal believe that we should be able to get long-term run rate capital down to the low end of our range if not even slightly below that range is based upon scale. But that remains to be proven out in several years off.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Very helpful, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now move to Erin Lash with Morningstar.", "Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar Research", "Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to touch on some of the \u2013 has been the two had been doing and your partnership with Robert Irvine over the past couple of years and how effective that has been or maybe hasn\u2019t been?", "William J. DeLaney", "Hi Erin, look we think it\u2019s been very effective in the year two, right now, with chef Irvine and as we\u2019ve talked about in the past one the reasons, we partnered with him and through Network is roughly 70% of our customers tune into that Network on a regular basis and in particular watch his shows. So he has been a great ambassador for Sysco both through the Network as well as personal appearances and working with our OPCOs and doing some nice work as well in the communities.", "So we are very pleased with that partnership and we\u2019ve got some new ads that are going to be coming out this year. And I think, you\u2019ll continue to see is a significant positive for us from a marketing standpoint.", "R. Chris Kreidler", "I also say it\u2019s given our marketing associates a lot to be excited about we get that feedback constantly from our MAs so that positive is well for our system.", "Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar Research", "Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful. And then I just wanted to ask about, the Sysco brand overall, and I think you are going to make some investments behind this Sysco brand and how to better to help that I think in front of customers and I was wondering what kind of the mixes between the Sysco brand and private label and how those affect our progressing?", "William J. DeLaney", "You\u2019re talking about the product brand or the corporate brand, Erin?", "Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar Research", "The product within the product sales?", "William J. DeLaney", "Yes, I think what you are referring to us over the last year you\u2019re seeing the numbers pick-up a little bit in terms of the street are the local and that\u2019s been good. But I would also quickly say, as we go through and do the category management work and our customer insights work, we are trying to strike the right balance between what customers want and need, and how our brand line is up with that as opposed to just trying to push our brand out there for the second push in the brand.", "So I\u2019m actually very pleased with the work that\u2019s been done in the merchandised area over the last couple of three years in terms of going through and looking at all the specs in our various categories, as we even we before the category management work started but in conjunction without now as well as combining that with our customer insight work so, we don\u2019t have a particular number in mind necessarily we are just trying to strike the right balance with our customers where we really do have a value-added product, we wanted to make sure that we\u2019re positioning it properly.", "Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar Research", "Thank you very much.", "William J.

Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Shannon Mutschler", "Thanks, Aaron. Good morning everyone and welcome to Sysco\u2019s FQ4 2014 Earnings Call.

", "To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions today we\u2019d like to ask each participant to limit their time to one question and one follow-up. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer Bill DeLaney.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you, Shannon. Good morning everyone, thank you for joining us today. Sysco\u2019s financial results announced this morning reflect a year of significant challenges, tremendous change and solid progress on multiple fronts. While the business environment remained challenging throughout the year and contributed to financial results that fell short of our initial expectations we did have many successes during the year.", "Sales for the fiscal year grew 5% to $47 billion and adjusted net earnings were $1 billion. Cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $1.5 billion and free cash flow excluding the impact of certain items was $1.1 billion. We reduced our operating expenses per case by $0.06. We continued to implement transformational change on a broad scale throughout Sysco and remain on track to achieve our targeted three-year business transformation benefits in F2015.", "We recommenced the rollout of our technology platform with much improved stability and performance. We increased our dividend during this past year, the 45th time since our founding in 1970. In total we distributed nearly $670 million in dividends to shareholders during F2014 and repurchased more than $330 million in stock. And we announced our intention to merge with US Foods which will provide substantial benefits to our customers and help us achieve more scale and efficiency in an evolving and highly competitive marketplace.", "Turning to our results for the quarter, sales grew 5.9% to $12.3 billion and net earnings were $254 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter which was flat compared to the prior-year period. While we did experience more expense pressure during the quarter than we had through the first three quarters we are pleased with the 4% increase in gross profit we achieved.", "Inflation increased significantly at the end of Q3 and was 4.1% for Q4, contributing to our sales and gross profit growth while also pressuring our gross margin. However, a more beneficial mix of our local and corporate managed sales mitigated some of this pressure during the quarter. Our results reflect the impact of the slow and modest economic recovery in a food service industry that as a whole remains under pressure.", "During the June quarter restaurant industry data indicates that some sequential market improvement occurred but year-over-year industry sales growth continues to be modest and traffic patterns remain stagnant. It\u2019s important to note that while restaurant traffic was essentially flat for our fiscal year Sysco\u2019s case volume grew more than 2% excluding the impact of acquisitions.", "During the year we made significant progress in achieving our business transformation strategic initiatives that are aimed at implementing an enterprise resource planning or ERP technology platform, lowering product costs, and reducing our operating expense structure. ", "Regarding our technology initiative in July we implemented our new ERP platform in our Salt Lake City and Albuquerque operating companies. In the past eight months we have successfully deployed seven operating companies under the new platform, bringing the total to twelve. Several of these recent deployments took place at some of our larger and more complex operating companies and many conversions occurred during a particularly busy time of year. We continued to learn and adjust with each go-live and as a result each one has been progressively more successful.", "As disclosed previously we will focus for the remainder of the calendar year on implementing an SAP software version upgrade and further developing IT-related merger integration and sequencing plans. Our goal with the latter is to prioritize SAP implementation where it will help us achieve targeted synergies as soon as possible with minimal disruption to our customers. We will also continue to work to enhance the scalability of our shared business services processes to prepare for more conversions in the future. Our confidence has grown as we have gained more experience with our ERP conversions and we believe we have a solid foundation from which to move forward.", "As we continued to implement our category management initiative this year we also focused on enhancing our execution of this effort in several important ways. We developed and implemented new field-ready sales tools, enhanced our customer service in support of this initiative, and improved communication and coordination with the field. Looking ahead we expect to launch the remainder of the categories in scope into the market by the end of F2015.", "Regarding our operating initiatives during the year we continued to roll out our routing optimization project which is resulting in reduced routes and miles driven while improving on-time deliveries. We completed the conversion of our largest operating companies during the year and expect to complete the remaining by the end of F2015. ", "Our fleet and equipment optimization initiative will reduce costs and optimize our capital spend as we move forward. During the year we established standard terms and specifications for fleet and warehouse equipment purchases and expect to complete the rationalization of our fleet by the end of this fiscal year. ", "We also continued to implement our driver and warehouse incentive pay program, increased the application of best practices, and implemented tools to more effectively manage labor costs and expenses. In one of our US broad line markets we successfully piloted a program that increased the amount of recycled material in our operations by 75%. We expect to roll out this program across the country by the end of this calendar year which will also reduce costs.", "It is appropriate to note at this point that much of the progress we have made in the last few years in driving out key strategic business initiatives has been led by Mike Green, Executive Vice President of Foodservice Operations. Mike recently announced his intention to retire at the end of the calendar year after a very distinguished 24-year career at Sysco. We wish Mike great success as he moves on to the next chapter of his life and we thank him for his service and many contributions to Sysco.", "Turning to an update on the status of the US Foods merger, last week we announced a future senior leadership team that will report to me following the closing of the merger. This is an important step that will allow us to make further progress in our integration planning efforts, and I look forward to working closely with this team post-close. We also continue to work closely with the FTC as they review the transaction. Our discussions have been productive to date and are progressing as anticipated. We expect the merger to close either late in Q3 or in Q4.", "In closing I\u2019m very encouraged with our progress during F2014 in strengthening our management team and enhancing our capabilities to serve our customers more effectively and operate our business more efficiently. I\u2019m very grateful to all of our associates for their hard work and dedication throughout F2014. The scope, breadth, and pace of change at Sysco during the year has been remarkable and importantly has provided us a solid foundation to take the next step in our transformational journey as we prepare for our proposed merger with US Foods.", "Now I\u2019ll turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for Q4 and the fiscal year.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning everyone. For Q4 sales were $12.3 billion or an increase of 5.9% compared to the prior year. Food costs inflation was 4.1% driven mainly by inflation in the meat, dairy and seafood categories. In addition, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.6% and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0.7%. Case volume grew 2.2% during the quarter including acquisitions and approximately 2.1% excluding acquisitions.", "Gross profit in Q4 increased 4.0% and gross margin declined 31 basis points to 17.55%. During our May earnings call we indicated that inflation jumped substantially at the end of March. That trend continued and we saw a meaningful increase in inflation throughout the quarter. The overall rate was driven by inflation in the meat, seafood and dairy categories which together total more than one-third of our annual sales. ", "We believe the rapid and marked increase in inflation during the period contributed to the sequential and year-over-year decline in gross margin; however, as Bill mentioned we also experienced a more beneficial mix of our local and corporate managed sales that mitigated some of this pressure during Q4.", "Operating expenses totaled $1.7 billion in F4Q 2014 including $58.0 million in certain items. Excluding certain items, which mainly related to merger and integration planning expenses, operating expenses increased $78 million or 4.9% driven mainly by increased corporate and delivery costs and incremental expenses from acquired companies. Operating income for the quarter was down 7.7% year-over-year. After adjusting for certain items operating income increased 1.2%.", "Net earnings for Q4 were $254 million, a decrease of $29 million or 10.2% compared to the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.43, an 8.5% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 which was flat compared to the prior year.", "Now, turning to the year-over-year comparison, sales increased 4.7% or $2.1 billion. Product costs inflation was 2.1% driven mainly by inflation in the meat, seafood and dairy categories. In addition, sales from acquisitions increased sales by 1.4% and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates for the fiscal year decreased sales by 0.6%. Case volume grew 3.4% during the fiscal year including acquisitions and approximately 2.2% excluding acquisitions.", "Gross profit increased 2.3% during the year while gross margin decreased 42 basis points year-over-year to 17.59% due mainly to weak restaurant traffic and competitive pressures. Operating expenses totaled $6.6 billion in F2014 including $150 million in certain items which primarily related to merger and integration planning expenses, a change in Sysco\u2019s self-insurance reserve, and a legal settlement. ", "Excluding certain items operating expenses increased $201 million or 3.2% primarily due to new costs from acquired companies, higher delivery and corporate expenses, higher payroll costs and higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by lower sales organization costs and a decrease in retirement-related expense.", "Operating costs per case excluding certain items declined year-over-year by $0.06, exceeding one of our key objectives for the year. As we\u2019ve discussed previously it is very difficult simply to hold operating costs per case flat due to typical inflationary pressures. This result reflects the significant impact from business transformation benefits during the year. Operating income was $1.6 billion, declining $71 million or 4.3% for the fiscal year. Excluding certain items operating income declined 0.9%.", "Net earnings for F2014 were $932 million, decreasing $61 million or 6.1% compared to the prior year. F2014 EPS was $1.58, a decline of 5.4%. Excluding certain items EPS was $1.76 compared to $1.78 in the prior year.", "Reflecting on our financial results for F2014 our overall results fell short of our expectations. However, if you look at the two halves of the year separately they were vastly different. The first half of the year saw low inflation, weak local sales growth, and weak gross profit growth of 1.2%. ", "During the second half of the year inflation picked up as did local sales growth. Gross profits grew at a more robust rate of 3.4% in the second half of the year and 4.0% during Q4 in part driven by the increasing impacts from our business transformation initiatives. We are encouraged by the trends we have seen in the second half of the year and we are working hard to maintain and improve upon them for F2015. ", "Business transformation expenses totaled $277 million in F2014 which was lower by $54 million for the year. Similar to what we discussed last quarter, roughly half of the variance year-to-date relates to a change that we made in how we allocate internal labor costs to the project. ", "Prior to F2014 we allocated the costs of internal associates based upon the percentage of time they spent on the project. We are now allocating either all or none of an associate\u2019s cost to the project depending on whether they spent the majority of their time on the project. This has had the effect of shifting some expense from business transformation expense to general corporate expense.", "The remainder of the year-to-date variance in business transformation expense is the result of capitalizing more of the work effort than originally estimated. Had we not experienced these changes total expenses would have been within our original guidance range of $300 million to $350 million.", "As of the end of F2014 we were ahead of our business transformation benefit goals, achieving significant progress across multiple areas of our business. These efforts allowed us to exceed our cost per case objective and to mitigate the pressure on gross margins.", "Total capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales totaled $497 million for the fiscal year, which was essentially flat compared to last year. This result was just slightly lower than our guidance of $500 million to $550 million. Free cash flow adjusted for the impact of certain items was $1.1 billion for the fiscal year, increasing approximately 3% compared to the prior-year period.", "Looking ahead I\u2019d like to provide some guidance for key metrics as we typically do at this time of year to set expectations for the coming fiscal year. Please keep in mind that this guidance is for our current business only and does not include any impact from the proposed merger with US Foods. We anticipate providing additional guidance for the combined companies following the close of the transaction.", "As we\u2019ve stated previously our long-term sales growth expectations are for sales to fall in a range of 4% to 6% annually. We believe this long-term guidance continues to be reasonable. This is nominal sales growth so it includes the impact of inflation which we assume will return to more modest historic levels. ", "With regards to our three-year business transformation initiatives, we were well ahead of our objectives after years one and two. As we enter the third year of the initiatives we expect to achieve or exceed the high end of the $550 million to $650 million objective that we established two years ago. ", "As a result, we expect that continued momentum and achieving lower cost of goods from our category management and sourcing initiatives will continue to help mitigate gross margin pressure from the intensely competitive marketplace. In addition we expect our business transformation initiatives will contribute to meet our objective of holding operating costs per case excluding certain items flat year-over-year in our North American broad line business. ", "We expect corporate expenses will be higher, reflecting investments we are making to provide important new capabilities such as the new revenue management function and the implementation of organizational changes that we believe will drive greater functional support in our broad line operations. In addition we expect to make various investments in certain core technology resources. While the absolute dollar amount of expenses will be higher year-over-year our objective is to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than gross profit growth. Lastly, we expect capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales to be in a range of $500 million to $550 million. ", "Turning to the pending US Foods merger, we continue to make progress in our integration planning efforts which are focused around three areas \u2013 day one readiness, value creation, and long-term organizational design. While we continue to work to finalize our synergy targets and the pace at which we will achieve these synergies we remain confident that we will be able to achieve or exceed the level of synergies we\u2019ve previously communicated.", "Regarding the regulatory process, our dialog with the FTC continues to be productive and is progressing as expected. We continue to believe that this merger will benefit customers and help us become more efficient in an evolving and competitive marketplace and also believe the FTC will agree that our customers have many choices in the fiercely competitive marketplace in which we operate today. As Bill mentioned we expect the merger to close either late in Q3 or in Q4.", "Finally I\u2019d like to take the opportunity to welcome our new Vice President of Investor Relations, Derrick Vialis, who joined us most recently from BMC Software. Derrick has significant experience in IR and finance and has been publicly recognized by the investment community for his professionalism and financial acumen. We are very pleased to have him join our team.", "I would also like to take a moment to thank Shannon for stepping up to lead the IR team on an interim basis while we conducted our search for a permanent leader. Because of her leadership and efforts we didn\u2019t miss a beat. Once Shannon helps Derrick get up to speed she\u2019s going to transition into a new role here at Sysco heading up our sustainability efforts. I know you will join me in wishing her success in her new role.", "In closing, while F2014 included its share of challenges we are excited about the progress in transforming our business and our integration planning efforts related to the US Foods merger. While we continue to have much work ahead of us we strongly believe that we are making the right strategic investments to strengthen our leadership position in the industry. With that, Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions.) And we\u2019ll go first to Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Hi, good morning, thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the ERP rollout. I know that you guys made some commentary earlier about how each one is really doing better than the one that was done prior to, so can you just talk a little bit, give us some color around what is new and what are you learning from the previous rollouts that you\u2019re putting into the newer ones?", "Bill DeLaney", "Sure Vincent, I\u2019ll take a shot at that one. So as we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks we\u2019ve done about seven during the last eight or nine months \u2013 we did five in the fiscal year and just did two more here in July. I would say to you if you go back a year, a year and a half it goes beyond even the deployment, but the system itself is more stable today and then as we do deploy I believe we\u2019re doing a better job working with our people in the field, preparing them, making sure we\u2019re understanding what their challenges are so that not only do we have a good go-live weekend but once the system is live that we\u2019re able to operate the business with fewer glitches, that type of thing.", "So there\u2019s still challenges. I would say two examples of things that are better is our service levels continue to come up and come back faster than what they did originally. And I would also tell you in some of the early conversions we would have some issues, especially with larger customers, that type of thing that, not to say that we don\u2019t have any today but I think we\u2019re much more coordinated internally with our corporate sales group and with our op cos as well as with the deployment team to plan for those challenges, anticipate them, handle them when they come up. But as we said in the text here learn from each one so that there\u2019s fewer issues as we go forward.", "So we\u2019ve always done pretty well on the go-live weekends. I would just say post-conversion we\u2019re able to operate the business better; the systems, the performance of the systems is faster, it\u2019s more stable; on the sales side generally much fewer issues today with our sales force and our customers in terms of some of the basics on order entry, that kind of thing.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Okay, thank you. And one just quick follow-up if I may: with inflation I know you said you were expecting it to return to kind of more modest levels. Have you been seeing some evidence of changes within those three particular categories that you called out this quarter?", "Bill DeLaney", "We haven\u2019t seen it yet. I think what we\u2019re saying is people that we all follow and just looking at some overview reports on commodities and that type of thing, and just the math of this thing as you get into the last third of next year we would expect it to subside some. But at this point it\u2019s still very comparable to what we\u2019ve seen in the last three or four months.", "Vincent Sinisi \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Okay, great. Thanks very much, good luck.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Yeah hi, good morning guys. A quick question for you on expense growth: it was a little bit higher than what we expected this quarter. It seems like, and I might be wrong but it seems like cost per case may have been up this quarter and it was down I guess for the first three quarters of the year. Can you maybe just talk about what is going on with expenses and then how we should sort of think about it from here?", "Bill DeLaney", "Yeah, why don\u2019t we tag team this one, Ed? So I would say it was up and more than what we would have liked to have seen, and there\u2019s two pieces to it which Chris took you through on the operations side. ", "Our delivery costs, we\u2019re still having some challenges there. We\u2019re doing some good things on delivery but there\u2019s challenges in the labor market, in certain markets we\u2019ve had some basic issues that we could have managed better I think on comp and that type of thing. So there\u2019s still some transition. Even though we\u2019re putting in some good initiatives on the delivery side it\u2019s still early days; it takes some time for those to get traction. And delivery\u2019s always the hardest expense to manage, but we should do better than what we\u2019re doing there right now and I would expect us to as the new year goes along.", "The second part of it was more conscious on our part that Chris alluded to, where you know, we\u2019ve got some good things going on here with cat man and revenue management. There are some areas where we need to invest in the technology infrastructure beyond the SAP platform and so we have begun to make those investments. So we did that consciously and those are the right things to be doing for the company, not just in the short-term, in the mid-term. So we could have, probably should have managed the expenses a little bit better. Again, I\u2019m real pleased with the gross profit dollar growth and hopefully you\u2019ll see that get calibrated more effectively here as we go into the new year.", "Chris Kreidler", "Hi Ed, the only thing I\u2019ll add on the cost per case, your specific question of whether it was up in Q4, it was actually. If you recall a couple of quarters ago when I was commenting about where we are versus our nickel, we were actually pretty far ahead of our nickel per case reduction \u2013 I think at the time we were $0.09 or $0.10 down. ", "And I was telegraphing that while we thought we\u2019d beat the nickel I wasn\u2019t expecting us to maintain the $0.09 or $0.10, and the reason for that is the delivery costs kind of plagued us throughout the year. They continued to be up and we were lapping some of the SG&A benefits that we got from the selling costs and some of the G&A costs as well. So we actually knew that coming into Q4 if we didn\u2019t start to make some headway on the delivery costs that we were probably going ot have a reversal in Q4, which is what happened.", "So I\u2019ll agree with Bill. I think there are things we can and should be doing and doing better and we continue to work on those, but that\u2019s kind of the color on the cost per case. And the answer on the corporate costs was dead on.", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Okay, and then just to follow up on gross profit per case, you did a nice job this quarter of growing gross profit ahead of case growth again this quarter. Could you just maybe talk about, maybe a little bit more about the drivers? How much is internal, things like category management versus mix versus what\u2019s going on from a competition standpoint and how that\u2019s impacting you? Any color behind the driver there and then the sustainability of this trend would be helpful, thank you.", "Bill DeLaney", "Well I think, Ed, as we said and I know it\u2019s kind of a recurring theme here but that\u2019s the reality of our business right now \u2013 the marketplace continues to be highly competitive. Our customers are under a lot of pressure from the consumer to offer innovative experiences in food and presentations and to do it more and more cost-effectively. So obviously we need to be more responsive and we are responsive to that. So there\u2019s a macro headwind that we continue to fight.", "In terms of where the mitigation of the improvements are coming from, I think from all the areas you just mentioned. I think certainly since late last fall we\u2019ve done a better job managing our margins I think more effectively internally. I think you are seeing some benefits of cat man begin to become more pronounced. The mix did help a little bit this quarter. It\u2019s more of a balanced mix between locally managed customer growth and sales growth and corporate managed. Inflation helped some too, there. ", "So we\u2019re kind of at a point where inflation\u2019s probably a little bit higher than what we\u2019d like to see right now certainly in those three categories but it is a little bit of a tailwind as it relates to that, to the margin dollar growth. But at the same time it\u2019s more difficult to pass that price increase along to our customers as fast as we might like, and I think as we said on the last call in most instances we frankly shouldn\u2019t pass along that fast and we have to manage that as best we can. So it\u2019s coming from all areas.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. ", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities ", "So Bill, going back to the gross margin topic, two things \u2013 what was the cadence of pass through roughly, because again, it looked at first glance that it was perhaps a little more rapid than I would have guessed but it sounds like it wasn\u2019t. And then secondly, with the mix changes was that more tactical, some course corrections or more strategic that\u2019s been brewing for a while?", "Bill DeLaney", "Probably I\u2019d plead tactical on the latter. We feel we\u2019re running our locally managed business better. We put this company and in particular our sales force and op cos and customers through a lot with a lot of these initiatives, and many of them either directly, John, or indirectly impacted our salespeople and to some extent our customers. So we\u2019ve cycled a lot of that on the sales side and now we\u2019ve gotten the benefits from it, but I think things are a little more stable on that front. ", "We\u2019re able to focus more, and like I said we\u2019re giving them better tools to support the cat man rollout, (inaudible) revenue management work is starting to gain some traction. So yeah, I think we\u2019re doing a better job managing the local business. It\u2019s still modest growth but it\u2019s growth. I would be fine with a little bit more growth on the corporate side; it just so happens it\u2019s moderated to some degree so there is no big, strategic initiative there. We are obviously always trying to get better at the profitability and how we manage the profitability of the business. ", "So I think it\u2019s mostly that we\u2019re managing the locally side better. As far as the first part can you take me through that question again? I\u2019m not really sure I understood it.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities ", "Yeah, I was curious how you\u2019re managing the pace of pass through. You had a big step up sequentially, that\u2019s always challenging. Again, it looked at first glance like you probably got a lot of pass through one during the quarter but my guess is that\u2019s not the case, right?", "Bill DeLaney", "Well I don\u2019t know exactly how you\u2019re interpreting the data. We got 4% GP growth on 2% case growth and 6% sales growth, so I\u2019d say we got our fair share but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s more or less. I think our people do a really good job responding to the environment that they\u2019re in and trying to make good decisions on how much to pass along, when to pass along, how to work with the customer to find ways to cut their costs so that they don\u2019t have to pass along as much to their customers or to the consumers. So yeah, I think we\u2019re getting better at it, John, but I wouldn\u2019t say we necessarily passed on as much as theoretically we could have.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities ", "Alright. And then lastly you talked about \u201915 operating expense growth being less than gross profit growth. Is that more expense growth being ratcheted back or just with the prevalence of inflation here GP dollar growth is going to be a bit elevated because of that for the next couple of quarters?", "Chris Kreidler", "John, that commentary was mainly just to help a little bit with expectations for \u201915 and how are we going to look at whether we\u2019re spending too much money on operating expenses or not. We clearly want to grow gross profit dollars as much as we can where as we\u2019ve talked in the last few quarters we\u2019re struggling with a number of things on that front right now and we think we\u2019re seeing some good trends on that front. But in the meantime we\u2019ve always got to control operating expenses. So that\u2019s the governor we\u2019re putting on it \u2013 we\u2019re not going to get operating expenses grow faster than gross profit dollars, not in our planning anyway.", "I think the only other color I\u2019d put on it is as Bill commented, we\u2019ve stood up some capabilities here at corporate and in the field that we think, both new functions and strengthening existing functions, that we think are going to add a lot of value. You take some upfront costs to put those in place and then they\u2019re in your run rate, so the growth rate should diminish over time because those are now built into your run rate.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities ", "Alright, thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.", "Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hey there. Just a couple questions on the integration costs. It looks like obviously you\u2019ve given us $90 million for the year-to-date integration, and I guess I was just wondering if you could give us a little more color on what exactly goes into those costs just to get a sense of kind of how far you are along?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, the vast majority of those costs is what I\u2019d call professional fees, so between our integration consultants, McKinsey and other third parties that are helping us in each of the different functional areas prepare for the integration, do the planning work for that. There\u2019s just a lot of external cost that goes into that. We also throw into that categorization anybody that is fulltime on the integration project, which is not a large number of people but we make sure that we pull those expenses out as well.", "Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of corporate for next year just remind me, is this Q4 the first time that we\u2019ve had this change in the allocation of the expenses in the corporate, because corporate was quite a bit higher in Q4 than what I would have expected.", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re referring to about changing the-", "Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "In terms of the labor allocation, instead of allocating any labor hours you were either all allocated, it was either all allocated to corporate or not?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, no, with regards to the ERP project that\u2019s actually a change that we put in place at the beginning of the fiscal year so no, that wasn\u2019t a Q4-only impact.", "Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So what would have driven the higher corporate specifically this Q4, and then I guess the follow-on is this kind of Q4 run rate the right type of number to use for next year, because obviously if we use that it would be up and would not be consistent with your guidance. I\u2019m just wondering how much higher it could be.", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right run rate to use for next year. We obviously can\u2019t give you an actual run rate or a percentage number to use. I think you guys have to build something into your models. As I said earlier, we stood up some functionality; we started taking some increased expenses in Q3 and in Q4 for that. You\u2019ll eventually lap that so on a growth basis you won\u2019t see that particular piece of the growth going forward. So that\u2019s part of what occurred in the corporate, and there\u2019s some other stuff that\u2019s in there as well but it\u2019s certainly not a run rate that we expect to continue.", "Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then just a last question, in the press release that you issued last week with the new positions, I guess there were two positions that stuck out to me at least as being fairly new to Sysco \u2013 the Lead of Sysco\u2019s Domestic and International Operations as well as the Lead on End-to-End Supply Chain both joined in 2013. I\u2019m just wondering those obviously seem like fairly significant roles in terms of the combined company \u2013 maybe just some color there given that they both joined fairly recently.", "Bill DeLaney", "Sure. Let me make sure you\u2019re talking about Tom Ben\u00e9 over in Operations and Scott Charlton over Supply Chain, Karen?", "Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yep.", "Bill DeLaney", "Yeah, so these gentlemen are both folks that have joined us here over the last year, year and a half. Tom has twenty plus years with Pepsi and Scott has twenty plus years in multiple areas, retail grocers but big types of supply chain background. So they both have come in. Tom has spent the last 15 months or so building his presence, both working with our merchandising team initially, getting cat man rolled out to the field; and then beyond that has gotten more involved in sales and marketing and some of the inbound aspects of supply chain over the last 9 to 12 months. So two very highly experienced people that have been great additions to the team and have great capabilities, so we\u2019re very excited about it.", "Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks for taking my questions. I think, Chris, one of the recent questions you were asked was about these investments and I was just wondering, particularly technology investments, if you can quantify that and give us some sense of the cadence of those costs?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, I\u2019m just trying to think about what I said that would lead to that specific type of question. So we\u2019ve continued to spend on technology. Most of our expenditures on technology have been around the ERP implementation, so within business transformation; and we kind of called out those expenses, and on a kind of like-for-like methodology they were right in line with our guidance of $300 million to $350 million. ", "We didn\u2019t spend substantially more on technology if you will during F2014 than we expected to spend, so while there\u2019s an uptick there it\u2019s not a sizable uptick. What we\u2019re calling out for \u201915 in terms of guidance is there is a little bit more that we anticipate spending for next year. It\u2019s not going to be huge, huge dollars but there\u2019s going to be a little bit more. ", "As we roll into the new year we\u2019re going to look at perhaps calling out some additional guidance around technology spend in total, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re talking about internally. It\u2019s a big part of our budget. We understand that; we also think it\u2019s a big part of our competitive advantage so it\u2019s something that we may give more color to as we move forward.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, I was just hoping to get that color now as I work on my model for next year. I have I think sort of almost a housekeeping question: it sounds like you\u2019ve made great progress in rolling out ERP. Could you talk about how many facilities in total you intend to implement the technology?", "Bill DeLaney", "Well, we\u2019ve rolled it out to a dozen, Meredith, and we\u2019ve got 70 give or take in the US today. So I would say that 70 would be the target. Obviously that doesn\u2019t include Canada and we\u2019ll deal with that when we get there. The bigger point I think and what we alluded to in my comments was that with the merger on the horizon here we\u2019re going to focus on some updates to the software packages themselves and put together as best we can a cohesive deployment integration plan, factoring in obviously the new facilities and the new businesses that will come in from US. So it\u2019s 70 today and we haven\u2019t determined in totality yet how many operations we\u2019ll have going forward. So it\u2019ll be clearly more than that; it\u2019ll be less than the two together, I can tell you that.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.", "Bill DeLaney", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies ", "Hi, good morning. Just want to know if you\u2019ve found any other insights in working in that clean room with US Foods \u2013 any new insights on synergies or are things tracking as you had originally thought?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, Mark, they don\u2019t let me in the clean room so I really can\u2019t tell you much.", "Bill DeLaney", "There\u2019s nobody on this call that can handle clean room insights, Mark. [laughter]", "Chris Kreidler", "You know, Mark, it\u2019s a good question and let me just take it up to maybe 50,000 feet because I think that\u2019s the essence of your question anyway. What I said in my prepared remarks I\u2019ll obviously stick to. The more we get into this, the more work that we do, the more integration planning that we\u2019re able to do especially around value capture the more confident we get that we will be able to meet or exceed the guidance that we\u2019ve already put on the table. We\u2019ll obviously come out with more information when we\u2019re ready but yeah, we\u2019ve gotten quite a bit of confidence as we\u2019ve been into the details.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies ", "Okay. And how much timing do you need to really close things from the point that you get a decision out of FTC?", "Chris Kreidler", "I\u2019ve got to be careful how I answer that because the term \u201cwhen you get a decision from the FTC,\u201d I think I\u2019ll answer it this way: once we know that we\u2019re allowed to close the transaction we\u2019ll close it as rapidly as possible, so literally within a very, very short period of time so that we can begin the integration process.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies ", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald. ", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald ", "Yeah, hi, good morning. First on business transformation on the rollout, so far it seems like the operating companies that have been converted seem to have a very regional profile. So do you have any plans to convert companies on the East Coast for example? Can you give any plans for the rollout to other regions, and also maybe comment on why you\u2019re focusing on any particular geographies at this time? Thanks.", "Bill DeLaney", "Yeah, Ajay, we actually consciously went to more of a regional focus in the Southwest and then up into the Mountain states, and the original plan was then to do the Mountain market and come back and finish the Southwest. Those early conversions were a little bumpier, we needed some time to go back there and address some issues, that kind of thing. But again, with the merger on the horizon I can\u2019t really tell you. ", "So on a steady state basis I think you\u2019d find us finished up in those two regions or markets and then we\u2019d go to a third. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s a better way to do these types of things. You get leadership engagement, both the market leadership level and the op cos tend to work together on a lot of things \u2013 it just creates more of a team type of approach. So we\u2019ve actually found that to be quite successful and that\u2019s a change we made about a year, year and a half ago. Again, going forward I\u2019m going to defer I think until we get to where we have clear visibility as to what the whole landscape looks like post-merger.", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald ", "Okay. But there\u2019s no structural impediment to rolling out to other regions.", "Bill DeLaney", "No. We have RDCs, you know, a big RDC in the Northeast and one in Florida so there was some work that we needed to do to prepare for that, but it\u2019s not an impediment, it just needed a little bit more time. There\u2019s no impediments.", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald ", "Okay. And I think Chris talked about the shift in allocation from business transformation expenses to ordinary operating expenses. And this is a follow-up to Karen\u2019s question earlier \u2013 I had a question as to whether the opposite is true in the case of integration and planning costs for US Foods. So first as a comment, I know you talked about consulting fees but it seems like the costs that you\u2019re absorbing are merger expenses, it seems very high especially given that things are still in the review process and it sounds like that review is taking longer than you previously expected. ", "But in terms of how you\u2019re allocating those costs, is it possible that if the merger was not happening that some of those expense, like certain headcount expenses for example that you\u2019re currently allocating towards integration, that those would otherwise be considered ordinary operating expenses? I\u2019m just trying to confirm if all those integration costs are incremental.", "Chris Kreidler", "It\u2019s a very good question, Ajay, and I think we could have a robust debate about it. We actually, I believe I\u2019ve been fairly conservative about what goes into those categories. We\u2019re not putting in the cost of a lot of folks that are working a lot on merger integration planning because they also have their fulltime jobs, and so we\u2019re being pretty judicious about what goes in there. Your comment about professional fees, believe me, I wish they were much lower but these types of services and this type of experience comes with a hefty price tag and so we are paying a significant amount of dollars to be prepared. ", "And while I respect your comment that it doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019re very far in the process, believe me there\u2019s a regulatory process that occurs in the background and we\u2019re going to continue to say it\u2019s pretty much going as expected. But in the foreground you\u2019re doing a tremendous amount of planning to be ready the day that you close the transaction. And so we\u2019ve had a fairly large group of people allocated into 30 different business functional teams working in each of these areas on how to merge the two companies on day one, how to go after the value capture and synergies, and then how to design their organizations. ", "There\u2019s been a tremendous amount of work that\u2019s been done and we\u2019ve had external consultancy professionals helping us all along the way. So it\u2019s a tremendous amount of work that\u2019s been done, a lot of hard work by a lot of people that is reflected in these dollars as well as the hours so that when the thing is approved you\u2019re ready to go. Unfortunately you can\u2019t wait for it to be approved and then decide that you\u2019re going to plan for how to integrate the two companies together. It\u2019s something we have to do every day.", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald ", "Okay, and if I can just ask one final question \u2013 I wanted to ask about your recent investment in Iowa Premium Beef. That seems like a nontraditional type of venture for Sysco so I\u2019m just wondering if that signifies anything. Are you looking to potentially get more involved in food processing and be more fully integrated in food production?", "Bill DeLaney", "I think all it signifies, Ajay, great question, is we see an opportunity to partner with some really quality people in that business and to create a premium product, a value-added product which we believe will create more traction with our sales force and with our customers. So I think you could see us do niche type of investments in the future but that\u2019s an opportunity that came our way and we\u2019re moving forward with it, but I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it.", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald ", "Okay, thank you.", "Bill DeLaney", "Sure.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Thanks, good morning. Given really how quickly the inflation accelerated right at the beginning of the quarter in meat and stuff, seafood, dairy, I think you guys said you managed it pretty well. What\u2019s your sense of what happened at the restaurant level with customers and passing it through? It looks like the macro numbers you gave for the industry suggested there\u2019s a little strengthening in the industry. So getting at this inflation seems like it\u2019s going to be here for a while at an elevated level in some of these key categories and what\u2019s your guys\u2019 sense of how long it\u2019s going to take to pass it through?", "Bill DeLaney", "Yeah, let me be clear \u2013 I\u2019m not clear on how long it\u2019s going to be here but certainly it\u2019s been with us for five or six months now. And I think from what I\u2019ve been reading which is I\u2019m sure the same material you read in those categories, customers are\u2026 Obviously they have to pass them along at some point. These are double-digit increases. So I think they are selectively passing it along where they feel that they can support it in their business; I\u2019m sure they\u2019re also working their menus. ", "Poultry is a category that at least to date has not experienced much inflation so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re seeing more poultry offerings and that type of thing. So I think they\u2019re managing the portions, I think they\u2019re managing the mix of the menu and they\u2019re passing it along where they can. That\u2019s been my experience in terms of going out to eat. ", "As we\u2019ve said, medium- to long-term the data we\u2019ve seen over the years is about what gets passed along from the restaurant to the consumer is about 2% year in and year out, so that\u2019ll oscillate a little bit but probably not a lot. So there may be a little bit more being passed along right now but I don\u2019t think a lot. And I think the other thing that validates that is when you look at some of the other numbers from the summer that you know, we\u2019re seeing year-over-year sales growth at the restaurant level but we\u2019re seeing flat to down traffic, so I think that would validate that as well.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Gotcha. And moving on to the, I think this was the first quarter in a while where your MA served business is up at broad line \u2013 it\u2019s up marginally but it\u2019s up. What should we look at? You referenced just lapping when it was down but I\u2019m trying to tie it into some of the investment it sounds like you\u2019ve made internally into sales management, whether it\u2019s the sales (inaudible) you called out or the regional management and coordination. Can you just give a little color on that?", "Bill DeLaney", "Yeah, I think what I was trying to articulate was not so much lapping as just a fair amount of the stress that we\u2019ve put on the organization in particular in the sales arena, and that we\u2019ve lapped a lot of that. So yeah, I think things are more stable out there today than they were 12 or 18 months ago in terms of people just going to work every morning. They know what their role is, they know what their territory is, they know what their commission plan is, they know how cat man works, they\u2019ve got better tools for that and we\u2019re giving them some other tools to work with in other areas like revenue management. ", "So I think from that standpoint we\u2019ve made a lot of investments and we\u2019re at a point now where we\u2019re managing that better. So I\u2019m pretty optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to see a good improvement. To your point, it\u2019s modest but you know, everything in this industry right now is modest. As long as it\u2019s positive you know, we\u2019re going to be very pleased.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Yeah. And just a last thing on, it seems like a pretty good environment for business that\u2019s generating a lot of savings on the cost side, on the cost of goods sold side with all the inflation out there to go after share, maybe really invest that more into the customers than previously planned in sort of a more flat inflation environment. What is your business\u2019 appetite for that kind of strategic sense in the next little while?", "Bill DeLaney", "I think we\u2019ve been able to grow our share consistently year in and year out, so that\u2019s what we do. We think that\u2019s very important but to do it the right way. So our way of going after share is really to become more efficient in everything that we do, to take costs out of our system. It\u2019s one of the big opportunities. We see this merger as very pro-customer, pro-competition; it allows us to take costs out, that kind of thing. ", "So the way you grow your share ultimately is to take costs out of the system, develop your people, hire better people where you need to and compete as well as you can in terms of the acute pressures in the marketplace, but to also differentiate yourself over the medium- and long-term as well with your products, your services, your business solutions. So we\u2019re always looking to grow but we need to grow profitably both in the short-term and the medium-term.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Erin Lash with Morningstar. ", "Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar ", "Thank you for taking the question. Obviously US Foods is getting a lot of the attention but I was just wondering if you could talk about the overall I guess acquisition environment and kind of your appetite for future deals, as well as just kind of the premiums that sellers are potentially looking for in this type of environment.", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, Erin, I\u2019ll take that one. We continue to look at transactions. We\u2019re obviously fairly occupied right now with planning for the merger integration so we don\u2019t have as many resources probably looking at transactions as we would in other quarters, other years. We also, it\u2019s going to be a little difficult to do deals in the US for a little bit of time at least while we get this one approved but we continue to look in our other markets and we continue to look in new markets, and we\u2019re fairly prudent especially if it\u2019s a new market. So they\u2019ll come a little slower. But I\u2019d say we\u2019re still pretty active and still looking for opportunities in other parts of our geographies and new geographies.", "The second part of your question in terms of expectations, I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019ve really seen a marked change in expectations in terms of pricing from call it a year ago. I think there was a time when we talked about it on these calls, where expectations were pretty high given where the macroeconomics were. I think those moderated some. We\u2019ve been able to get a lot of deals done and I think they\u2019ve held in that kind of reasonable range since then.", "Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar ", "Thank you, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just one other question: obviously I get the sense with the US Foods integration that there isn\u2019t a target I guess this year for the ERP rollout. Is that true or are there maybe a certain number of operating companies that you are looking to complete by the end of the fiscal year?", "Bill DeLaney", "There\u2019s not a specific target, Erin, you\u2019re right. What we want to do is get the merger closed and then get the integration connected to that, and then we\u2019ll put together a rollout schedule that would incorporate both platforms if you will.", "Erin Lash \u2013 Morningstar ", "Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.", "Amod Gautam \u2013 J.P. Morgan ", "Hi, it\u2019s actually Amod Gautam. In terms of the acquisition question maybe a little bit more specifically, in your F2015 planning are you budgeting any cash flow for acquisitions? Or I guess asked another way, is the 4% to 6% sales growth, does that include some contribution from acquisition obviously ex the US Foods?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, we actually plan those differently. So what we typically do is we look at a long-term expectation for sales growth. We\u2019ve said 4% to 6% for a while. We build that up from the standpoint of what do we think real cases are going to grow in the industry, how much more do we think we will grow because we\u2019re typically pretty good at growing faster than the industry; what\u2019s the rate of inflation that should go on top of that; and then does that fall within the 4% to 6% range, yes or no? We still feel good about 4% to 6%, that\u2019s how we build that up.", "Some of those cases may indeed come from acquisitions when we think about how much more than the industry we can grow so that\u2019s how it gets baked in there. Separately we typically task ourselves with a certain percentage of growth through acquisitions, what we\u2019ll call kind of the smaller, non-US-Food-type-size acquisitions. We\u2019ve traditionally said that we want to grow at least 1% from those types of acquisitions. We haven\u2019t put that guidance out there for next year again because of the pending merger here but we certainly challenge ourselves to hit some internal targets along those lines as well.", "Amod Gautam \u2013 J.P. Morgan ", "Okay, and then on the gross margins I guess, Bill, you alluded a little bit to the mix shift being somewhat tactical on the locally managed versus the corporate business. I mean as you think about F2015 gross margin percent has kind of come down over the past few years but it does seem like you have some potential tailwinds here, whether it be that mix shift or inflation coming off or some of the category management initiatives. So just broadly on F2015, is this a year where maybe gross margin percentage can stabilize after several years of decline.", "Bill DeLaney", "Well, I think you\u2019ve got to start with improving over F2014, so that\u2019s our goal. And as Chris pointed out in his comments we saw that improvement kick in the second half of the year. So we saw 4% here in this quarter so that\u2019s encouraging. There\u2019s some inflation in that like we\u2019ve acknowledged, so I think if we can just show good, steady improvement throughout the year and manage our expenses appropriately we\u2019ll have a successful year. ", "And as we continue to drive up these initiatives, and these are not just one-time initiatives. These are different ways of doing business. Category management is a different way of selling and marketing and merchandising. Revenue management is a different way of segmenting your customers and trying to approach your customers with the best offerings that we can with the right presentation with the right channel, those types of things.", "So I would just say to you we\u2019re in the early days of transforming this company in terms of how we need to compete and how we need to support our customers for them to be successful. And that will undergird all of this in terms of our ability to price effectively and manage our costs along the way.", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, I\u2019ll just add a little more to that. I mean I\u2019ll pick up on Bill\u2019s comment of early days. We\u2019ve said before that we\u2019ve got two of the waves, the majority of two waves kind of fully into the market at this point of our category management initiatives and we\u2019ve got a lot more waves to come. Now those two that are out there were a lot of dollars but we\u2019ve got a lot more waves to come. And the point of that being that we still have a lot to roll out. ", "We still have the opportunity to do better and better and we just have to keep working at it. It required some patience on our part to build the teams, build the processes, get it started. We believe we\u2019re starting to see some of those results in the numbers now and we\u2019re hopeful those numbers continue to shine in the numbers every quarter. And that as we\u2019re saying we believe mitigates whatever competitive pressure is out there.", "Amod Gautam \u2013 J.P. Morgan ", "Okay, great.

At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer Bill DeLaney.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you, Shannon. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported first quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales grew more than 6% to $12.4 billion and adjusted net earnings increased 7.6% to $309 million.", "Adjusted EPS, excluding certain items, increased approximately 6% to $0.52 for the quarter, our strongest year-over-year growth in quite sometime. We are pleased with the solid operating performance we delivered in our first fiscal quarter in the midst of ongoing challenging market conditions. ", "While we were challenged with expense management in certain aspects of our business, we generated more than 2% case volume growth and managed acute inflationary pressures very effectively, as evidenced by essentially flat year-over-year gross margin. ", "Our improved performance during the quarter was due in part to the benefits we realized from our portfolio of business transformation initiatives, especially category management. In addition, case growth trends in our locally managed business were favorable for the second consecutive quarter. ", "Recent restaurant data reflects ongoing stagnant traffic trends but somewhat improved industry sales trends as food-service establishments increase prices to offset high inflation in meat, dairy and seafood categories. However while we believe that industry trends have gradually improved, that improvement has been more pronounced in certain geographic regions. In addition, while consumer confidence and employment metrics have strengthened somewhat, overall consumer spending remains restrained. ", "Lastly we\u2019re hopeful that the recent marked declines in fuel prices will help to drive additional traffic to our customers.", "With that, we remained intently focused on enhancing every aspect of our business so that we were able to better support our customers, operate more efficiently and compete more effectively. As I mentioned, benefits from our category management initiatives continued to gain momentum. We expect that all remaining categories we\u2019ll launch into the market by the end of this fiscal year and that we will achieve our financial savings target. ", "Turning to an update on our technology initiatives, during the quarter we successfully executed a major software upgrade for the 12 operating companies using SAP. In addition, while we will talk more about the proposed merger in a moment, we continue our merger integration planning and sequencing work with regard to technology. We expect initial post-merger areas of focus will include the rollout of SAP financial modules for general ledger, accounts payable and accounts receivable as well as additional elements of the HR module, all of which will make future SAP conversions at the operating companies relatively easier. ", "While we're pleased with our accomplishments during the quarter, we did fall short of our expense management goals. Expense increases were broad-based and were primarily driven by increases in sales, delivery and incentive accruals. ", "On the sales side, we\u2019ve begun to hire MAs in targeted markets and expect these investments to contribute to sales growth over time. In the delivery area, driver turnover and shortages continue to drive higher wages and overtime expense. However our single largest opportunity for improvement was a more consistent execution across the organization. We are developing and implementing tools that will provide increased visibility to keep performance metrics as well as improved best business practices. We believe these enhancements combined with our new functional structure will lead to improved customer service, greater operational efficiency, enhanced cost management and increased profitability. ", "As we noted on last quarter's earnings call, we also are investing in some promising new sales programs and market-driven initiatives. We have developed several initiatives targeted at improving our customers\u2019 experience. For example, our initiative to grow our share in the underpenetrated Manhattan market has been very successful. In addition, we\u2019ve developed a robust approach to serving the fast-growing Hispanic restaurant segment focused on providing authentic products utilizing a dedicated sales team.", "Also, our commitment to solicit and listen to feedback from our customers carried out under our customer first program has led to several important enhancements, including developing new technology that will ultimately allow our customer to track their delivery and enhanced customer onboarding program aimed at increasing customer retention and improved sharing of best practices in our business review program. ", "With regard to our proposed merger with US Foods, we've been in productive discussions with FTC staff on a solution to permit the FTC to conclude its review. Given the amount of work remaining and considering the upcoming holidays we do not currently expect to complete the transaction before the first quarter of 2015. ", "Our integration planning work is progressing well and we successfully completed a $5 billion debt offering just following the end of the quarter as we prepared to fund the nonequity components of the transaction. Chris will provide more detail about this in a few moments. ", "In closing, we are pleased with our topline and gross profit performance for the quarter and believe that our investment in business transformation initiatives contributed to this achievement. I would like to thank our 52,000 associates for their dedication and hard work that drove our favorable first quarter results. As we move forward into the remainder of our fiscal year, we're committed to improving the consistency of our operational execution, successfully rolling out our portfolio of initiatives and further developing our plans to integrate Sysco and US Foods. This truly is an exciting time in our history and we believe the actions we are taking are strategically the right priorities to both achieve our vision and enhance profitability over the long-term. ", "Now I will turn things over to Chris so he can provide additional details on our financial results for the quarter.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thanks, Bill and good morning everyone. For the first quarter, sales were $12.4 billion or an increase of 6.2% compared to the prior year. ", "Food cost inflation was 4.9% driven mainly by inflation in the meat, dairy and seafood categories. Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.6%. However this was largely offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates which decreased sales by 0.5%. ", "Case volume grew 2.3% during the quarter, including acquisitions and approximately 2.2%, excluding acquisition. Gross profit in the first quarter increased 6%, nearly at the same rate as sales growth. Gross margin declined 4 basis points to 17.59%, reflecting the positive impact from our category management initiative and improved margin trends over the last few quarters. ", "Operating expenses increased $136 million or 8.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year period. Operating expenses increased mainly due to a $67 million increase in payroll expense and a $41 million increase in certain item expenses. The most significant drivers in the increase in payroll expense were higher sales and delivery costs as well as incentive accruals. ", "Regarding the incentive accruals, during the last year's first quarter we reduced certain incentive accruals based on our performance at that time. In this year\u2019s first quarter, our incentives are generally accrued to higher amounts, reflecting the impact of recent performance and causing a year-over-year variance. ", "Certain items totaled $43 million during the quarter and mainly related to the merger and integration expenses. The substantial majority of these costs related to consulting fees. Excluding certain items, operating expenses increased 6%. ", "As Bill mentioned, we believe we had opportunities to better manage our operating expenses over the balance of the year. However the cost increases in the first quarter will pressure our ability to meet our goal of achieving flat cost per case for the year. ", "Operating income for the quarter was down 2.6% year-over-year. After adjusting for certain items, operating income increased 5.9%. Net earnings for the quarter were $279 million, a decrease of $7 million or 2.4% compared to the prior year. ", "*", "Diluted EPS was $0.47, a 2.1% decrease compared to the prior year. Adjusting for certain items, net earnings increased 7.6% to $309 million and diluted EPS increased 6.1% to $0.52. ", "Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, totaled $190 million for the first quarter this year compared to $125 million last year. Cash flow from operations was $63 million for the quarter as the first quarter is typically a lighter cash flow quarter for us due to seasonal changes in our business. This result was $107 million lower than last year's first quarter which is the result of three major drivers. ", "First, the cash impact of certain items increased $40 million year-over-year. Second, we made a $50 million pension contribution in the first quarter this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contribution each year. And lastly, working capital usage increased year-over-year mainly due to an increase in sales and inventory driven in large part by inflation. As a result of these year-over-year changes, free cash flow was negative $55 million for the first quarter. ", "Turning to the pending US Foods merger, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we issued $5 billion in debt and six series over various periods from 3 to 30 years with an average weighted coupon rate of 3.4%. We decided to go to market prior to closing the transaction in order to be ready to fund the transaction as soon as we were able to do so. The proceeds of the offering are intended to fund the various elements of the US Foods transaction. ", "In addition, as we closed on the new debt issuance, we simultaneously terminated both the bridge facility and the pre-issuance hedges. As a reminder, after we announced the proposed merger we put in place a $2 billion interest rate hedge as part of our risk management strategy against the portion of the anticipated bond issuance. ", "Following the unwinding of the hedges we paid $59 million in September 2014 to settle the hedge against our 10-year note issuance which you will note is shown as a financing activity in our cash flow statement in the first fiscal quarter. ", "In addition, we paid $130 million in early October to settle the hedge against our 30 year debt issuance, which will be shown as a financing activity in our cash flow statement in the second fiscal quarter. The financial impact of the unwind of the hedges will be amortized into earnings over 10 years and 30 years respectively. ", "Regarding our outlook into the second quarter and the remainder of the year, there are several items I\u2019d like to point out. First, with regard to our category management initiative over the balance of the year, we expect the year-over-year impact of these benefits in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year to be relatively similar before moderating in the fourth quarter. ", "Second, as we disclosed on last quarter's call, we continue to expect that corporate expenses will increase compared to the prior fiscal year. Due to the timing of these expenses quarter to quarter we expect a more significant year-over-year impact in the second quarter. ", "Third, we will recognize a $13 million write-off in the second quarter of unamortized debt costs related to the termination of the bridge facility which occurred as we issued the new debt related to the transaction. This write-off will be recorded in interest expense and will be treated as a certain item when we report our results next quarter. ", "Fourth, as a result of the issuance of the new debt and the unwind of the pre-issuance hedges, we will recognize approximately $14 million in additional interest expense per month beginning in the second quarter. This expense will also be treated as a certain item when we report our results until the merger closes. ", "And finally, last year in the second quarter, our tax rate was unusually low mainly due to the favorable resolution of certain matters. This will create a year-over-year timing difference from a tax rate perspective in the second quarter. ", "In closing, while the business environment in the food-service industry remains challenging, we were encouraged by the progress we've made implementing our business transformation initiatives and believe we\u2019ve many opportunities ahead to continue to enhance our customers\u2019 experience, strengthening our operating performance and increase profitability. ", "With that operator, we will now take questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.", "Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets ", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just first, on the payroll increase, I'm wondering if you could just go into a little bit more details in terms of the different buckets of the $67 million increase between the sales, the delivery expense, and the incentive accruals? And what sort of year-over-year increase in payroll was that overall for the first quarter? You mentioned it would be kind of difficult to achieve that flat cost per case for the year, so how should we think about payroll for the next couple of quarters? ", "Bill DeLaney", "I will start Kelly and let Chris kind of help me out here little bit. I would say just on the overall expenses \u2013 before I answer the question I guess is your expenses as adjusted are up about 6% and in payroll labor and related is usually 70 - generally 70%, 75% of our structure. So I don't have the exact number in terms of payroll. I don\u2019t know that we disclosed that but I think that should be a pretty good proxy for you looking at there. It comes in different buckets as we took you through on the sales side. For example, and we have begun to grow our MA workforce again modestly, we\u2019re more in certain markets. So we made some significant reductions in territories \u2013 unprofitable territories 18 to 24 months ago. So we\u2019ve worked our way through that. We\u2019ve grown our territories. ", "We had a very nice quarter. We grew our gross profit quite a bit. We grew our locally managed business. The way our commission grids and our bonus grids work, that does translate to a more earnings for our salespeople and for our management team. So that\u2019s probably what you see there. I think the other biggest bucket was in delivery -- especially in certain markets we\u2019re struggling to attract people. It\u2019s a great markets if you\u2019re a driver these days and to retain drivers in certain markets as well. So I\u2019d say most of the payroll impact was in those two areas. ", "Chris Kreidler", "I don't have a lot to add \u2013 just my comments about the incentive accruals are simply that the last year we lowered a longer-term incentive accrual based upon where we are versus those targets in that particular incentive and that this year we are at target. So you\u2019ve got the year over lapping effect there. So that was a portion of it as well. ", "Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets ", "Great, that's very helpful. And then I was wondering if I could just follow-up with one kind of bigger picture question. Could you talk about just the trends you're seeing maybe with respect to categories and the types of foods that are seeing strongest growth? The reason I ask is I guess we heard from McDonald's, maybe a week or two ago, that they were thinking about possibly pursuing some organics. I'm just curious with what you're seeing in trends in natural and organics and if your customer base were to increase focus on those types of products, where do you think you and your suppliers stand in terms of being able to cater to that? ", "Bill DeLaney", "I think we have seen those trends for quite sometime whether it\u2019s organic or local or sustainable, different people look at different ways. So local is probably the bigger trend that I think we tend to see given that we do have some of the locally managed customers who are cozing that type of thing. And so I would say it's the trend that\u2019s growing. I wouldn't describe it as an overly large piece of our business today but I think it's an increasingly important for two reasons. One, it is growing and I think we want to be ahead of that, or at least step with that. And I think two, with the customers where those types of products are important -- even though it might be a relatively small piece of their buy, they feel very strongly about that. So whether it's organic or local or other similar types of items or categories, that being able to supply those types of products is key to continue to develop the relationship with those types of customers. ", "And I think our suppliers are getting there. It\u2019s \u2013 I think as we work through category management, especially the second round once we've been through these initial launches, I think this type of a discussion will be even more bigger part of the discussion as we go forward. So certainly suppliers are very proactive in this space and others we work with together to further our offerings as we go forward. So I think it's a trend that\u2019s been there, it\u2019s growing. The people that want local and organic are very very steadfast in those desires and it\u2019s an important part of those customer relationships. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "On the sequential improvement in the MA-served sales growth, could you help us think about where that's coming from? It sounds like, obviously, there's an inflation help and I guess there's more salespeople. Could you give us a little more color on how or what's driving that internally or externally, maybe it's the environment? ", "Bill DeLaney", "I think it is \u2013 I honestly don\u2019t think the environment has changed that much. We went through kind of this weather cycle last year where it was really rough, December through February, and so that certainly impacted everyone. And then cabin effect in April and May where sales came back pretty strongly. We\u2019ve lapped a lot of that now. So I think the market is kind of where it\u2019s been. I think it's almost month-to-month, you see one report \u2013 one month where consumer confidence is up, or the restaurant operators\u2019 confidence is up, the next month it\u2019s down a little bit. So I don\u2019t think there is any a distinct change in the pattern there. ", "I think from our perspective we\u2019re a year or two years now into these initiatives, both in terms of the category management but also some of the segmenting work we've been doing with our sales and marketing teams and we have a program called back to basics that we are out there with \u2013 and it allows us to both focus more in certain segments and at the same time use that as an opportunity to enhance training with our sales force. So we\u2019ve seen some positive trends there. As I noted in my comments some of this is more geographic specific. And so I think at least from what we see certainly the South in particular where we are here in Southwest has been strong for a while now. And so in the West, it looks like we\u2019re seeing some improved results there and I don\u2019t know how much that as a macro. We had a foldout out in Southern California last year, we\u2019re through that and we\u2019re starting to see the rewards from that investment that we made at Riverside last year. ", "And I would say the last thing I guess from my perspective is just the stability of where we are in our initiatives. We\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019re two plus years into all these initiatives, that first year, year and a half it was very significant impact on our sales force. As I said earlier we reduced a lot of unprofitable territories, that has an impact. It took us a while to kind of hit our stride in category management. So as we\u2019ve matured in rolling out these initiatives I think it's become more business as usual and we\u2019re just executing better. So I think little bit maybe on the macro, little uneven, little geographic there and I just think that a lot of this change that we\u2019re driving out we\u2019re getting better at it and more stability within the sales force. ", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Can you just as a follow-up before I get back in queue, could you annualize what the growth in the MA looks like, even if it's not maybe contributing a lot like right now? ", "Bill DeLaney", "Andy, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something we've done before. I\u2019d just tell you that we are growing in a number of MAs and it is modest. I think let me comment at this way. The way we are evolving, I think in terms of our thoughts on MAs and salespeople and territories in particular is to grow those territories at a level that we anticipate opportunities for sales growth and to try to stay ahead of that. So some markets might be mid-single digits, and other markets, might be flat to low single digits. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. ", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities", "So Bill, on gross margin, where do you guys sit now with price investments? Are we at a point, even when the category management benefit subsides, are we finally at a point where gross margin can be managed flat year-over-year and [indiscernible] the downward pressure that you've had in the past? ", "Bill DeLaney", "The honest short answer is I don't know, certainly that\u2019s our goal and the way we have spoken to it is we expect because of -- the ongoing nature of the market that we\u2019re in, it\u2019s a large market that's the good news, it\u2019s low barriers to entry, there\u2019s a lot of people in it. And there is not a lot of growth there right now. So I think we\u2019re continuing to see a lot of pressure on the street and what you hear us saying, what you hear d me saying in particular for example on the caveman is that those initiatives are beginning to bear fruit and helping us to offset some of the pricing pressures that you're alluding to. And I think when you look at our quarter obviously we had a lot of inflation in certain categories and I think we did a decent job of passing that along in an appropriate way. But I would say most of the margin positives in the quarter were from taking cost out of our cost of goods and in ensuring those savings with our customers.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities", "Do you think -- is that level of price competition, has that been exacerbated right by the whole merger situation in that people may see some business up for grabs while you guys are in limbo or no? ", "Bill DeLaney", "I think in certain markets I would say that that's probably had more of an impact on US Foods than it has on us. I think they are in a tougher situation there to deal with that. So yeah, there\u2019s definitely, I am sure, some competitors trying to take advantage of that. But I think it's also -- I think early months or weeks that was a bigger deal, I think that\u2019s levelled out to some extent. I don't think it\u2019s been an impact in our people. We\u2019ve kept our people very focused and it\u2019s not to say there is not incidence of that, I am not saying that but in general on a base of whatever 12 billion in sales for the quarter I don't think that was the big part of it. At least not for us.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities", "And then just lastly, back on the growth in MAs, was a lot of that, did that pre-date or the plan for that pre-date US Foods and is most of that in non-overlapping markets or it's both? ", "Bill DeLaney", "It has nothing to do with US Foods. I mean it was basically in our profit plan for the year. Look, I have spoken to some previous calls, we took approximately thousand unprofitable territories out of our business over what we thought was going to be a 12 month period, it happened in 3 to 6 so that was pretty significant impact and most of our operating companies and markets did a nice job managing that. In certain instances, we didn't do so good job and we went too fast and that had some doubling down negative impact. So that's really us -- a management team whatever 6, 12 months ago saying okay, we\u2019ve done that now, let\u2019s get back to what we normally do which is growing territories in conjunction with what we think the opportunities are. So I wouldn\u2019t try to connect that to US Foods at all.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Lauren Wood - Credit Suisse", "It's Lauren Wood on for Ed. Just another question on gross profit. So it looks like the spread between gross profit growth and volume growth improved again this quarter. Can you maybe talk about how much of that could be attributed to internal initiatives like category management, how much of that could be attributed to inflation, and how sustainable do you think this is going forward? ", "Bill DeLaney", "Well, okay, I think when you look at the growth in gross profit dollars, we've acknowledged that there is a lot of inflation in that and so that is part of the \u2013 that 6% growth we\u2019re talking about in sales and GP dollars inflation, piece of that. However inflation also makes it more difficult to keep that spread relatively close. So that\u2019s where I was saying I felt even though the market continues to be very competitive that we did a nice job there and that takes you to the initiatives of which we think category management in particular has now kicked in, in a meaningful way, allowing us to manage our cost of goods more effectively and also to invest in our customers along the way. So I think it's mostly the initiatives as well as the fact that we\u2019ve got 7000 salespeople out there, 70 operating companies and senior management teams and they\u2019re all very focused on executing as well as they can. So I think with at least us growing into a company that\u2019s going to continue to embrace change and have initiatives, I think our people are coming to grips with that, we\u2019re getting better at executing change in the business at the same time. But I think the initiatives themselves as I said earlier are contributing to that. And I think on the inflation front, we just did a nice job there of keeping that spread as close as we did.", "Lauren Wood - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and just as a follow-up, can you give us any more color on maybe what categories you've addressed more recently and how that process is going? ", "Bill DeLaney", "Well I tell you, we\u2019re into waves 6, 7, 8 \u2013 we\u2019re well into it now. So I don't have all the categories in front of me. I know I think we have done some poultry categories and I know bread and rolls were big one but we\u2019re now into categories where there is double-digit subcategories f you will. So we\u2019re into the core of the entire offering right now.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.", "Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Just a couple of questions on the integration costs. So you're now kind of at $130 million cumulatively and I guess the first question is, are we now kind of at the point where this is about as far as you can go without actually merging? And then the second question was is this included in the original $700 million to $800 million in guidance that you gave on integration expenses or is that in addition to? ", "Chris Kreidler", "Hi Karen, let me start with the second part of the question. We certainly included in our original guidance 700 million, $800 million some assumption for pre-closing merger integrated expenses. I think it\u2019s fair to say we had exceeded that assumption. We will come out with a new number of what we think the overall costs are going to be. We will share that as well, as what we\u2019ve spent which we\u2019ve been disclosing on a month by month basis. But obviously we\u2019ve spent more than we originally planned. ", "The first part of your question -- there is continual work that we can do. There's only a certain amount of information we can share between the two companies prior to actually closing the transaction. And so we do as much as we can kind of business stream by business stream and then we do some work in clean rooms but there is some work that we can\u2019t even do outside our clean room or inside of clean room I should say until we actually close. So there\u2019s more work to be done. I think it\u2019s fair to say at this point we\u2019ve done a lot of good work. Teams have put in a tremendous amount of effort. We\u2019ve got a very clear idea about how we would merge the two companies together and the more time we have the more butt left would say our integration execution will be once we\u2019re able to start that process. So there's still more work to be done perhaps not at the same level and same intensity as we\u2019ve been doing it over the last 10 months. ", "Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess just to follow on that, I guess within the bucket of this $130 million, can you maybe give a sense of what the dollar amount that would be Sysco employees that have fully dedicated to the integration planning versus the actual just pure consulting fees? ", "Chris Kreidler", "Yes, the vast majority of it is consulting fees, Karen.", "Karen Short \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And then just last question was on the update of the business transformation to other OpCo's this coming year, any idea what the plans are? ", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, I'll start here, Bill may want to chime in. As we said in prior last couple of calls, we just did a major upgrade at the SAP software itself which went well and now we\u2019re focused on doing what we will call some functional rollout of SAP. So Bill mentioned in his opening remarks accounts payable, accounts receivable, we will do some I think additional rollout of some HR functionality etc. and that has a double advantage. One, it helps our shared services. That secondly, it also helps us as we begin to do merger integration, once we\u2019re allowed to do that, it helps us achieve synergies faster. So that\u2019s the focus that we have for our SAP rollout now. ", "Those types of things, once we do them actually make rollouts in the operating companies easier because we\u2019re converting \u2013 we\u2019re transitioning less at these operating companies when we actually go back to rolling out at operating companies. And as we go through this process we are obviously looking at the overall integration plan from a technology perspective of how we will roll out operating companies in the merged enterprise. ", "Bill DeLaney", "I think the only thing I would add there is \u2013 in the broader way of looking at business transformation we\u2019ve talked about category management. This is going to be a good year to continue to launch the rest of the categories this year. We\u2019re pretty much through the SG&A work and so you\u2019re not seeing a lot of new benefits coming from that, that was the work that I alluded to earlier that we did the first year and year and a half. There is a lot of work still going on on the operations side, supply chain side of business in terms of optimizing our efficiencies, our processes or our pay plans in the warehouse and delivery and we\u2019re really not seeing those benefits to the degree that we will down the road. ", "So again in the broader way of looking at business transformation there\u2019s still a lot going on, that our operating companies are dealing with right now.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays. ", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I wanted to talk a little bit more about category management. I think you've spoken in the past that it wasn't just a simple SKU rationalization process, but it's clearly having a very nice benefit on the gross margin. Can you talk a little bit about exactly what's happening and how that's leading to the gross margin improvement? ", "Bill DeLaney", "Sure. I think the key, Meredith from our perspective is we have a very robust process that we\u2019ve developed. We have brought a lot of people into the organization at all different levels who have done category management for and other industries. And so we\u2019ve learned from some of our other stumbles if you will, with initiatives that we needed to not just develop the folks we have of which we've done, but also bring in some other folks that have the experience. I think we\u2019ve had really strong leadership with Tom Bene and Bill Day and Bill\u2019s group. So I think it starts there and we feel good about that. ", "The nature of the process is sitting down with these suppliers and trying to create some level of partnership as we go forward, obviously it\u2019s not going to be the same with every supplier and the focus on the customer and focus on the opportunity for growth. And as you do that at least two things become quite apparent is by using some of the intelligence that our suppliers have, all the time developing more insights ourselves through our customer work and marketing, we\u2019re able to see where most of our customers want to spend their money in terms of what items, what categories and we\u2019re able to also focus -- necessarily focused on where we have a lot of redundancy in SKUs and items that don\u2019t move a lot. And then as we work closer together with the suppliers and we start to see success which is the key, we\u2019re able to see that working together here we can create savings for the customers and for our supplier and for ourselves and that creates this efficiencies that you\u2019re starting to see on the cost of goods side.", "So it clearly starts with technology and this is a big change in our company, strengthening our team, it\u2019s coming at this from a customer perspective and ultimately getting the right suppliers to partner up with us in a way that it\u2019s a win-win, win, it\u2019s got to work for the customer, it needs to work for us and obviously it\u2019s got to work for supplier.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And how do you deal with pushback from a customer who says, oh, I'm madly in love with my particular vendor, don't do anything? Do you just keep that item around or are there financial incentives for them to shift vendors? ", "Bill DeLaney", "Well I think we\u2019ve gotten better at that, and I think it comes with understanding our customers and listening to them and getting them to actually have that conversation with us. And so from that standpoint I think we\u2019ve made good strides. It\u2019s all the above. I think for the most part you have the conversation, you understand what the x says, as best as you can, and you make it more about choices and/or timeline. So in certain cases depending on the customer and how key an item is, you may not convert them. But in most instances, there is an opportunity to convert them, certainly you will need to share some of the economics with them as well and you will need to \u2013 again I think it\u2019s where we\u2019ve gotten better -- you need to have a timeline that works for the customer. And again we\u2019re not looking to \u2013 and we\u2019d be nice to do all these and 90 to 180 days but if it takes six months to a year to do it the right way, that's what we\u2019re doing. ", "So again it just comes down to listening to that customer and getting them -- really trying to understand what -- why they have that angst and maybe what you say, maybe as simple as some type of economic play, but it very well could be they are happy to make the changes we just need to sell on it, and that takes some time to get them to understand the attributes of the alternative product.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then I have a question for Chris. You did mention that cost per case this year might not be down the way you'd hoped it would be or it might not be flat as you'd hoped it would be. Is it the things you talked about in the first quarter, specifically transportation, but MAs and incentive comp that are the reason you don't think you'll make the cost per case goal or is there something else that you're thinking about? ", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, it\u2019s more than that but it\u2019s something we didn\u2019t talk about \u2013 I think Bill\u2019s prepared comments I think he described that as pretty broad-based and so we had some increases almost across the board in different areas, some of which we expected, certain pension related costs and things like that, and some of which we didn\u2019t, so delivery expenses continue to be upbeat and they were up pretty significantly last year. We talked about the sales compensation expense, things like that. So as we look here at the end of Q1 what we\u2019re really calling out is our cost per case is up significantly. We had a flat goal for the year. We have a lot of areas to go after and we will go after those but we\u2019re pointing out that there\u2019s going to be some pressure on us achieving that goal. ", "In no way are we going to give up on the goal but we are calling out the fact that it\u2019s going to be harder because we are starting if you will on the trench, we\u2019ve got to dig our way out it.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies", "Hi, thank you. Could you talk a little more about -- you said that certain geographies were performing better than others. Is that a function of what's going on with the consumer health in those markets or is it more Sysco initiatives that are driving that? ", "Bill DeLaney", "Well I would say what we are extrapolating \u2013 at least what I'm extrapolating is when we see some deltas that are somewhat pronounced, you would have to -- one would conclude that some of that is coming from the relative health of the local or regional economy. so when I talk about the Southwest, I think the economy that has been strong dynamic for long time now, we\u2019ve got some very large operating companies in southwest that have been performing very well for multiple years as well. So it's a combination but certainly when you look at the South and the West compared to what we see up in the North and the Northeast to some extent, there are differences. So we\u2019ve got strong people throughout the country and leaders and associates and I think the initiatives are being developed and implemented pretty evenly throughout the country. So I think on the margin it\u2019s more of the economy as well as the execution. ", "The good news is we\u2019re having success in all of our markets right now. I was just trying to bring some color to everything that you read and we tend to - questions we tend to get on these calls as \u2013 is it as competitive \u2013 is it more competitive and we think it's just as competitive as it\u2019s been quite some time. We just happen to believe that there is two or three markets that are a little bit more favorable I guess in terms of underlying economics and consumer outlook. ", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Jefferies", "Lastly, in talking about the US Foods merger and the FTC review, you did use the word solution, which implies you're working on addressing a concern. If there's any other color you can give us there or are you considering divestitures or was that always part of the plan? ", "Bill DeLaney", "Well I think you have to go back to where we were. So I would just say this \u2013 we are at a point now where we\u2019re certainly talking to the right people. We\u2019re having the right conversations and it's taking longer than what we originally projected. With that said we really had never been through anything like this before. So it's really hard to get to toward \u2013 too concerned about that aspect of it. I will go back to the comments I made when we announced the deal back in December 9. We think the strategic value of this opportunity is significant. We think it's very pro-competitive. We think it\u2019s going to be very good for our customers over time. We certainly think there is complexity to it and we need to get a good return on it. And as we said on previous called since then we have shared a lot of information with the FTC, we've had a lot of meetings with the FTC and I think they are up to speed now in this industry, it\u2019s taken some sometime, it's an industry where as you know there's not a lot of other public players, really other than us currently, so it\u2019s just taking more time and we thought to I think give the information to the FTC, get it digested and begin to having these conversations. ", "So bottom line, we\u2019re looking for a successful outlook. We are looking for a solution .We just think at this point it\u2019s going to take longer than we originally projected. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald", "I had a variation of some of the questions asked earlier on how you're managing your gross margin so well with this level of inflation. I think if your cost of goods is going up and you're passing along the higher food costs, the gross margin percentage should still decrease, even with higher gross profit dollars, at least that's the way the math is supposed to work. So can you comment if you're getting any unusual support from the vendor community that's helping you out? Is there anything else that might be driving the gross margin trends, such as incremental vendor support, that's on top of the cost savings initiatives that you talked about earlier? ", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah, Ajay, I think as we discussed on the last two or three calls I would agree with your first point that when you have significant inflation especially in the categories we called out here, you\u2019re looking at double-digit inflation for at least the last couple quarters, meat, seafood and dairy. You generally cannot pass that along as fast as you\u2019d like and frankly in many instances it's not even appropriate to do that. So I will go back to something we\u2019ve been doing for years and we work with our customers, we work with them on their menus, we look at alternative products that would make their offerings in their item selection and their menus more attractive. And we do that through our product specialists or company chefs and obviously through our marketing associates and our counter executives. So we do all those things. ", "So it is harder to pass it along and that's why I was referring to earlier I think it remains very competitive from a pricing standpoint on the street. There's nothing special going on with vendor support. What I was speaking to a couple other times, is when we say that we believe the category management is beginning to deliver the results that we projected for it, that does play out on the cost of goods side. When you are able to form some strategic partners with your suppliers and as you get deeper into the category launches and you begin to execute those throughout the enterprise, it takes months to really cycle through all that but that does translate into savings and that I think that's what you're seeing is where we are buying better but nothing other than the fact that the process for category management is beginning to mature.", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald", "Okay, thank you. And I don't expect you to respond further to potential FTC issues, but I wanted to see if you can comment on one practical aspect of any divestitures you might need to make. So specifically, for some of the national accounts that are currently handled by Sysco or US Foods, if there is a change of control on some Broadline facilities that you might need to divest, how would you deal with the issue of those national accounts and who's going to supply them under a change of control for any regional Broadline facilities? ", "Bill DeLaney", "As you say we\u2019re not going to comment on that. It\u2019s all part of it. That discussion, Ajay, is all part of the process.", "Ajay Jain \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald", "Okay, thanks. If I could just ask one final question, you talked about higher corporate and payroll expenses, but can you comment on the level of integration and planning costs we should assume going forward? Does that spending moderate or could it potentially be higher over the balance of the year, based on how you're allocating those costs? \u2013 ", "Chris Kreidler", "Good question. What I said earlier was I don't know that we will be running at the same intensity that we we've done over the last 10 months. I'm not going to sit here and expect them to moderate or diminish significantly but I think we\u2019re probably seeing a peak and we\u2019re probably going to be flat to moderately down. I'm saying that without actually having a forecast in front of me but I don't anticipate any new significant expenditures in the way of merger integration expenses other than some of the ones we called out in terms of interest expense and things like that which will continue to account to the certain item until we close. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "I have two questions please. First you mentioned in your prepared remarks turnover and shortages related to your delivery drivers I assume. Is that fixable with compensation, is there anything else to kind of understand why you are seeing a pickup in turnover there? In other words, is it something that you can reverse or has the market for these individuals gotten that much more competitive? ", "Bill DeLaney", "John, Bill, I think it's fixable in most markets. I think there\u2019s things that as we brought in some of our talent acquisition to work in the more central locations it\u2019s taken us some time as an organization to adjust just to see how that works between the OpCo and the shared services groups. So we've had some challenges out there and we have addressed those. I would expect from that standpoint things will get better. ", "With that said, there's a handful of markets just because of the underlying economy and in particular drilling where it\u2019s very difficult to compete for drivers \u2013 nationally there is a shortage of drivers. So I think it\u2019s all manageable, it\u2019s just harder to manage today than what it\u2019s ben and I would expect that you'll see an improvement there over the 6 to 12 months.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan", "And secondly, just a question on the restaurant industry. We did see \u2013 I am really talking about the casual dining data but I think this is true for QSR in general as well -- a pickup in August, September, even into October especially relative to July and July being I think the highest volume month in the quarter which was actually the lowest month in the quarter on a year-on-year basis. Is that kind of what you're seeing in the broader data as well like in other words July was the low point in the quarter and that\u2019s since picked up or could you comment a little bit more in the industry? ", "Bill DeLaney", "I actually don't know that I've seen that. My sense at least from for example, some of the feedback we get in surveys from operators is that July and August were stronger and September they weren't as you said about what was going on in the business and maybe their outlook. It's still good. The metrics we're looking at, people are still reasonably optimistic of the operators going forward but my sense is actually it was stronger earlier in the summer than in September. ", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.", "Andrew Rubin \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, this is Andrew Rubin on for Vinnie. You just touched upon it a bit, but I was wondering if you could talk about your sales cadence for the quarter, if there were any trends in that? In terms of, with the hiring increases, if that started to flow through on the sales side or generally, the timing until you see that start to flow through? ", "Bill DeLaney", "I am sorry, the part of the question?", "Andrew Rubin \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Just sales cadence through the quarter if there's anything to call out. ", "Bill DeLaney", "Sales gains?", "Andrew Rubin \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Cadence. If it was stronger in any one month or accelerating, decelerating?", "Bill DeLaney", "I think you\u2019re going back to John's question -- again I am trying to make distinctions here where at least the data we see is not that distinguishable. So, no, I would say the cadence obviously was good. It\u2019s hard to pin down week to week but I think the biggest thing as we look at our numbers is just the inflation stayed strong in those categories throughout the quarter. But we saw growth throughout each month and as we said we\u2019re seeing bulk on the locally managed and corporate management side of the business. So I wouldn\u2019t say there's anything overly dramatic or material that would separate one part of the quarter from the quarter.", "Chris Kreidler", "The second part of your question I think was around \u2013 was it a impact from the hiring of MA and I think it\u2019s \u2013 Bill obviously will jump in here \u2013 it takes a while before newly hired MAs trainees as we call them begin to have an impact on your sales volume. So MAs that we hired 6, 9 months ago will start having an impact but those that we\u2019ve hired in the last quarter or two really aren\u2019t driving that sales volume yet.", "Bill DeLaney", "I think that\u2019s right. I think what is helping \u2013 what I also alluded to earlier is the fact that we\u2019re 9 to 12 months past these territory reductions. So there\u2019s just more stability in sales force right now, we\u2019re getting better at implementing these initiatives. I think our sales force and sales management team are in a better place in terms of just the day to day aspect of the business.", "Andrew Rubin \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then just to touch on the inflation side, with this coming in a little higher for the quarter, has your outlook changed in terms of what you're potentially seeing for when this may moderate or inflation outlook for the rest of the year? ", "Bill DeLaney", "I think it\u2019s going to be with us for a while. Dairy is a category that \u2013 it\u2019s not quite like \u2013 but dairy tends to go up and down a little faster than the others But from what we read here certainly in the meat side of the business, we expect to continue to see inflation there for the next several months probably. So right now I don\u2019t tend to go out too far with my thinking here but I would think over the next six months, could migrate a little bit at some point but I think we\u2019re going to still have a fair amount of inflation.

Good morning. And welcome to Sysco Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. We will begin today\u2019s call with opening remarks and introductions.", "I would like to turn the call over to Shannon Mutschler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Shannon Mutschler", "Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Sysco\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Today you\u2019ll hear prepared remarks from Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Kreidler, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note, that statements made during this presentation that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company\u2019s SEC filings.", "This includes but is not limited to risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 28, 2014, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com or via Sysco IR app.", "Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation and can be also found in the Investors section of our website.", "All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In addition, all references to case volume include total Broadline and SYGMA combined.", "To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions today we\u2019d like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you, Shannon, and hello, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported second quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased nearly 8% to $12.1 billion and adjusted net earnings increased 6% to $245 million. Adjusted EPS increased 5% to $0.41 for the quarter.", "Our second quarter financial results were generally in line with our expectations, as we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance. Most important, our associates remained highly focused on providing excellent service to our customers in what remains an extremely competitive market environment.", "We generated nearly 4% case volume growth during the quarter and effectively managed acute inflationary pressures in our meat and dairy categories. Specifically, case growth trends in our locally managed Broadline business were favorable in most of the geographic markets we serve. In addition, we generated solid case growth once again with our corporate managed customers in the restaurant and travel and leisure segments.", "Our performance during the quarter was due in part to the benefits we realized from our portfolio of business transformation initiatives, especially category management. As our ability to effectively integrate these initiatives in our steady-state operating activities has improved consistently over time.", "While we are pleased with our overall performance during the quarter, we did fall short of our expense management targets. Expense increases were driven primarily by higher incentive accruals, selling cost and delivery cost. Excluding certain items and the unfavorable impact of incentive accruals, operating expenses increased 4%.", "As I\u2019ve mentioned previously, Sysco\u2019s single largest opportunity for improvement remains more consistent execution across the organization. We are implementing tools to provide increased visibility to key performance metrics, as well as improved best practices. While we are seeing some level of improvement in this area and believe we are on the right path, we have more work to do.", "Regarding overall industry trends, current restaurant data shows modest signs of gradual improvement. NPD, which tracks restaurant trends, recently reported positive traffic growth in the mid-scale and casual dining sectors for the first time since 2008.", "This is encouraging news as the casual dining sector includes a significant number of independent restaurant customers, for whom we provide substantial value-added products and services.", "In addition, consumer confidence and employment metrics are, for the most part showing improvement. We are hopeful, lower fuel prices will further improve the customers -- the consumer outlook and lead to sustainable increase traffic and spend for our customer base.", "We remain intently focused on enhancing every aspect of our business. So that we are able to better support our customers, operate more efficiently and compete more effectively.", "Benefits from our category management initiative continued to gain momentum. We expect that all categories representing approximately $15 billion in annual spend will be launched into the market by the end of this fiscal year and that we will achieve the three-year cost savings target that we established prior to the start of fiscal 2013.", "In addition, we are working with our suppliers in a more strategic and effective way that we believe provides a meaningful platform for growth and innovation in our respective businesses.", "Turning to an update in our technology initiatives, we continue our merger integration planning with regards to technology and have begun certain fundamental projects necessary for integration.", "As we move forward in deploying our ERP platform our approaches continue to evolve. For instance, we have focused on broad implementations at the operating companies for several years, with a plan to convert the hub where our shared business services facility last.", "However, we have found that this created inefficiencies at SBS that would make further rollouts challenging. Thus, we are now moving forward with the rollout of SAP financial modules for general ledger, accounts payable and accounts receivable, as well as additional elements of the HR module, all of which are intended to make SBS more effectively in the near-term and make future ERP conversions at the operating companies relatively easier.", "While focusing on operational excellence is a key area for us we also have important work underway to identify new markets with opportunity for profitable growth. As we discussed last quarter, we\u2019ve developed a robust approach to serve the fast-growing Hispanic restaurant sector.", "We estimate that we have 10% to 15% of this $10 billion foodservice market and believe we have a significant opportunity to better serve these customers and grow our sales. We made additional strides of this effort recently with the launch of our new multi-lingual website dedicated to support customers in this segment.", "The site includes news, tips, menu ideas and trend data intended to help Hispanic operators drive restaurant traffic, improve their operations and better address their customer's evolving needs. I\u2019m extremely proud of the efforts and accomplishments of our leadership team over the last several months.", "As we announced last August, Mike Green retired from Sysco at the end of the calendar -- at the end of the calendar year after 24 years of distinguished service. On January 1st, Tom Bene became Executive Vice President and President, Food Service Operations, succeeding Mike. Tom reports to me and has responsibility for all business operations, sales, merchandising, marketing and revenue management.", "Tom is a proven commercial leader with deep expertise and a strong track record in the food service industry. Since joining Sysco early in 2013, he has helped drive major advances in category management, revenue management, sales capability and customer insights from segmentation. We\u2019re fortunate to have such a capable leader to succeed Mike.", "In addition and also effective January 1, 2015, Scott Charlton, Senior Vice President, Distribution Services, now reports to me in an expanded role. Scott leads end-to-end supply chain operations, including warehousing, inbound and outbound transportation and replenishment. Scott joined Sysco in 2013 as well and brings great energy and expertise to our senior leadership team.", "Turning to an update on our proposed merger with the US Foods. Over the past 12 months, we have worked in good faith with the FTC, providing millions of pages of documents and explaining to them our industry and the merits of our proposed merger. We strongly believe that the combination of Sysco and US Foods will promote competition in where it's already a highly competitive industry by positioning us to provide significant value to our customers, including lower cost.", "Unfortunately, the FTC has taken a different view of the potential competitive impacts of the merger. While we respectfully but vigorously disagree with the FTC\u2019s analysis, we announced today a substantial divestiture package that we believe fully addresses their concerns.", "At this time, the FTC has not agreed to this solution. So we will now present our position, including this proposed remedy, to the five FTC commissioners and seek to obtain their approval. We remain convinced that the proposed transaction is good for our customers, our associates and our shareholders.", "In closing, I'm pleased with our operating performance through the first half of our fiscal year. Case growth and sales growth were up 3% and 7% respectively, while adjusted operating income and EPS grew at a rate of 5% and 6% respectively.", "In addition, many of our strategic business initiatives are gaining traction and contributing to these results. As we move forward into the remainder of our fiscal year, we are committed to improving the consistency of our operational execution, successfully rolling out our portfolio of initiatives and further developing our plans to integrate Sysco and US Foods. This is a critical time in our history and we believe the strategic actions we're taking are vital to both strengthening our customer relationships and providing solid returns to our shareholders over the long term.", "Now I\u2019ll turn things over to Chris, so he could provide additional details on our financial results for the second quarter as well as the agreement we announced this morning with Performance Food Group.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. For the second quarter, sales were $12.1 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to prior year. Food cost inflation was 6%, driven mainly by double-digit inflation in the meat and dairy categories.", "Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.8% and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rate decreased sales by 0.9%. Case volume grew 3.6% during the quarter including acquisitions and approximately 3.3% excluding acquisitions. Gross profit in the second quarter was $2.1 billion, a 6.1% increase. And gross margin declined 23 basis points to 17.25%.", "Benefits from category management contributed to our gross profit performance during the quarter. In addition, case volume growth advanced from the prior quarter and this increased demand aiding gross profit performance. In our higher margin locally managed Broadline business, case volume growth remained relatively steady and accelerated with our corporate managed customers.", "Certain items for the quarter totaled $133 million and primarily related to merger and integration planning expenses. Of this amount, $81 million was recorded in operating expense and $52 million was recorded in interest expense. Merger and integration planning expenses that impacted operating expense were associated with professional fees to assist us in managing integration planning as well as the legal and IT related projects.", "Work-related integration planning peaked in the second quarter and costs related to these efforts should decline going forward. Merger and integration expenses that impacted interest expense relate to the debt issuance during the quarter that is intended to finance US Foods debt upon closing of the merger.", "We're trading this interest expense of this certain item until the merger closes. After excluding certain items, adjusted operating expense for the quarter increased $108 million or 6.8% compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by $115 million increase in payroll expense resulting from several factors.", "First, during last year second quarter, we reduced certain management incentive accruals based on our performance versus our objectives at that time. And this year\u2019s second quarter, these same incentives are generally accrued at higher amounts, reflecting the impact of our recent performance and causing a year-over-year variance of $41 million. Excluding this year-over-year difference in incentive accruals, adjusted operating expenses would have increased only 4.2%.", "Second, pay to our sales organization was higher as a result of growth in gross profit dollars. These are costs we would expect to see given our performance for the quarter. Sales cost also increased although to a lesser extent as a result of hiring additional marketing associates over the last year.", "As we discussed last quarter, some of this increase in MAs is related to normal hiring to replace attrition and support growth. However, certain markets added MAs because they lost more than they planned when we implemented our sales reorganization a couple of years ago. As a reminder, it takes roughly 18 months for an MA to be fully productive.", "Third, as we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters, we continue to experience higher delivery costs in our Broadline operations. As Bill mentioned, we have a number of initiatives that are in various stages of implementation that we anticipate will help to reduce these costs and increase productivity to mitigate these increases.", "And lastly, payroll increased due to the newly acquired operations, including Metropolitan Poultry, the joint venture in Costa Rica we entered into last fiscal year and Iowa Premium Beef. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $396 million, up 3.1% for the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 3.3%, down 14 basis points from last year.", "Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.1% compared to 35.4% in the prior year period. The majority of this change is the result of reduced state taxes from legal restructuring as well as a growing base of business in international jurisdictions that have lower tax rate. Adjusted net earnings increased 5.5% to $245 million and adjusted EPS increased 5.1% to $0.41.", "Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations declined $6 million to $452 million for the first half of the fiscal year. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by two items. First, the cash impact of certain items increased $96 million year-over-year, mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses.", "Second, we made a $50 million pension contribution in the first half of this year, compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding, when we make cash contribution each year.", "With respect to working capital, our usage increased year-over-year mainly due to an increase in sales and inventory, driven by increased inflation and case growth. Cash tax payments for the first half of the fiscal year were $179 million, lower than last year due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced the taxable earnings.", "Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets totaled $296 million for the first half of the fiscal year, compared to $247 million last year. Roughly, half of the $49 million year-over-year increase is due to the timing of investments in our fleet, with remainder coming from IT projects that are related to integration planning.", "Free cash flow was $157 million in the first half of this fiscal year, compared to $211 million in the prior year period. These results include the $96 million increase in the cash impact of certain items to cash flows from operations and the $50 million increase in pension contributions I mentioned earlier, as well as a $16 million increase in capital spending related to merger integration.", "After adjusting for these items, free cash flow was $324 million or an increase of $107 million. As we discussed last quarter, in October, we issued $5 billion in debt, the proceeds of the offering are unintended to fund the various elements of US Foods\u2019 transaction.", "As we closed on the new debt issuance, we simultaneously terminated both the bridge facility and the related free issuance hedges, both of which were put in place as part of the financing strategy for the merger. Following the unwinding of the hedges, we paid $59 million in September to settle that hedge against our 10-year note issuance.", "In October, we paid a $130 million to settle the hedge against our third-year debt issuance, which is shown as the financing activities in our cash flow statement in the second fiscal quarter. The financial impact of the unwind of the hedges will be amortized into earnings over 10 years and 30 years respectively.", "Regarding our outlook into the third quarter and the remainder at the year, there were several additional items I\u2019d like to point out. First, as discussed on the last quarter\u2019s call, we continued to implement our category management initiative as planned and are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in integrating this approach to our business. A favorable year-over-year impact has been meaningful to our performance over the last three quarters, but we expect it will begin to moderate in the fourth quarter.", "Second, regarding cost per case in our North American Broadline business, we had communicated in the last quarter that we expect that it would be difficult to meet our objective of keeping cost per case flat year-over-year. For the first half of the year, cost per case increased $0.10. While, we expect year-over-year cost increases to moderate in the second half of the year, we no longer expect cost per case to be flat for the full year. Instead, we now anticipate an increase of approximately $0.05 to $0.10 for the fiscal year.", "Third, with regard to fuel expense, we have been evaluating the impact on our business of the recent decline in crude prices. While diesel prices have declined more than 20% over the course of the fiscal year, our program of entering into forward fuel purchase contracts smoothes the impact of price changes over time.", "As a result, we did not have a material change in fuel expense in the second quarter or first half of this fiscal year. However, we do expect a roughly $15 million decline in fuel expense over the second half of the fiscal year. This modest projected benefit will likely be offset to some degree by lower fuel surcharges.", "Fourth, as a reminder, we continue to expect to report approximately $40 million in incremental merger related interest expense per quarter, which we will exclude from our adjusted numbers until the close of the merger.", "And finally, I wanted to speak for a moment about our outlook for share repurchases. Our approach to repurchases for the last several years has been to buyback shares throughout the year, with the goal of keeping shares outstanding relatively constant.", "However, during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying shares due to the pending merger. This is half the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first half of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employees\u2019 stock options and RSU grants.", "We are not prepared to comment about if, or when we may resume buying back shares. However, if we bought no shares for the remainder of the year, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding may be greater than $597 million shares for the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock exercises that occur and does not include the impact of the shares to be issued in conjunction with the proposed US Foods merger.", "Turning to an update on our proposed merger with US Foods, we believe that the divestiture agreement we announced today fully addresses the FTC\u2019s concerns. Upon closing of the Sysco- US Foods merger, this definitive agreement will include selling 11 US Foods operating locations, representing $4.6 billion in annual sales to Performance Food Group.", "Sysco would receive $850 million in cash in return from PFG. The divested markets will expand Performance Food Group's geographic footprint in the U.S. and enable it to compete more effectively for both larger and smaller customers. The divested locations are Corona, California; Denver, Colorado; Kansas City, Kansas; Phoenix, Arizona; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Cleveland, Ohio; Las Vegas, Nevada and Minneapolis, Minnesota.", "In addition, Sysco and Performance Food Group have signed a multi-year transition services agreement to ensure a smooth transfer of assets from US Foods to Performance Food Group. As PSA provides various support services and personnel to help Performance Food Group succeed as the new business owner in these locations.", "Clearly, this development has implications for our synergy expectations. It\u2019s important to remember that integration planning work has been underway over the past year, which has enabled us to refine and enhance our confidence in our synergy estimates. As a direct result of this work, we determine that growth synergies related to the transaction were substantially higher than previous estimates.", "After reducing our revised synergy estimates to reflect the facilities to be divested, we now expect net annualized operating synergies to be at least $600 million after four years. Our current expectation is that operating synergies will begin to accumulate in year two, following the close of the transaction.", "In addition to operating synergies, there were substantial financial synergies related to the transaction, including interest savings, totaling approximately $150 million annually and cash tax savings from the realization of acquired NOLs, totaling approximately $150 million. We expect to realize both of these financial synergies in the first year, following the close of the transaction.", "We have also updated our expectations regarding the cost to integrate the two companies. We continue to expect that incremental merger expenses will total approximately $700 million to $800 million over four years. In addition, we expect the incremental capital spend to require to integrate with total approximately $300 million to $400 million over four years.", "Now, while the actual gross cost to integrate will be higher than those incremental costs I just mentioned, we expect to fund a portion of these costs from our current operating and capital expense run rates. We now expect the transaction to be accretive in the second year following the close of the transaction, excluding cost to integrate the company and deal-related amortization.", "And with that, operator, we will now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.", "Karen Short", "Hi. So just to focus on the transaction a little bit. I mean, maybe can you give some color on where you think the issues are with the FTC in terms of you both not being in agreement? And then maybe follow-up, just some color on the facilities that are being divested, the customer type EBITDA associated with the facilities, things like that?", "Bill DeLaney", "Good morning, Karen. I will start and I don\u2019t know how far Chris can go with that second part, but I will give a shot at that. One of the things we want to be carefully of this one is that, we don\u2019t want to be in a position where we\u2019re trying to articulate a point of view with the FTC. They will have plenty of opportunity to do that.", "So what I would say is a good, a very high percentage of the conversation over the last several weeks and really months has been around their concern of -- they believe that there is a national market. They believe that there are customers out there that will only buy from distributors who have a national footprint. We disagree with that. We see and live that every day where customers -- some of these larger customers will buy from multiple distributors, they might buy from regionals or multi-regionals, they may buy from us and/or US or PFG, and they obviously buy from specialty firms. Some may buy from only a few of us. Some may actually put most of their business with one or two of us. But our point of view is that when we compete for that business, we are competing not just with US Food and PFG, but DMA, but with a lot of regionals, who are now multi-regionals.", "And even in the situation where certain customers will work with a fewer number of distributors that opportunity to work with more is always in the room when you are negotiation our peer new business. So, I think, again, I can\u2019t make their case for them, but I think that\u2019s been where we spent a lot of the time in the conversation of how we address their concerns about how these customers continue to get good service and appropriate pricing.", "And that is why we ultimately, even though we disagree with the position, we are willing to put forth the divestiture package which we believe from our perspective, based on our knowledge of the business, our knowledge of the competitive landscape should allow PFG to go out and compete very well in the way that the FTC would hope. So that\u2019s my best way of describing it today. As we've said, we will have some more opportunity to speak with the FTC and the five commissioners here over the next week or two and I am sure there will be more information coming out of those meetings.", "Karen Short", "Okay. And can you provide us with any color on the customer types of those facilities and EBITDA dollars? And I guess just a follow-on on that. In terms of the synergy number, is the $600 million synergy, does that actually include any operating profits associated with the TSA PFG?", "Chris Kreidler", "So on the first part of your question, Karen, I am not going to get into the detail of facilities or the EBITDA, the package, but I will generally say, because I think it addresses what you\u2019re trying to get out there that it is a representative package, if you will, of US Foods. I don\u2019t think there is a disproportionate amount higher or lower of EBITDA or disproportionate type of customer services out of these facilities than US Food as a whole. That is generally correct, but I am going to leave it there just in terms of describing these package of facilities.", "I am sorry. Remind me the other part of your question, please?", "Karen Short", "Well the $600 million, I mean you obviously said during this whole integration process, you\u2019ve identified additional synergies, but you\u2019re very comfortable with the $600 million that you originally put out there? I am just wondering if the $600 million includes operating. I\u2019d assume there is operating profit associated with the TSA, with PFG, does that $600 million include?", "Chris Kreidler", "No, it doesn\u2019t include any operating profit associated with the TSA. TSAs typically are constructed so that you\u2019re reimbursed for your costs, you don\u2019t technically make any money. If you do, it\u2019s very small amounts of money, but the way these things are constructed, you usually just reimburse for your expenses.", "Karen Short", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "We will move on to our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel", "So just a few questions on the -- right on the transaction, the $600 million, that does not include any financial synergies, correct? Number two, when you found incremental synergies right beyond what you\u2019re thinking before, is that more buckets that you hadn\u2019t anticipated or buckets that are just bigger? And if there are buckets that are bigger, what might one or two of those buckets be? And then lastly, I assume all other terms of the purchase on your end remain the same, that none of that has changed, that\u2019s it?", "Chris Kreidler", "Okay. John, if I can, I will take those in reverse order.", "John Heinbockel", "Yes, sure.", "Chris Kreidler", "Yes, nothing changes in the transaction that we had negotiated with US Foods. That remains the same in all aspects. You are correct on the first question you asked. The financial synergies I described which the two biggest ones are interest savings over the two combined pro formas and the use of the NOLs, those are not included in the $600 million. Financial synergies, we expect to achieve in the first year after closing the operational synergies, we expect to start occurring in the second year after closing.", "And then the middle question there really around where we would find the additional synergies? When we put our first synergy number out on the table I feel like I have to keep reminding ourselves as well as everybody else, it was with essentially publicly available information. We didn\u2019t have a lot of additional information. We had some experience at Sysco dealing with some of these buckets of opportunities. We had done some category management work. We have done route optimization. And so we knew that this is what we\u2019ve been able to do, what can we do if you can buy and then we made some assumptions. And we made prudent assumptions but not overly really aggressive. We are going to be candid about that.", "As we\u2019ve learned a lot more about this, I would say every bucket probably increase in size, certainly around merchandising and supply chain, it will say inbound and outbound delivery transportation. Those buckets got quite a lot larger. So we\u2019ve found it across the board, but in certain places we found more. And so we rebuilt synergies from the bottom up using more information through our integration planning efforts. There is still a lot of information we are not allowed to have access to and we are abiding by all those rules. So we expect that when we eventually close and we get access to some additional information, we will true this up again. But we\u2019ve made pretty good assumptions and we are still being what I would call prudent. We are not being overly aggressive or overly conservative.", "John Heinbockel", "All right. And then lastly, you talked about wanting to sort of tighten up expense control, where are the biggest opportunities? And then secondly, is that something that can be done while you are in the early stages of doing the US Food integration, or is that something that has to come later?", "Bill DeLaney", "John, I will start there as well. I think in terms of the biggest opportunities, they are generally always going to be on the operational side. So some of our G&A costs are up this year, a fair amount of that was planned some of the work we are doing with these initiatives in the technology area.", "Our selling costs are up a little more than we planned, but our gross profit is higher. So that one doesn\u2019t concern me as much. That takes you to the supply chain operations, and we\u2019ve just got more work to do there in terms of improving our productivity at a rate commensurate with where our costs go up. And we tend to be very good in this area but we\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives going on in this area as well.", "I\u2019ve mentioned Scott and he has been with us a couple of years. And with our new enterprise structure, his functional group working hand in hand with our operating company leadership to basically strike the right balance between what we need to do support our customers each and every day but also putting better and more consistent best practices, monitor them better, get our compensation schemes in line with our productivity. So a lot of work to be done in that area and more to do but I would say, that\u2019s what the biggest opportunity is.", "Bill DeLaney", "As far as the merger, I would say, on the merger, Chris talked to this. And I let him address it again. I think we\u2019re seeing opportunities through these synergies to do better. The challenge there will be to do what we\u2019ve done, a nice job so far. I mean, so far, when you hear me speak, we\u2019d be really proud as management team and frankly all of our folks.", "We\u2019ve done a nice job of being able to separate all the work and all the hours and the pressure is going on with the integration planning and still be able to run our business pretty well. So that\u2019s the biggest challenge I see post close here as to -- continue to run these businesses but drive out at that point of synergies. So I think, when we get to that point, we\u2019ll talk to you more and we\u2019ll have to come up with some ways to speak to how we\u2019re making progress here and still making sure we\u2019re shipping groceries in the right way to our customers.", "John Heinbockel", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Greg Badishkanian from Citi.", "Fred Wightman", "Hi. Good morning. This is actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. Last quarter you guys mentioned that there were some labor shortages in delivery drivers, has that situation abated? And are you guys seeing any other pockets of labor pressure?", "Bill DeLaney", "Good morning. We did speak to that. We still have some of those situations. It\u2019s abated some. The source of that is really two-fold, one, over the last few years -- we will see what the next few months bring with the price of oil but over the last few years, several of our markets are very much energy driven or intensive. There is a lot of good jobs out there on the energy side. Some of those jobs are very competitive or more competitive in terms of lifestyle and wages to what we offer. And so in those markets where energy has been strong, we struggled to some extent, too early to tell if that\u2019s going to abate.", "The other part quite candidly is we\u2019ve had some internal issues in certain markets where as we\u2019ve centralized some of our hiring practices and begun to coordinate that process between the OpCo and our SBS center.", "Certainly, we went pretty fast and aggressively and there were some markets where we didn't execute as well we should have. So we're also catching up in those areas. So there is still a handful out there too that we have some issues but it has abated and I would expect it to continue to improve.", "Fred Wightman", "And then you briefly mentioned this in your response to the last question but you mentioned that some geographies were performing better than others? Have you seen that trend become more pronounced especially in some of these oil producing regions?", "Bill DeLaney", "I\u2019d say, it\u2019s pretty pronounced in Southwest and we\u2019re seeing that for several quarters now. I would also tell you -- interesting right now when we look at the numbers up December, January or early February, if you recall, we had some really severe weather last year when we had -- we\u2019re getting more weather now over the last week or two. As you look at the markets, you can kind of see where the weather impacted last year and whether weather didn\u2019t impact last year.", "So I would say, the Southwest and the West Coast, in particular, were doing well. It\u2019s hard to tell how much of that is the market and how much of that is our leadership in those markets but those two in particular. And right now looks like quarter is off to a pretty good start in terms of their season.", "Operator", "Moving on, we\u2019ll take Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to check, Chris, on moving the accretion to your two -- what that means for dilution in year one? I don\u2019t know if you saw but I did put on my own estimate around $0.15 if you divested $5 billion of US Foods service assets and I just used value as I think suggested just their average blended operating margin. Just would like to know, if you think that\u2019s at least in the ballpark in terms of reasonableness?", "Chris Kreidler", "Andrew, I would -- I have to be very careful to comment about your own estimates and your own modeling, so apologies for that. But look, originally, we believe based upon initial modeling that we thought it would be accretive in year one as we have refined all of our estimates, not just the numbers but the timing of the numbers and then overlaid the divestitures, we think its year two that is accretive.", "Frankly, I\u2019m not prepared to talk about year one dilution or anything yet. We\u2019ve got more work that we need to do to pin that down. So best I can tell you is we\u2019ve shifted some stuff based upon when we think we\u2019re going to be rolling certain initiatives and where -- how we think we\u2019re going to go after some of the synergies and that\u2019s affected our -- when we\u2019re going to achieve accretion.", "Andrew Wolf", "But I mean, you would as well as the divestures, I mean, clearly your \u2026", "Chris Kreidler", "Yes.", "Andrew Wolf", "\u2026selling them below what you\u2019re paying for? Okay.", "Chris Kreidler", "Yes.", "Andrew Wolf", "Just wanted to ask a procedural question on the FTC, I think it\u2019s all implied but I just want to make sure I understand it. It sounds -- so you secured agreements from the commissioners to meet with them, the five commissioners and to make your case? And does that been -- have they then agreed to vote what they want to conduct their vote at that point, once you've done in the next few weeks meeting with them or the next couple weeks?", "Bill DeLaney", "Look Andy, I think there is one thing I think at this point of the FTC we do agree on is that its time to move this process forward. And we have plenty of time to talk and educate and listen and negotiate or whatever. So what we\u2019re at is they basically signal to us that it\u2019s time to meet with the commissioners and so we\u2019re preparing to do that. And of course along the way, since they\u2019ve signaled for quite time their concern.", "They\u2019ve articulated earlier, we\u2019ve had parallel discussions with PFG. And so we\u2019re able to poll that agreement together here over the weekend. We just fell it would be in everyone's best interest, including our customers and our associates to kind of have better knowledge of what\u2019s really going on. There has been a lot of weeks, so we just fell it made a lot of sense. If we\u2019re going to visit with the commissioners to have this agreement in place so that we can look them in the eye and tell them exactly what we are prepared to do and there is no uncertainty in terms of our ability to do it. So that\u2019s a little color, I guess from my end. Chris, you want to add anything on process?", "Chris Kreidler", "Actually, I think that covers it well. One thing probably I\u2019m going to speak a lot to is what happened after we meet with the commissioners. There is nothing defined at that point. That is the next step that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about and it\u2019s hard to talk half that point but that\u2019s what we are. Its time to move this thing forward as Bill said.", "Andrew Wolf", "And just one other thing on this the deal on talking with the commissioners. Now the PFG deal, is it -- how would you think of your sense of how the commissioners view that deal as it stands? You think it\u2019s ambiguous. Have they signaled that that is not enough that could be enough or is it I guess, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to discover. How should we think about whether the deal you struck with PFG is going to way with the FTC commissioner?", "Bill DeLaney ", "I think you should look at it from the perspective of what we\u2019re saying, which is we\u2019ve had a lot of time and a lot of opportunity to have discussions with the FTC and as well as address remedies to concerns that they have, which we don\u2019t share but which we certainly want to address because, it\u2019s disruptive type business, it\u2019s disruptive to the business that we are acquiring and it\u2019s disruptive to our customers. So, we are trying to find a remedy here and obviously they haven\u2019t agreed anything at this point. So, I think it will be determined.", "Andrew Wolf", "Okay. Can I just ask one another, just a number question on the adjustment statement? The $78 million in merger integration costs this quarter was about $40.5 million last quarter and talking about the last quarter was mainly consultants. Chris, you might have talked about this, maybe I didn\u2019t understand it. But what is the majority of that stuff up in the merger spending?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah. It is mainly consultants, yeah. But that\u2019s majority of that $78 million is what we call professional fees for outside consultants that are helping us. Some of the uptick came from legal, from the fact that we have started some foundational IT projects that are going to be necessary for integration, so some of that stuff kicked in to the quarter. As we also said though, our merger integration planning it\u2019s -- I think the word we use and it\u2019s probably the word, a peak. It will be coming down from there and so that\u2019s what we work for the quarter.", "Andrew Wolf", "Okay. Thank you, and good luck with everything. Thank you.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thanks, Andy.", "Operator", "Meredith Adler with Barclays has our next question.", "Meredith Adler", "Very informative. I\u2019ll actually go back and talk a little bit about operations and just want to understand. You had 6% food inflation and when you do the simple math, you wouldn\u2019t end up with volume growth of 3.3%. But obviously what that means is that you have the inflation, but your sales didn\u2019t go up necessarily by 6% because of inflation. Is that right?", "Bill DeLaney", "As you\u2019ve stated that\u2019s right. Is this -- is the question why?", "Meredith Adler", "Well, I may guess that the assumption then would be that you are still having trouble passing a long inflation?", "Bill DeLaney", "I think there is many of reasons, Meredith. I think some of it is mix, right. So, lot of inflation is in this higher dollar cost, boxes of meat and dairy this last quarter. So it\u2019s partially mix. It\u2019s certainly is partially, as I\u2019ve talked in the past alone to your point. So one of the things we do with customers continually, especially now is to try to listen to them, understand what their needs are, understand where they are going with their menu. And if there is some more cost effective ways for them to buy from us and to still position their menu, advantage is where and that\u2019s what we do.", "So if they can offer more poultry dishes or other types of ally card items that is the plan maybe what they\u2019ve formally done with cheese or with beef then, there is some of that going on as well. I mean, our case growth still is very good in these inflationary categories I think it\u2019s the mix I think it\u2019s -- trying to find the right price point if you will for our customers.", "And I think it is hard to imagine inflation, but our point is we\u2019ve been doing a better job of it here over the last year or two. And I think category management speed is beginning to help also and some of our other initiatives in terms of product training, in terms of our sales people being able to sit down have good propel conversations with our customers. So it\u2019s a lot of things, but probably mix would be as big as any.", "Meredith Adler", "And those comments about mix, is it fair to assume that the category management process has come up with -- I won\u2019t say identical, but similar kinds of things? I mean, you\u2019ve said in the past that it\u2019s not just about reducing SKUs. So category management is about helping the customer buy better items, or more cost effective items?", "Bill DeLaney", "No, not exactly, what we -- the goal is with category management is to help our customers and ourselves frankly optimize -- in our case optimize their SKUs over time, There is plenty of work still to be down there, help them use those products that we are bringing to them to augment their menu in the right way, maybe changing up a bit makes sense. But for both of us to make commitments for the customer to commit with us and for us to commit with our suppliers to take cost out of the system and to be able to buy these products better, and to realize those savings both on Sysco\u2019s bottom line as well as the bottom line. And I think, we are starting to see nice traction there on that part of it. Longer-term, we as an opportunity to really differentiate ourselves in the marketplace with expanded product lines, maybe broader not as deep, perhaps in some of the SKUs they don\u2019t move as fast where we can have more customize offerings to customers as we better understand their needs and better understand the process. And then also use this platform to bring more innovation to the offering. So in the short-term, I would look at it as an opportunity to partner more strategically with our customers, buy more efficiently, and to pass some of those savings along to the customer base. And for both of us to optimize our SKUs with the long-term goal of being able to really bring more innovation and more differentiation to the product line.", "Meredith Adler", "That\u2019s very helpful. And then just one quick question, maybe for Chris about fuel surcharges. Can you say how much of the cost -- it\u2019s hard because you\u2019ve been hedged, but if you give up the fuel surcharges, how much does that offset the benefit of lower fuel prices?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah. Let me come at that from this direction. First, I mean, fuel charges are a bit different, when you think about it with our larger customers and our smaller customers. With larger customers, we may have contracts that are pegged to certain fuel price. They may go up, they may go down. They last for periods of time. That\u2019s not something that you just \u201cgive up\u201d because they were structured into the cost structure of the contract. Fuel surcharges on the street are different and obviously they can change on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.", "So the concept of quote, giving them up doesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s harder for me to address. I will say this. We look at fuel, when we look at what\u2019s happening to fuel. We did not raise fuel surcharges, when fuel prices started going up and that was kind of one of the luxuries of our forward buying strategy. It gave us time to asses what was really going on before we needed to react. Now that they are coming down, we are looking at it actively to see what\u2019s appropriate in the market and for our customers and we\u2019ll continue to look at that.", "But we wanted to flag is, it\u2019s a big story out there. There is a reason why it doesn\u2019t impact our fuel cost because of the way we smooth on an ongoing basis. So it hasn\u2019t in the first half, we are flagging that it will, to the extent at least to $15 million, which is in our overall cost structure is a very small amount. But that\u2019s what we need to look at when we think about the fuel surcharges, how much of that amount might need to be mitigated with adjustments to the surcharge.", "Meredith Adler", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move on to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Kelly", "Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning.", "Chris Kreidler", "Good morning, Ed.", "Edward Kelly", "Two quick questions for you. Chris, just one follow-up on the $600 million in synergies. Since -- ever since the deal was announced, there was lots of talk around potential negative synergies from things that customer overlap. I don't know to what extent you\u2019ve had the ability to take a deeper look at that and maybe some color there would be good and also the $600 million net. Does that basically contemplate any possible negative synergies as well?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah. Look, we continue to look at that. Early on, we obviously needed to make some assumptions just to figure out what we thought an appropriate, what the return would be in, whether it was an appropriate return to the amount of investments. So, we made some assumptions. As we\u2019ve gone toward the integration planning process, we\u2019ve continued to refine our thinking there and one thing I can tell you is there is no good science around predicting that. I can make a guess, you can make a guesses, and we could be wildly different in our guesses.", "And then secondly, there is no real way to measure it even after the fact. So what we\u2019ve done instead is just try to get into what would cause a customer to want to leave and then what can we do reason by reason to medicate that risk. And so we\u2019ve spent an inordinate amount of time through all of our integration planning teams to go after those issues.", "Everything that we are working on is based on the principle of we want to make this as at least disruptive to our customers as we possibly can, our customer and US Food\u2019s customers as we possibly can. And so we are not spending a lot of time trying to estimate potential disruption or losses of customers. We are spending all of our time trying to make sure that we know what might cause them to leave and how we\u2019re going to address that right out of the box so they don\u2019t leave.", "Now to address your question, we are calling these net operational synergies because we do believe it takes into account what we might see in the way of disruption. But it\u2019s our estimate and we frankly hope that we\u2019re going to be wrong and it\u2019s going to be better than that.", "Edward Kelly", "Okay. Good. Thank you. And then my just one follow-up question here. You\u2019re growing gross profit dollar per case. Again, this is I think the fourth quarter now that we\u2019ve seen it. So it obviously speaks positively about the business, speaks positively about the industry. But I was curious about is how much of it is sort of internal initiatives, things like category management versus just a better industry outlook as well? I was wondering if you could maybe help parse that out for us.", "Bill DeLaney", "Great question, hard to answer, Ed. I think we\u2019re hopeful on the -- some of this positive consumer sentiment that\u2019s been out there for a while begins to get to our customer base and that will translate into more industry growth.", "Our quarterly numbers as you track them, you see they have been float around between 2% and 3% here over the last few quarters. We do have a positive growth for the locally managed customers now, which we didn\u2019t have a year ago. So that\u2019s a big part of it which coming back to mix and the different way customer mix.", "We\u2019ve spent, as you can appreciate, a lot of time and effort over the last 15 months with best practices and how to manage margin better and still effectively deliver customers need in terms of offerings. But clearly the category management is driving a fair amount of it right now. And we\u2019re doing a better job of integrating it as I said in my prepared comments into the everyday business activities. So I would say that\u2019s a large part of it.", "Edward Kelly", "Great. Thank you.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Moving on to Vinnie Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.", "Vinnie Sinisi", "Hey, great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you guys about the ERP rollout. It seems like parts of it are going to continue to move forward here. I know on the past you\u2019ve said that with the merger pending that you are kind of taking a bit of a step back on some of those processes. So can you just kind of recap for us all in terms of -- is this now going to really restart here or are some parts of it or which parts of it will still be waiting on the outcome of the merger?", "Bill DeLaney", "Good morning. I think it\u2019s more of what we talked about over the last couple quarters in terms of, we are not doing new deployments right now until we have a better sense for where the merger is going to play out and when and some of the geographic issues that will come with that.", "But what we\u2019ve been able to do and we did -- when we talked about in the last earnings call, we\u2019ve been able to go in and put in some significant enhancements into the software that are now being utilized by the 12 OpCos that are on and the core SAP software platforms.", "And the other thing we are doing more of, which we spoke to here today, is taking some of the other applications, whether they\u2019re financial or HR, maintenance that type of thing, even for the SA -- even for the non-SAP OpCos bring those into SPS, accelerating network to where SPS is now, supporting in certain areas, not just the 12 OpCos that run SAP, but these are the functional support software packages as well.", "So to summarize, I think it\u2019s a combination that we\u2019re continuing to enhance the support around and the software that the 12 OpCos are using as well as beginning to leverage SPS in a different way and as I said. So, A, we\u2019re providing better services to the 12 OpCos today, but also when we do begin to redeploy again, those future conversions can go more, more smoothly. And then we\u2019re still -- we\u2019re going to defer any further deployments until we understand the timing of the merger a little bit better.", "Vinnie Sinisi", "Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up. Going back to the 11 facilities that were called out today, any further color that you guys can give in terms of perceived market share or the competitive stands in those areas? And then also just as a matter of process, I just want to make sure that I'm correct here. When dealing with the FTC, so those 11, the proposal of those 11 facilities you kind of have already gone to the first level of discussions. And now it\u2019s in a sense being escalated to the five commissioners. I just want to make sure that that is correct.", "Bill DeLaney", "Yes. So let me be clear or try to be clear. We\u2019ve had multiple discussions over multiple months with the FTC. And we are trying to the best of our ability to understand not just the nature of their concerns and the depth of their concerns and the breadth of their concerns, but also how we think we can remedy those concerns based upon our knowledge of this industry, based upon our knowledge of how to shift groceries to customers and our knowledge of competitive positioning.", "So this package is a package that we have developed that we believe addresses their concern. We have received no approval from the FTC at any level in this package.", "Vinnie Sinisi", "Okay. And then just, I guess maybe you can say so much at this point, but any further color on the specific markets where these 11 are located?", "Chris Kreidler", "No, we\u2019re really not going to get into the talking about market share and the individual markets.", "Vinnie Sinisi", "Okay. Now totally understandable. All right. Great. Thanks very much. Good luck going forward.", "Bill DeLaney", "Thank you.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We move on to Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Ajay Jain", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess Bill, based on your prepared comments on the merger and the objections by the FTC staff. I'm just wondering if your announcement with Performance Food could really set the stage for litigation with the FTC.", "So if the process goes in that direction, do you think you can wrap up any potential litigation and complete the merger process? By the time the agreement is set to expire, I think that deadline is in September if I'm not mistaken. So do you feel like you're potentially running out of time to the extent that's an issue at all?", "Bill DeLaney", "So I want to make I am answering this right. We think we have ample time if we do end up in some litigation to work through that and still bring that to some type of closure before the expiration of the merger agreement.", "Ajay Jain", "And just finally on -- as a quick follow-up on the merger-related expenses, can you just quantify little bit better how much you expect that to moderate in the back half of the year?", "Chris Kreidler", "I would love to be able to have a forecast for merger-related expenses and certain of those line items. I can do that. I can say these consultants were, we don\u2019t need them anymore and these consultants we still do. But a lot of just depends on what we\u2019re doing in the fourth quarter -- in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the year. So it is rather difficult to estimate those expenses on a go forward basis.", "So I mean to say they\u2019re moderating, they\u2019re certainly not going to go to zero. There is work that we are going to continue to do to prepare, but we\u2019re certainly looking to stand down any teams that have completed their work. So that we can reduce those expenses and we look at that literally every month to decide how many consultants we need here supporting us. But it\u2019s too hard to call frankly where we\u2019re going to be in the process and what work needs to be done.", "Ajay Jain", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question will come from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe", "Hi. Great. Just really quickly from me at this point. The overall trend of inflation kind of going forward, calendar \u201915 and if not calendar \u201915 at least, back half of your fiscal \u201915 and just in terms of, where you see it trending and from a gross profit per case perspective it was potentially kind of getting back into a place where passing out pricing can be easier to the customer in relation to a previous question? Thanks.", "Chris Kreidler", "I don\u2019t think we are there yet, John. I do think we are beginning to see some subsiding in the trajectory of the inflationary rate. So, hopefully, we have peaked here at the 6%. It\u2019s still early this quarter. The individual categories are moving around. Right now, the bulk of the inflations we see here today is more in the meat side and dairy beginning to level out.", "So we don\u2019t make predictions or give guidance. But I -- you really asked two questions. I think the inflation overtime, over the next six, nine, 12 months, should subside to some degree. I don\u2019t know where it ends up.", "But, hopefully, less than the 5% to 6%, because as we always said that\u2019s not good for our customers and that\u2019s why sometimes it\u2019s a -- actually most of time, is how to pass those along as fast as you would like. So I think we are seeing a little early, but too early to call until get into March and April, and we kind of back into the heavier volume months.", "John Ivankoe", "Thank you.", "Bill DeLaney", "Welcome.", "Operator", "We will move on to Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.", "Kelly Bania", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just another one related to the merger. Just based on your discussions with FTC over the last year and what their concerns are? I am just curious how you would characterize what you perceive is the likelihood that the FTC will accept this proposal as a remedy. I mean, does this address all of their concerns in your point of view?", "Bill DeLaney", "I appreciate the question. I don\u2019t think I am in a position to really address the likelihood. There maybe other people out there that can give you a better handle on that. I would just continue to say that we believe strongly in this merger. We believe it\u2019s pro-competitive in what\u2019s already and incredibly competitive industry. We believe it\u2019s good for our customers. Clearly, there will be some disruption.", "So I am sure there has been some concerns convey to the FTC and to us from that standpoint. But that\u2019s not unusual mergers. We spend a year and tens of millions of dollars preparing integration plan to mitigate as much disruption as possible and we think over the medium-term to longer term.", "This is very good for our customer base. This is going to be for our shareholders. We think it will actually raise the bar for competition in our industry, which long-term is good for everybody in our industry. So we believe strongly in our case and that\u2019s probably all I can should and can comment on.", "Kelly Bania", "Okay. And then, just maybe another follow-up, how were these 11 DC selected, just give us some quick math, I think, you still have about 80 DCs and these look even like they are either larger or more highly productive than the average? Just any comments there would be helpful.", "Bill DeLaney", "Yeah. I am going to start and Chris can give you probably little more, essentially, I think, you can see as if you put together all the color we are trying to provide today. We try to put together footprint that would address, the Western part of United States in a way that we complement the current footprint FTC has, which is across the country, but it\u2019s a little less dense in the West compared to U.S. So what you are seeing there primarily is an attempt both with large and medium sized facilities to address that.", "Kelly Bania", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thank you.", "Bill DeLaney", "Welcome.", "Operator", "We will move on to Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Hi. Good morning. So, one of the challenges on the divestitures, is there anyway to guarantee that the customers really follow the facility divestitures? And I wonder if there is anyway you could give us from a big picture standpoint, what the market share on the national accounts look like before and after the divestiture?", "Bill DeLaney", "Well, there is no way to guarantee. But, again, we have done a lot of work on the integration planning and working through this TSA agreement with PFG to address that and Chris has been leading that work. So I\u2019ll let him take that.", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah. I mean, one other things, as I said in our integration planning, one of our primary principals was the least amount of disruption to our customers, US Foods customer. We took the same approach in our discussions with PFG and obviously, they care a lot about that as well and so we\u2019ve structured it in a way that we believe it\u2019s going to be least disruptive to those customers.", "So if you think about our customer that\u2019s being serviced out of the call it Denver facility for US Foods today, that same sales person or the same trucks, food coming out of that same facility is going to go to that customer ones it is owned by PFG.", "So we believe that\u2019s the least amount of disruption to the customer and as long as they continue to get good service at fair prices and value, we don\u2019t believe there is a reason for them to want a change. So I\u2019m agree with Bill, there is no guarantee, but I believe we except this stuff in a way that\u2019s the customers will continue to get good service and good value going forward.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Are there long-term contracts that transfer and is there a non-compete agreement or anything like that on going after this customers?", "Chris Kreidler", "Yeah. There is a lot of things that will be contained in the 8-K, which we will file later this week. So I\u2019d encourage you to look into that. There is an enough in there, I think, keep you busy for awhile. But as you might imagine we intend to and FTC, of course, would want us to set PFG up for success here and again, and do it in a way that our customers don\u2019t feel or experience that disruption. So everything that\u2019s necessary to make that happen we put into the TSA or the agreement.", "Bill DeLaney", "I think just to illustrate that for maybe -- from a layman standpoint. What Chris and Russell and our teams have done is basically, as you look at, don\u2019t just look at this facilities, from a customers perspective, they are going to be position at the same sales persons, same driver, the same customer service team in this TSA agreement, which you can look at, once we get it out in the K -- 8-K. We have taken a lot of measures to position PFG to be successful as they transition that business. So we have done a lot of things to position them for success early days here.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Okay. And I know you\u2019ve address this, the $600 million synergy number, but you stand back and look at the deal from a broad perspective, US Foods have lost earnings power, while it\u2019s been waiting for the transaction to close. If you look at where they are today, add in the synergies, where do you think you will be on EPS accretion by year four or five?", "Bill DeLaney", "We have not given and I\u2019m probably not going to today give any kind of forecast for earnings accretion. We obviously have re-looked at the transaction based upon everything that\u2019s happened over the year and based upon this divestiture package and we still feel this is a very nice return for Sysco and our shareholders.", "We have got to, obviously, get the deal close and then we have got to work on executing against the synergies and we now also and will be a little more, add a little more complexity, we also need to work on the divestiture package and make sure that that set up alright. As long as we continue to service the customers ours and US Foods, we get a very nice return out of the transaction and that\u2019s where we are focused on.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Chris Kreidler", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions. At this time that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a good day.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Sysco reported third quarter fiscal 2015 financial results. Sales increased 4% to $11.7 billion. Adjusted operating income decreased 3% to $377 million, adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $238 million and EPS increased 5% to $0.40 for the quarter. Net earnings and EPS for the quarter were in line with our expectations, as solid volume and gross profit dollar growth along with a favorable tax rate offset the impact of moderating inflation trends on favorable foreign exchange translation and higher than planned operating expenses.", "Case volume grew 2.5% for the quarter and we were pleased with our growth both with locally managed and corporate managed customers. Overall, weather was not a major factor in our year-over-year comparisons for the quarter as we benefited from favorable comparisons in January and February, but were hampered by severe weather in the Northeast and Mideast in late February and most of March. This last point is important to note, because March provides a disproportionately large portion of our third quarter volume and was a relatively mild weather month last year. We experienced similar trends in April, but expect the year-over-year monthly impact of weather will dissipate as we move into May and June.", "We continue to roll out and successfully execute our category management initiative and the benefits from this process contributed to our gross profit dollar growth during the quarter. Through category management, we were able to support our customer's growth by lowering our product cost and developing innovative product development ideas. This is vital to mitigating gross margin pressure as we move forward in what remains a fiercely competitive market environment.", "Regarding expense management, we established appropriately aggressive goals for cost per case management for fiscal 2015, after a very strong expense management performance in the prior year. We experienced modest improvement in sequential trends in the third quarter, but will fall short of our original goals in this area for the year. With that said, our entire leadership team in intently focused on enhancing productivity in a sustainable manner while delivering exceptional service to our customers. I expect our performance trends in this area to improve modestly in the fourth quarter and more so in fiscal 2016.", "Moving to our multi-year business transformation initiatives, we are pleased with the progress we've made on achieving the steady state cost saving goals we set as we began fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2015 is the third year of that financial roadmap and we have already exceeded our original target of $600 million, which was comprised of approximately $300 million in annual savings in both operating and product costs. While pleased with this progress we've made over the past three years \u2013 on these initiatives, it is more clear than ever that transforming Sysco's business will be a perpetual process as we strive to fully realize our vision of being our customer's most valued and trusted business partner.", "Foundational to our ultimate success is further developing and continually enhancing our technology platform. We have now embedded this work in the overall scope of our Business Technology group under the leadership of Wayne Shurts. We have learned a great deal from the challenges we encountered in deploying SAP and all of the standardized processes it requires.", "Over the past two years under Wayne's leadership, we have refined our business processes, strengthened our technology support capabilities, stabilized the SAP system and enhanced its efficiency. While there is more work to be done, we are well-positioned to move forward with a cohesive enterprise-wide module centered approach rather than our previous OpCo-by-OpCo multi-module approach. As our deployment process matures and evolves in the future, we expect this change to result in smoother conversions, better execution and an improved experience for our customers.", "On the acquisition front, we recently completed our previously announced agreement to acquire 50% of Pacific Star Foodservice, a leading food service distributor in Mexico. We have developed a strong relationship over the past several years with the ownership and management team of Pacific Star and we are very excited about the potential opportunities that this partnership will provide to profitably grow our business in Mexico.", "Regarding our pending merger with US Foods, the hearing related to the FTC's motion for preliminary injunction begins tomorrow, May 5, and will last up to seven business days. If we receive a ruling in our favor, we will proceed to closing unless the decision is appealed. In the event of an unfavorable ruling, we would assess together with US Foods' ownership whether to pursue the case further. We remain resolute in our belief that this transaction is pro-competitive, good for our customers and will accelerate Sysco's business transformation.", "We announced in April that Joel Grade has been named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective September 1, 2015, following Chris Kreidler's decision to leave the company. Joel is a veteran Sysco leader with nearly 20 years of experience in key finance and commercial roles. He is uniquely suited to step into the CFO position because of his deep knowledge of our local operations and people. We are fortunate to have a leader like Joel ready to take on this key position and I look forward to working closely with him in his new role as we move forward. We appreciate the numerous important contributions Chris has made on Sysco's behalf since joining us five years ago. He has agreed to remain as CFO through August and he will work closely with Joel and Sysco's senior executive team to ensure an orderly transition of his responsibilities, including staying on through the end of December as an advisor.", "In closing, I am pleased with the consistent case growth we've seen in our locally-managed and corporate managed business, which demonstrates our associates' unwavering focus on providing consistent and excellent service to our customers. In addition, our leadership team is making good progress in driving out initiatives to enhance both gross profit dollar growth and expense management. Our ongoing work to fundamentally reshape our company is challenging but gratifying and we strongly believe that the steps we are taking will reinforce our leadership position in the ever evolving food service industry.", "Now, I'll turn things over to Chris so that he can provide additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, sales were $11.7 billion, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. Our sales growth rate was substantially lower than the 7% rate we saw during the first half of the fiscal year because of the rapid decline in food cost inflation and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Food cost inflation declined significantly from 6% in the second quarter to 3.7% in the third quarter. Our estimate for food cost inflation represents the weighted average change in Sysco's cost of the same products year-over-year. At 3.7%, it would appear we are getting close to what we normally describe as the sweet spot for inflation of 2% to 3%. But the 3.7% is an average across all of our product lines and sometimes averages don't tell the whole story as is the case here.", "Specifically, the meat category experienced low double-digit inflation in the quarter and poultry inflation was in the high single digits. On a weighted average basis, these two categories accounted for 3.2% of the 3.7% of inflation we experienced across all of our categories. At these levels, passing along all of the inflation can be painful to our customers, putting gross margin under pressure. In addition, rapid declines in food cost also make it challenging to leverage our fixed costs.", "The impact of changes in foreign exchange rate had a much larger impact than usual this quarter. Similar to many companies with significant operations outside of the U.S., the strengthening dollar depressed our foreign sales as we converted them to U.S. dollars. This quarter's decrease of 1.3% was the highest in the past three years. The impact has typically been in the range of zero to 0.5%. Sales from acquisitions increased sales by 0.6%. Case volume grew 2.5% during the quarter, including acquisitions, and approximately 2.2% excluding acquisitions. Gross profit in the third quarter was $2.1 billion, a 3.1% increase, while gross margin declined 17 basis points to 17.52%.", "Benefits from category management contributed significantly to our gross profit during the quarter. In addition, case volume growth for our locally managed Broadline business continued to increase slightly on a sequential basis as it is done the last two quarters.", "Solid local case growth is important to drive gross profit dollar growth. Case growth for our corporate managed customers remains strong, but competitive pricing pressure in this segment contributed to gross margin pressure. Certain items for the third quarter totaled $91 million and related to merger and integration planning expenses and interest on the merger debt. Of this amount, $50 million was recorded in operating expense and $41 million was recorded in interest expense.", "Merger and integration planning costs that impacted operating expenses were mainly related to work to prepare for the integration of the two companies' technology platforms. These expenses in total were lower in the third quarter compared to levels in the first half of the year, as we scaled back our integration planning work in certain areas where a significant amount of work has already been completed. Merger costs that impacted interest expense relate to the debt that we issued last October that is intended to refinance US Foods' debt upon closing of the transaction. We are treating this interest expense as a certain item until the merger closes.", "Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter increased $73 million, or 4.5%, due to a $61 million increase in payroll expense. Payroll expense increased mainly due to higher pay for our sales organization as a result of higher gross profit, investments in new administrative support capabilities, higher incentive accruals and newly acquired operations. These increases were partially offset by lower delivery costs, mainly driven by savings in fuel expense. After excluding incentives, adjusted operating expenses would have increased 3.9%.", "Our cost per case performance improved modestly from earlier in the year, but, as Bill mentioned, expense management remains a challenge for us. Adjusted cost per case performance for the third quarter in the North American Broadline business, which is the portion of the business we have given guidance on previously, increased only $0.03 in the third quarter. However, excluding the benefit from currency translation, cost per case would have increased by $0.09.", "We have previously said we expect cost per case to increase between $0.05 and $0.10 this year. We would expect to be in the low end of this range, including the impact of foreign exchange, and on the high end of this range, excluding foreign exchange. We are focused on driving improvement across our operations with multiple initiatives that implement best practices, enhance our operating training programs and improve our ability to measure and analyze our performance. Adjusted operating income from the quarter was $377 million, down 2.7% from the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 3.2%, down 23 basis points from last year.", "Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34%, compared to 39% in the prior year period. This quarter's rate was positively impacted by the favorable resolution of a state tax matter. In the prior year, the rate was elevated due to the non-deductible portion of a $20 million legal settlement that we disclosed at the time. Normalizing for these types of discrete events, our tax rate would be roughly 37%. This is lower than our historical rates due to the increasing amount of business earnings in international jurisdictions that have lower tax rates, as well as reduced state taxes from legal restructurings. Adjusted net earnings increased 7% to $238 million and adjusted EPS increased 5.3% to $0.40.", "Cash flow performance in the first 39 weeks of the year was relatively strong after taking into account the cash impact of certain items. Cash flow from operations increased $12 million to $860 million versus last year. This increase reflects the negative impact of two items. First, the cash impact of certain items increased $82 million year-over-year, mainly due to merger and integration planning expenses. Second, as we disclosed earlier this year, we made a $50 million pension contribution this year compared to none in the prior year period. This difference is simply driven by different timing regarding when we make cash contributions each year.", "Cash tax payments were $135 million lower than last year, due to a lower effective tax rate, which I discussed a moment ago, and merger and integration planning expenses that reduced taxable earnings. Free cash flow was $439 million in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015, compared to $484 million in the prior year period, or a reduction of $46 million. However, after adjusting for the cash impact of certain items and the increase in pension contribution I mentioned a moment ago, free cash flow was $617 million, an increase of $86 million or 16% from the prior year period.", "Capital expenditures for the first 39 weeks of the year, net of proceeds from sales of assets, increased $58 million to $422 million. About $53 million of this increase is due to IT-related merger integration planning and the rest was due to timing of investment in our fleet.", "Our cash flow from operations and free cash flow are always impacted by foreign currency translation, but the impact for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2015 is much greater than the last few years. You will see in the cash flow statement a $77 million impact this year compared to less than $0.5 million last year. This means our cash flows would have been $77 million higher on a constant dollar basis.", "Turning to an update on recent acquisitions, last month we completed the previously announced transaction to buy 50% of Pacific Star Foodservice, a leading foodservice distributor in Mexico. Pacific Star has operated since 1989 with distribution centers servicing customers in the major metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Tijuana. It primarily services chain accounts, including fast food and casual dining restaurants, casinos, theme parks, movie theaters and hotels throughout Mexico. This partnership fits our international expansion strategy, allows us to enhance service to our U.S. customers who operate in the region, and provides growth opportunities in an important region of the Americas.", "In addition, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced our agreement to acquire Tannis Trading in Canada. Tannis operates in the Ottawa market, the fourth largest in Canada. This acquisition, which remains subject to regulatory approval, will allow us to better serve our customers and achieve our goal of increasing sales in Canada.", "Regarding our outlook for the remainder of the year, there are a few additional items I'd like to point out. First, as we discussed last quarter, because of the pending merger during this fiscal year, we have not been in the market buying back shares to offset dilution from incentive-based compensation as we would normally be doing. This has had the effect of increasing our shares outstanding in the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year due to the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units. As a result, both adjusted and reported diluted EPS were lower by half a penny in the third quarter and a penny and a half over the first 39 weeks. Unless we repurchase shares during the fourth quarter, we estimate that our diluted shares outstanding may be greater than 597 million shares for the fiscal year. This estimate is dependent on the level of stock options exercises and RSU vesting that occurs, and does not include the impact of the shares to be issued in conjunction with the pending US Foods merger.", "Second, please note that we plan to pay off $300 million in bonds that come due in mid-June. We currently anticipate using cash on hand to fund this payment.", "Lastly, our forecast for capital expenditures, net of proceeds from asset sales, remains at $500 million to $500 million \u2013 sorry, $500 million to $550 million for fiscal 2015. But we now expect to be at the high end of this range for the year.", "In closing, while our top-line has been negatively impacted by lower levels of inflation and a larger impact from foreign currency translations, we are pleased that the business continues to generate solid case volume growth, in particular, in the locally-managed portion of our business. We have opportunities to improve our operating expense management and have begun to make some progress in this area. But importantly, the business continues to generate strong free cash flow. While we have work ahead of us to transform the business, there are many exciting initiatives underway that will enhance our customer's experience, strengthen our operating performance and increase profitability.", "With that, operator, we'll now take some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And we'll take our first question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.", "John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hello. Bill, actually a tactical question and then a strategic one. So, Bill, on the tactical side, it would seem that inflation probably moderates a bit further from here. Can you offset that with cost reduction, or is the uncertainty around US Foods and kind of where the business sits today, hamstringing you from doing that? And then I have a strategic one.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "John, we have to. I mean, so yeah, do I think we can? In the past, we've been able to adjust our expenses accordingly and I agree with your premise. I think you can see the inflation come down a little bit more just for the reasons, Chris said, we've got a couple of categories that are pretty high and the others \u2013 dairy's very volatile, as you know, so dairy is down a little bit. Seafood is down a little bit but seafood is not a big part of the overall mix. So, I think essentially you're looking at an environment today where you've got two categories, meat and poultry, that are high, which is difficult to pass along in a fast way and the right way, and the others are pretty much neutral, if you put them all together. And yeah, I expect that to continue here at least for the \u2013 whatever; a few \u2013 couple or three months as far as we can see out.", "As I said in my comments, we are seeing improvement on the expenses sequentially, we're just not seeing it as fast as we had planned and I think you will see more expense improvement here in the fourth quarter relative to the first part of the year and we're certainly planning to do even more for next year.", "John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And then, strategically, I know you don't have a lot to talk about this, but have you done much planning if US Foods doesn't happen? And what would you do differently than you're doing today if that doesn't come to fruition?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, first of all, one of the things I feel really good about is we have done a nice job here. We spent some money doing it separating, running the business day-to-day and keeping our people \u2013 the vast majority of our people focused on taking care of their customers and running their business and not having them be distracted by the merger. And then we had another group of people and outside support folks who have done a great job under Chris's and Greg Bertrand's leadership driving out a very sound integration plan. So I feel good about what we've done to date. Yes, we have done some contingent planning and it's not fully developed. We have had discussions as a management team and with our board and we will continue to have those discussions and once we have a ruling, then we'll probably take some more time but not a lot of time and go forth from there with some other strategic directions. So yes, we've done some planning, but not in a position today to really talk a whole lot about that.", "John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "All right, thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Karen Short with Deutsche Bank. And Karen Short, your line is now open. Please check your mute function. And we'll move on to Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. I just have a follow-up to John's question here. Bill, in the past, you guys have mentioned international M&A as an area of interest. I mean, obviously, the U.S. market is top of mind right now. But if material consolidation is not possible here, where are your heads today on international relative to where they were in the past? Is it still something that you would be interested in?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Certainly. As you heard, we are pleased with the joint venture that we just finalized with our partners down in Mexico and we have gradually built out some small footprint in Costa Rica and now Mexico, Bahamas, Ireland, Canada was the first one, obviously. So, I think where we are there, Ed, is I think it's just a matter of pace of place. So we definitely, when we talk about the strategy of the company, that fifth point we talk about is always looking for other areas to expand, whether it be through adjacencies or geographics. And I just see it more as something we need to do continually, and over the next three years to five years, I would like to think we'll continue to find good partners in different parts of the world where our customers value our capabilities and find ways to grow there primarily to lay a foundation for the future beyond that.", "So I see international more as something we need to do. We need to continually build it for the medium to long-term. Short to medium-term, obviously, US Foods is a big, big part of our strategy. It's not our strategy. It's a big part of our strategy. If that were not to work out, we would revisit other strategic opportunities that we looked at in the past and look at our capital structure and all those types of things. I'm just not in a position today to talk a whole lot about it.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "And, Bill, when you think about the U.S. business now, there is obviously always puts and takes on what impacts the earnings. I mean, the backdrop doesn't really seem to be too bad right now with what's going on with restaurant sales and lower fuel. But this quarter, you're back to EBITDA actually being down a little bit year-over-year to a couple of quarters of good growth, and I guess the question is, what is it really saying about the outlook for the business, I guess, absent a deal? And you touched on a little bit, but is there a need for some larger strategic refresh or restructuring if the transaction were not to happen, or are you really just \u2013 is it more really more about fine-tuning?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think both, all right? So we need to manage what we have the ability to control the most, which is our business. And we're pretty at running our business. Obviously, as we've said for a while now, the market environment we are in, it's difficult. It's very competitive and it's not unlike many other industries and we don't expect that to change. So again, to kind of recap how we look at the world, we see modest medium to long-term growth in the industry. We expect to grow faster than that. To do that, we need to differentiate ourselves ongoingly with our customers and we need to take costs out of the system. That's one of the reasons why this merger is so important to us. If the merger doesn't happen, we'll need to find other ways to continue to do that. We may not get there quite as fast, but I'm confident we'll continue to go in the right direction.", "Specifically to this quarter, you can look at in a lot of different ways. The bottom line is we didn't manage our expenses as well as we would have liked. If we had managed our cost piece maybe just a nickel better, I think you would have seen a different result here and I would have been \u2013 I wouldn't have talked as much about planned expenses. So we're going to have quarters where there is inflation and less inflation. And we had good volume growth. As I've said, we managed gross profit reasonably well, given the environment. We just didn't bring our expenses in line as fast as we planned and I expect it will get better with that here over the next two years to three quarters.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thank you and good luck with US Foods.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Karen Short with Deutsche Bank.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Sorry about that before. Just guess curious, I mean, I know we've talked a lot about the expense issue and I guess I'm still confused as to why it's been a problem for two quarters in a row. I mean, I know you pointed to some things in terms of comps that affected expenses, but anything else you can kind of put some color on?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll do my best, Karen. I would say this quarter was a little different in that our selling expense was higher than where it was the first half of the year. We were up a couple pennies the first half of the year in selling and that was fine. We had a lot of gross profit dollar growth and that's going to drive selling expense. So, this quarter was up more than that. It's still probably fine but it just can't be sustained. I mean, it's just we just a situation where seasonally it's a low volume quarter. It's also a time that we bring MAs on in terms of training, and we had some operating companies that were behind in their head count and I think that put some pressure on us here as well.", "So, selling costs is a little higher than what we planned. On the operation side, we're making progress. We're driving out a lot of change there, Karen, and we've been driving out very aggressively over the last year to two years. And that puts a lot of stress on the operating companies at a time when they still need to provide really solid service to our customers. And so there's been some challenges in terms of how fast you can drive that change and how well it's received by our workforce and how well our leadership, including me, are able to drive that out. So, what we're doing here is transforming a company and we're bringing more standardization to our best practices in the field. We're functionalizing that part of our business in terms of the OpCo and our end-to-end supply chain organization now, and it's just taken a little longer to get where we want to go. The good news is we are seeing sequential relative improvement and that's what gives me some confidence here.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Karen, this is Chris. I'll jump in and just elaborate on one point Bill made. Remember, a couple years ago, we talked quite a bit about some of the changes we made in our sales organization, and we saw that disruption. We saw that disruption and slowed growth in terms of case volume on the local side especially and we talked quite a bit about it at the time. We pushed through a lot of change and it took a while for all that change to kind of be accepted and understood and appropriately reacted to in the field.", "I think what you're seeing now is somewhat similar going on, on the operating expense environment. We are, as Bill said, pushing out a lot of change. It's for the good. It's going to lead to better results in the future, but it's going to take a while for some of that change to actually drive all the way down to the operating company level. And I think that's part of what we're experiencing right now. Not an excuse. We need to manage it better, but I do think we're seeing some of that.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, I mean, to your point on MAs and progress on the top-line, I guess independent sales definitely seemed fairly strong, although SYGMA was weak. But anything to point to on what was driving the strength in independent?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think that's the good news. I mean, when we talk about initiatives, they're not all about cost savings. And I think what you're seeing there is some \u2013 several things that we've done over the last two years or three years, starting with the CRM tool, category management. We're getting better executing that; some basic things we're doing in terms of working with our MAs and training and how to segment more effectively our customers and product categories. And just creating more continuity, if you will, between the corporate sales organization and the field sales organization, as well as the OpCos overall. So we're pleased both on the local side and the corporate side. If you go back four quarters or five quarters, we had no growth on the local side. So, I think that's a bright spot and that's certainly something we've emphasized and something we need to continue to emphasize.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then, just last question on the expense side. What's driving the merger and integration increase? Because I guess I was under the impression that you had kind of completed all you could from a merger and integration expense perspective until you know more \u2013 or until, hopefully, you close the merger, and it still seemed to be-I mean, it's still increasing.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, it's actually not increasing on a sequential basis. It's starting to decline. We hit our peak last quarter, Karen, and it's coming down from there. But I'll take your question to where I think you want to go, anyway, why is it not perhaps dropping faster? There are a couple reasons.", "I mean, the interest portion of that, obviously, is not going to go anywhere, but even on the operating expense portion, there is a lot of work that continues to be done to prepare the two IT systems to be able to merge. We're not touching the US Foods system or vice versa, but we're creating the conduits that will be necessary to allow them to merge. Unfortunately, as this deal has drug out, we were able to stand down certain aspects of what we were doing from a planning perspective because we can stand them back up rather quickly; but a lot of other areas, we need all the time we could possibly get to be prepared for merging and integrating, and we continued some of that work. So it's come down somewhat. I expect it to not increase again, of course, until we complete the transaction; and, of course, we'll give you new guidance.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about cash. I spent many years in fixed income land and cash is cash. You can't really define it. And it just looks to me like, in fact, you're not covering your dividend, or didn't for the first nine months of the year. And then \u2013 so I'm wondering, you have a $300 million payment you're going to make this year. Could you talk about: are you going to borrow? Do you have a revolving credit facility that you're going to borrow under?", "And sort of the same thing holds true if the deal does not go through, you probably will have your bonds will be put back to you, the $5 billion, but you're not sitting on that much cash. So what do you think happens? How do you fund that put if it happens?", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Let me take the two pieces of that, Meredith. First, the $300 million, as I mentioned, we will pay that out of the cash that we have sitting on the balance sheet, which is just shy of $5 billion. That's what we'll do, initially. If we then repay the bonds, because you correctly point out if the merger agreement terminates there's a process for those to be redeemed, we would pay those back out. Whatever we can't pay out of cash, we would put into our credit facility. We do have a very large commercial paper line backstopped by a credit facility, about a $1.5 billion. So we have got plenty of capacity to put on the balance sheet.", "We would then look at whether we have enough capacity for just general working capital needs and we'd look at whether we need to term out some of the debt that we've taken on the balance sheet the last couple of years, the acquisitions we've done, et cetera. We would do that after that point in time when things settle out.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then, just have one other question. You said that...", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Meredith, do you mind if I just jump in still? Just on the cash point, I was just going back to the earlier questions we had. First of all, we're going to cover our dividend here. If you adjust for the merger related expenses and things like that, we're going to more than cover our dividend from free cash flow this year.", "Second of all, the way I look at cash is, strategically, we include debt capacity. So obviously, as you well know, we're very highly rated company from a debt perspective. We have plenty of debt capacity and certainly want to utilize it prudently, but I'm very confident in our ability to fund whatever we need to fund.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I'm not actually worried about liquidity. You're not going to run out of liquidity. My next question, just quickly, is about category management and cycling the improvements you've seen so far. I think that we'll cycle some in this next quarter, but it sounded like you had more coming. How do you think that balances out in terms of the benefit to the gross margin?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you're right. We're finishing up the third year and we said from the beginning category management would be somewhat backend loaded, and we've seen those benefits this year. I think the key that \u2013 the way to look at that, Meredith, is just we are now maturing to a point where, well, we speak about category management, it truly is embedded in how we merchandise and we have centralized merchandising here to a large extent. We certainly have standardized all of it. We still do some locally in terms of working with suppliers, but, for the most part, we're working with the suppliers here at corporate and then working closely with our operating companies.", "So from that standpoint, we've realized a lot of benefits, but we have some more launches here to do later this year and into next year; not a significant part of the overall volume. And then, I think what you'll see us do is we'll get into renewals and we'll continue to perfect what we started here and get better at it, and probably have more time to focus on the innovation side of it, which is critical, obviously, to growing the business as well.", "So, I look at it as something which we would continue to get better at, which would continue to help us mitigate the overall margin pressure that we face in the business itself, but something that we feel really good about at this point.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And let's take our next question from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Hi. Good morning. Bill, I wanted to ask you about the sales trend during the quarter into April, and \u2013 it was pretty abrupt from quite strong to kind of weak. And I didn't see Sysco's numbers, but for the industry. It sounds like you guys outperformed that, but what do you think is going on with the industry? I mean, you kind of alluded to weather, because last year was easy and this March was tough. What do you think is going on in April? And I mean, do you have some insight into things maybe stabilizing or turning back up here in the later part of April or early May?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Andy, if you notice, I really didn't talk a lot about the industry or the market because it's hard to make that call right now. While I did talk about weather, I didn't whine about weather this year. So I feel good about that. What we saw was this, and what I alluded to in my comments, we had \u2013 last year, if you go back and look at the weather, it was pretty harsh in December, January and the first three weeks in February and it was harsh in areas where typically you don't see it: Charlotte, Dallas, Atlanta and other places. And so we had some favorable comparisons in late December, January and February. Unfortunately, January and February are not exactly big months for us.", "Then, if you recall last year, there was a little bit of a cabin fever impact up north and I think people got out in March just because they needed to get out and then March was reasonably mild and so was April. And so, the camps and the clubs started to open up earlier. So we had good volume in March and April relative to the rest of the year last year and I think we're seeing softer volume this year. What I'm trying to say to you is I think weather is impacting that. I just don't know to what degree and I think I can make a better call on that after we see May and June here because we'll be back to apples-to-apples.", "In terms of what I read and what I hear, it's probably not a whole lot different than you. The good news here is the consumer sentiment is positive. It's up and down a little bit, but it's still positive. The sentiment of our restaurant operators is positive and it's remained positive. So I think people are generally seeing \u2013 at least maintaining \u2013 they're seeing good things and they're hopeful that it'll translate into better things. Probably the biggest positive out there right now, I would say, would be the lower fuel prices. They've come back up a little bit, but all-in-all, the consumer is getting a raise, if you will, at the pump. What's not clear there at all is to what degree. It appears that the consumer is paying down debt with some of that, saving some of that and spending some of that. It's not clear how much of that we are getting, perhaps some, but I don't think a lot at this point.", "With that said, I think to the extent that the fuel prices stay down for an extended period of time, that will be good for our customers and I would expect that that would help us over time. So it's a long way of saying it; it's hard for me to really explain what's going on in the market right now because of kind of the unusual weather comparisons as well as the impact of fuel, but I think we'll have a better read on this as we get into the summer.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. No, I was looking for more color. But I just want to clarify with following up just on what you're saying. In your preamble, you said you expect things to get better. It sounds like it's more of a macro view of the business rather than something you've seen in the last week or two as a trend that has turned up.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I expect the macro to clear up is what I try to say. I wish I could give you more. In terms of our performance, what I alluded to in my comments was March was softer and April softer. But again, I do think some of that is the comparisons. We'll see. So let's summarize here. You've got moderate inflation, you've got some FX, but let's put that to the side. And you've got softer volume in March and April. I would expect it to pick up. I'm still very pleased with what we are doing. We are growing our volume both on the local side and the corporate side. So relative to the market, I'm pleased where we are at there.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "I just wanted to ask Chris a question on the incentive compensation accrual you've called out. It's kind of housekeeping, but it seemed like quite a big number compared to trend and well above what the stock option alone would be. Did I do that math right? And if so, could you give us some explanation of why the accrual was so big?", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I'm not so sure. I can't respond to the last part of \u2013 compared to what you're thinking, but the accrual itself is just what we anticipate paying out on those incentive accruals versus where we are on our objectives and on a year-over-year basis, we're just in a much better place. So last year at this time, we were not hitting our bonusable objectives and so we had very little accrued this year. We are accruing still at target because we are on pace to hit those objectives. So on a year-over-year basis, that's where you get the increase.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. So you're saying it's on trend with prior quarters, there was no catch-up Q3, just your on trend with the bonus accrual?", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Not this year. Yeah, this year, there's been no catch-up from quarter to quarter. No. Last year, it bounced around because every quarter you got to look at where you are versus those objectives and so we went through the first quarter fine. But then we had to start reducing the accruals Q2 and Q3 because we were no longer on track to hit the target.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Fine. So you were just calling out a tough comparison and we can do the adjustment if we like, and it is what it is. Okay.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. That's really all it is. Like say, I normally \u2013 I try to put things on an apples-to-apples basis as much as possible and when I look at our performance this year, especially on operating expenses, I don't like to say, well, we have to compare those incentives versus a year where there were no incentives whatsoever. Now, we still have to pay for those incentives and so those are real dollars and they are really going to go out the door, so we don't try to, again, excuse it, so much as just when you are looking at a percentage increase, I like to try to do apples-to-apples. That's why I gave you the number.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.", "Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks taking my question. I was just curious in the quarter how you think about market share or what your market share may have been and I ask because it looks like some of the broader industry sales trends, at least for the restaurants, it seem very, very strong this quarter. So I was just curious what you would think how you performed relative to the industry during the quarter.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll take that one, Kelly. First of all, we don't track market share quarterly. We look at it annually through different industry sources, primarily technomics and we look at the overall market, U.S. and Canada, and then obviously we look at our numbers and generally if you go back and look over the long-term, Sysco has been able to grow its share about half a point a year and I think we are continuing to do that. I can't really speak to this quarter on market share because I don't have the market data. Certainly, there was some strength in our customer base but not throughout the quarter and certainly not with all customers. So again, I was pleased with how we grew the business, but we don't really track the market share quarterly.", "Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Got it. And then if I could just follow up with one more. Just in light of McDonald's announcement to shift towards using antibiotic-free chicken on their menus, I was just curious how Sysco is maybe positioned in terms of supply of antibiotic-free chicken. Do you see that as an opportunity? What kind of conversations are you having with suppliers and your customers around these products and what could any sales and margin implications for Sysco be if there is a broader shift from your customers to products like this?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I think if I could broaden the question a little bit and not make it about chicken, but just in general, that's one of the key things that we think category management will help us focus on with a brighter light, which is be working with our suppliers and our customers is to better understand what the customers' needs are and how we can, as we optimize our SKUs and strategize together and do a better job of positioning a product in the way that our customers would want to see it whether it's organic or local or whatever it was important to them. So with us, it always starts the way you posed the question, which is what's important to the customer? What does the customer need? And we are doing a lot of work on the customer side through the marketing department, customer loyalty and issues to understand customer needs and then connecting that to the work that we are doing with our suppliers and category management and the data they provide us to better optimize our SKUs.", "Now, it's early days and plenty of work to do there, but it's a big opportunity for us going forward. And I would also say to you, we have over the years made some good progress on the sustainability front and I think you'll see us continue to raise the profile of that work within the company and that group will work very closely with our customers, but also with our merchandising and our marketing team. So bottom line is we do everything we can to understand what the needs of our customers are. I think we are better positioned to do that going forward and I think we can speak more specifically about that as time goes on.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies.", "Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, thank you. Could you just give a little more detail on what we could expect from the court action this week? How long will it take before we hear a decision? And if the court rules for you, is it a foregone conclusion that things will just be approved as stated? Or do you still need to negotiate with the FTC? And if there's a ruling against you, how long does it take to get through the administrative hearing with the FTC?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great questions, Mark. This was new ground for all of us. I would say, as far as the timing, obviously, that's in the hands of the judge in terms of how long the process takes. The hearing starts tomorrow and the judge has given us up to seven days so we'll go through \u2013 it's likely to go through the end of next week. Then there'll be some, as I understand it, some briefs or papers filed by each side with the judge to review. And then, he'll take the time that he needs to come back with a ruling. So we don't know exactly how long that is, but I would think it's closer to weeks than months. But, again, that's his call.", "As far as what happens, as I said in my comments, if we were to prevail, then we think there's a short period of time where the FTC has an opportunity to decide whether they want to appeal or not. And we would wait on that, and then go from there. If they were to prevail, we'll sit down internally and then sit down with the sponsors, the owners of US Foods and charter a course from there as well. So, to be determined, but that's \u2013 those are the different ways it could play out.", "Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And maybe you could talk about the state of US Foods while we're waiting, because we have seen some margin declines in their business through this year, we've been waiting for this deal to close.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I really can't comment much on US Foods. I think it goes without saying that this process is taking longer than we would've liked. And it's probably a little bit harder on them than it has been on us. So, early days, certainly they lost some sales people and I think their sales were hurt. I'm not close enough to it nor should I be in terms of what their margins are right now. And obviously, they pulled back here some on the integration planning over the last couple of months. So we'll \u2013 I think I'll just leave it at that. I probably shouldn't be commenting on US Foods.", "Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And let's take our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks. At this point, just one, I think, easy question for you guys. SYGMA, in general, had a very strong year in fiscal 2014 and has been pretty slow year-over-year to this point in fiscal 2015. Can you shed some light in terms of what's happened there, whether some was by choice, maybe some wasn't by choice? How you feel about the overall growth of that segment over time?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, John. I'll start. I'll let Chris jump in too. I would say it's been a couple of years since SYGMA has had a strong year, and it's got a lot of attention. We have restructured there somewhat and put Greg Keller over SYGMA full-time. And Greg grew up in the SYGMA business. He's been running our national sales area up until the last several months, so he is very well-versed in the SYGMA business. He's very well connected with our customer base. He's got a lot of passion for that business. So, I believe we're in good hands there for leadership.", "There's some things that we're working on there both in terms of how do we better position ourselves in terms of the needs of those customers and still run expenses very tight. So, it's a very transaction service oriented business. Not with a lot of touches like the Broadline, but there's very little margin for error in SYGMA. So, we've had to invest some money over the last year or so in terms of facilities and drivers and people like that and things like that to strengthen the business. And that's hurt us on the bottom line. We've also had to just take a look at how well we're running the business overall.", "So, I'd say, we're in transition with SYGMA. We like the business strategically. It's a very \u2013 that customer base or potential customer base is a big part of the overall opportunity. And it's always nice when you're sitting down with customers or prospective customers for \u2013 to give them a choice in terms of which model they would prefer, the SYGMA model or the Broadline model. And the reality is sometimes they prefer both, depending on their locations and our positions; so, somewhat in transition there, work to do strategically, still very important to the company.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Have you...", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "John?", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yes. Hi.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Just add a couple of other points. As Bill said, it's a business where expense control is incredibly important. It's a low margin business. There have been some regulatory changes on the transportation side, drivers and work rules and things like that, that, while we can handle those fairly well in the Broadline, they affect SYGMA disproportionately. And we're having to overcome some of those things. And as Bill said, we just \u2013 we've got to look at the model and continue to find ways to offset increases like that; so I would echo the statement. It's in transition. We've got some work to do.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Has there been any significant account loss that's maybe been covered up by some account gains? And as you kind of look forward over the next couple of years, do you have any big chain opportunities to add that could be coming up for bid?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think there's any overly significant account losses. SYGMA is no different than the rest of our business. There's a lot of pricing pressure in that business, and so we've had to deal with that as well along the way as we've looked at expenses. But again, Greg is a very strong leader, very strong sales guy. So I'm quite optimistic that we'll continue to find the right mix of customers and do a good job for them. And \u2013 but again, the way we look at SYGMA today is we want to understand what the customer's looking for: what kind of model, what level of support, what economics are they willing to incur. And if that's the SYGMA model, then fine. If it's not, then we'll put them into Broadline. They go back and forth and, as I said, some customers utilize both models. So, I think we're in a good place there in terms of the direction, but from a customer standpoint we look at it across the entire spectrum, which is: what does the customer want in terms of the trade-off of service and price?", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Wanted to just go back to the product for a second. And it sounds like, obviously, early stages, but so far if you've been seeing any incremental demand increases from more of your customers wanting natural organic types of products, would you say that so far you've been able to have access to the supplies? Have you been able to meet demands? And that, now as you're continuing to go through category management, is that something that will continue to evolve? Is that fair to say at this point?", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Vinny. Yeah, that's what I was trying to say. So, yes, we've definitely seen that trend over the last few years. Now, it's a trend. And I have to tell you, in the scheme of what we do, it's not a huge amount of the business, which creates part of the challenge where you need enough volume and you need enough velocity to make it work for the supplier and on the cost side and for the customers. So, I would say it's like a lot of things in Sysco today.", "There's certainly parts of the country and certain OpCos where we do a very good job on the local side and fresh side, and then there's others not so good. And that's where I see the work in merchandizing, and category management, in particular, with innovation getting us in position to be more consistent; and by doing that, create more volume, which will make it more economical. So, the trends have definitely been there. We're responding to them. We just \u2013 we need to continue to get better at it and \u2013 it's a catch-22. We need to continue to grow the volume to make it work for everybody.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Right. That makes sense. Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up. Inflation, that you could see, moderate over the quarter. Was anything kind of internally surprising to you versus your forecast from a particular category specific standpoint? And then, maybe just any additional color with your thoughts on inflation overall as we get through the rest of this year.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah \u2013 surprising. I guess probably it fell off faster than I thought it would from that standpoint. It doesn't surprise me that dairy is down, for example. I mean, dairy is a very volatile category, but the fact that several categories are essentially flat, that's probably a little surprising. And I think as far as the rest of the year, I can't \u2013 if you're going to give me the fiscal year, I could probably look that far ahead. And I think we talked about this with John, earlier. Yeah, I would expect inflation to moderate somewhat more, but I still expect to see some low level of inflation here this quarter.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, Bill, thanks very much. Good luck.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Erin Lash with Morningstar.", "Erin Lash - Morningstar Research", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I apologize if I missed this earlier, but one of the things that stood out to me in the operating expense line was that delivery costs were lower. And I wondered if you could speak to that, if there was an anomaly this quarter, or whether that's a trend that you expect to continue in light of the fact that we've been hearing that truck driver shortages continue to plague firms across a number of industries?", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, it was mainly driven \u2013 at least in our case, it was mainly driven by lower fuel costs, which we called out. So, is the truck driver shortage abating? I would say that it's not getting any worse. We've kind of learned how to handle it, although it's not exactly easy; but this particular quarter we just started to see some benefit from fuel. And if you recall a quarter or so ago, we talked about we'd start seeing some benefit in the back half of the year, and this is it.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Erin, I would only add \u2013 I think where we have driver shortages, and where it's not self-inflicted, it's generally in these areas where there has been a lot of drilling and a lot of energy. And so, as that's subsided somewhat, I think that has actually created a little more capacity. So, we're not all the way back there, but I think that pressure is a little less than what it was six months or nine months ago.", "Erin Lash - Morningstar Research", "Okay. Thanks. That's very, very helpful. And then, just my second question with regards to a lot of the press surrounding the avian bird flu and whether that will \u2013 or to what degree you think that that could impact your cost structure going forward.", "William J. DeLaney - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Erin, it's really too early for me to make a call on that. I don't think to a large extent, but it's certainly \u2013 those types of things are things we monitor regularly, but at this point, I'd say \u2013 I wouldn't say that's a big issue from a cost.", "Robert Chris Kreidler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, it's affecting some of the supply as you're reading and that obviously has some impact out there. It's only if it starts affecting a very large part of the supply, not just here in the U.S. but offshore as well, but it begins to impact our ability to find product and distribute it to our customers. Thus far, that's not the case. But as Bill said, we watch this stuff. We stand up crisis teams when it's important and when it becomes relevant.", "Erin Lash - Morningstar Research", "Thank you. That's helpful.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our Q&A session and our conference call for today. We appreciate your participation.

Joining me in Houston today are Bill DeLaney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 26, 2015, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning.

All comments about earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Sysco's first quarter financial results announced this morning reflect important early progress toward achieving the three-year financial targets we established for operating income and return on invested capital at our September Investor Day. The key leverage for realizing these targets are accelerating local case growth, improving gross margins, leveraging our supply chain costs and reducing administrative costs.", "The quality of our overall business results for the quarter was very good, driven by strong volume growth with both our locally and corporate-managed customers and sound gross margin management. However, sales growth was minimal and earnings were essentially flat due in large part to the unfavorable impact of both food cost deflation and currency translation. These two factors have somewhat restrained our performance for a good portion of the calendar year and we expect that these headwinds will persist for the next few months.", "Looking at broader economic and industry trends, we continue to see mixed data points with evidence of both underlying strength and optimism, but also pockets of concern. Consumer confidence recently rebounded to its yearly highs in September, but then fell back in October. Unemployment remains at low levels although non-farm employment levels have decreased steadily since May.", "NPD data for the three-month period ending in August showed continued positive restaurant spend with traffic growth rebounding from the prior three-month period. The QSR segment continues to be the main driver of positive restaurant traffic while fine dining segment also returned to a positive growth rate. Overall, restaurant traffic appears to be slightly positive. While still favorable on an absolute level, recent NRA data for September showed a decline in restaurant performance and foodservice operator confidence to levels last seen in late 2014.", "Turning to our first quarter results, I'm especially pleased with performance of our U.S. Broadline business. As you know, this part of our business represents approximately 70% of Sysco's revenues and 90% of our profits. During the first quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.4% including local case growth of 2%, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth. Gross profit dollar growth of 4.6%, nearly 2% more than our operating expense growth of 2.7%, and operating income growth of 6.4%. This performance was strong, especially after considering the impact of 1% food cost deflation in U.S. Broadline business, and drove Sysco's overall gross profit growth of more than 2% and year-over-year gross margin expansion of approximately 0.25%.", "Expense management trends continue to improve in much of our business as reflected in the $0.01 per case cost reduction in the U.S. Broadline business compared to the prior year. However, such improvement was offset by planned investment in merger-related carryover technology spend for projects that will provide key support to achieving our financial targets over the next three years.", "As I stated a moment ago, two of the key levers to achieving our three-year financial plan are: one, accelerating our local case growth; and, two, improving margins. Our results this quarter reflect good progress on doing exactly that. A few examples of the progress we've made in various areas to produce these results include our category management work, which continues to provide incremental benefits to both our customers and Sysco; improve Sysco brand penetration, especially with locally-managed customers; and continued progress with our revenue management development work and early success in our pilot locations. In summary, our underlying business has good momentum and we are in the right path to achieving our long-term financial and strategic objectives.", "For now, I'll turn it over to Joel for some additional details, and then I'll come back to summarize before we go to the Q&A.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, the first quarter results were of good quality, in particular for our core underlying business, the U.S. Broadline. Today, I'm going to discuss the details of the first quarter results on an adjusted basis, which mainly excludes expenses related to the termination of the proposed merger of the US Foods, as well as provide some additional pro forma comparisons on a constant currency basis.", "Our first quarter sales increased by roughly 1%, despite the deflation and currency headwinds Bill noted. For some additional color on the inflation volatility we've experienced over the past year, we have transitioned from 5% inflation last year to a 0.2% deflation this year. In addition, as Bill mentioned, deflation in the U.S. Broadline was even greater at about 1% for the first quarter.", "From a category perspective, center-of-the-plate protein and dairy drove the majority of this deflation with disinflation across many other categories. To put the deflation in context, the deflationary environment has developed two times over the past 10 years, lasting three months to nine months in length when it occurred.", "As for foreign exchange, this quarter we saw continued strength in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the euro. Since Canada represents the majority of our international sales, the Canadian dollar valuation was the main driver for the negative 2% impact to sales in the quarter, which is the largest impact we've experienced in recent history. When we look at our sales on a constant currency basis, they're up 3%.", "Turning to other sales drivers, we reported solid case growth this quarter, including 3.4% total and 2% local in U.S. Broadline. In addition, local and corporate-managed case growth across our total Broadline operations remained healthy. Despite the headwinds from foreign exchange and deflation, gross profit growth was solid at 2.3% and gross margin expanded by 23 basis points over the prior year. Positive contributors to gross profit growth include solid local case growth, category management and improved Sysco brand penetration. On a constant currency basis, gross profit increased by 4.3%.", "Turning to expenses, certain items during the first quarter totaled $108 million, the vast majority of which were related to the termination of our merger agreement with US Foods, including $10 million that was adjusted out of operating expenses and $95 million that hit the interest expense line. As previously mentioned, this will be the final quarter to be impacted by certain items pertaining to the US Foods merger termination.", "In total, our adjusted operating expense in the first quarter increased by $52 million over the prior year, mainly driven by payroll, which was impacted by both volume increases and a $9 million increase in our long-term incentive accruals. The increase in the long-term incentive accrual was related to our total shareholder return metric and was driven by the improvement in our stock price performance relative to the S&P 500.", "During the first quarter, we also started to see early signs of productivity improvements and cost reductions within our supply chain, as cost per case is down approximately $0.01 in our U.S. Broadline business. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses grew by about 5%. Adjusted operating income was down 0.5% or $3 million. However, on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income would have been up 1.2%.", "As for our SYGMA business, we are beginning to see modest signs of improvement. For the first quarter, SYGMA sales were down 6.2%, as segment operating income grew 1.4%. As we previously mentioned, we have transitioned some SYGMA business, which did pressure sales, but did not negatively impact our profitability. That said, we remain focused on improving productivity, efficiency and customer profitability in SYGMA and will continue to closely monitor its progress.", "Moving to other income, I want to remind you that we consolidate the results of some of the entities we control, but do not have 100% ownership of. These represent investments in joint ventures, including some that are in the early investments or start-up phase. As such, our other income line this quarter reflects a $15 million improvement that is mostly attributable to the elimination of the non-Sysco portion of the results associated with these ventures.", "Our income tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 36%, both on a GAAP and on an adjusted basis. As a reminder, the adjusted rate is on the low end of our 36% to 37% normalized rate. The GAAP rate benefited from the impact of merger-related items, which offset the strength in our U.S. business. Adjusted net earnings grew about 1% and benefited from both higher other income and a lower tax rate versus last year.", "Adjusted earnings per share were flat for the quarter. Foreign exchange impacted earnings per share results by $0.01 per share. In addition, share count was up over 7 million shares versus the prior year, negatively impacting earnings per share by $0.01 per share as well.", "As a reminder, we have historically repurchased shares in the open market to offset dilution from new share issuances, but we have not done so for the past five quarters. We expect to resume these purchases later this year.", "As you may know, we have commenced an accelerated share repurchase program or ASR, but it had no impact on share count in this quarter. For those of you not familiar with the mechanics of the ASR, here's some details. Our broker borrowed 85%, or approximately 32 million shares, and delivered them to us on September 28, at which time our outstanding share count was reduced by that amount. Over the next several months, our broker will then acquire these shares through various mechanisms, including open market purchases. The balance of the shares covered by the accelerated share repurchase will be trued up during settlement over the next several months.", "As it pertains to cash flow, cash flow from operations for the first quarter was a negative $261 million, including the cash impact of certain items which reduced cash flow from operations by $260 million. Excluding the impact of certain items, adjusted cash flow from operations was essentially flat.", "From a working capital perspective, we saw improvements in net working capital this quarter, driven by improvements in both the accounts receivable and inventory areas. This resulted in working capital using approximately $70 million less cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 than it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.", "Net CapEx was $120 million for the quarter, generally flat year-over-year, mainly reflecting fleet replenishment and our investments in technology initiatives that we discussed during Investor Day. Free cash flow for the first quarter was a negative $381 million, which includes the $260 million impact of certain items. Please keep in mind that our free cash flow is seasonal, as we use more cash earlier in the fiscal year and then see larger sequential quarterly increases in free cash flow throughout the remainder of the year.", "Finally, I want to remind you of the expected impact of the accelerated share repurchase on our fiscal 2016 share count and earnings per share. On our last earnings call, we said that we anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016, driven by a 4% to 5% reduction in average shares outstanding, partially offset by higher interest expense and new debt issuance. Now that we've begun execution of this plan, we still maintain this guidance.", "I'll now turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Joel. In summary, I am encouraged by the quality of our first quarter results and in particular with performance of our U.S. Broadline business. We are now experiencing consistent improvement in our local volume growth trends and gross margin management in this all-important part of our business, as a result of improved execution of several commercial initiatives implemented over the past few years. Expense management trends have improved of-late, and we are also making good strides in developing and refining action plans to accelerate additional cost improvement benefits, both in our supply chain and administrative areas of Sysco. We will provide regular updates on an ongoing basis in achieving our targeted results for improving our customers' experience, enhancing associate engagement and meeting our 2018 financial goals for operating income and return on invested capital.", "And with that, operator, we'll now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hey, Bill. So two things: number one, what's the update on the competitive pricing environment? I think it had heated up a little bit going back a couple of months, but yet I would think as we go forward here and things normalize that we would see that calm down quite a bit. And then, secondly, if I look at your U.S. Broadline EBIT up 6.4%, is there any way to kind of parse through what that might be in a more normal inflation environment? Would it be the same but have different components, or would it be different?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Good morning, John. On that competitive environment, I would say pretty much what we've been saying. The competitive environment remains very acute and comes in all forms of competitors, large, small...", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Yeah.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "...local, regional, et cetera, national, that kind of thing. As far as I think what you're getting at, some of our larger competitors, they're on different stages right now in terms of where they are in developing and driving out their strategic plans and that type of thing. So I would say generally, John, the competitive environment remains very competitive, but reasonably rational. And yet at the same time, I would tell you in any given day, in any given market, there's probably some volatility and probably some inconsistencies with what I'm just telling you there. But I don't think a big change from when we would've talked a few months ago.", "As far as the U.S. Broadline's concerned, it's good question, I would say to you \u2013 let me, without the deflation, honestly, I would just tell you it would have been much better, or at least somewhat better without the deflation. We had good gross profit growth, as I said, even with deflation, very good case growth and we managed the margins well. We've got work to do, John. So we still have work to do on the expense side here, in all parts of our business, and we're beginning to make some strides there. But I would say, without the deflation, the U.S. Broadline would have been \u2013 probably had somewhat of a stronger performance.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And then, just as a follow-up to that, when you think about your long-term targets, I mean, it strikes me that with all you're doing on revenue management and kind of where you've been, gross margin \u2013 and I guess this was hit on a little bit during the Analyst Day, but gross could surprise to the upside, the other piece, right, as it holding SG&A growth to 3% seems a little tough if you're seeing some case growth. At the end of the day, do you \u2013 I mean, the 1% spread, that's the goal. Do you think it's pretty likely that that spread holds? But it's possible that we see both the gross profit and SG&A growing some \u2013 a fair bit faster than that, or that seems unlikely?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think it just depends. I mean, right now, deflation is somewhat of a headwind as it relates to the gross profit growth. And there's a lot of things, as you know, John, that impact margin from macro events to mix, and all that type of thing. I think what I'm conveying to you today is a lot of these initiatives that we've taken on over last two years or three years are beginning to bear fruit, whether it's how we manage our sales force, rolling out CatMan, continuing to work on the brand in the right way in conjunction with CatMan, and early days of revenue management which manifests itself in a lot of different ways. So I'm feeling good about our ability to manage margin. I think what you heard us say at the Analyst Day or the Investor Day, there's things we don't control. So right now our GP was up \u2013 it was up what it was up overall, was up nicely in the U.S. Broadline.", "But I would \u2013 we're not at that spread right now overall. So I would say to you the plan here is to get back to that spread of at least 1% between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth. And what do we need to do to do that? We need to maintain the momentum we've got on local case growth, we've got to continue to manage those gross margins well, and we do need to get our expense increases to a lower level.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Meredith Adler from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if there were any particular initiatives you were using to drive the locally-managed case growth? And then, I have one other quick question.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think it's a lot of things, Meredith. If you recall the Investor Day, Tom Ben\u00e9 spoke, he took you through a lot of different strategies and processes that we're doing. I would say under Tom's leadership, there's some basic things, there's a very tight cadence of meetings between him and his market leadership in the field, weekly, monthly, quarterly, that type of thing. So we've got good continuity there. Some of the segmentation work that Tom spoke to, both in terms of customer segmentation, product category opportunities, those are \u2013 looking for opportunities within every cell that we operate in, whether it's geographically across customer segments, we talked about Hispanic, we talked about potential more opportunity in the local fresh area, that type of thing. But also just basic things where you sit down, as a management team, whether it's locally or through the CatMan group and look at categories that you may be underpenetrated in.", "So we've got good alignment around good basic business principles, good connectivity between what we're doing here at corporate into the market and then obviously where it all happens in the field. And I will also tell you, CatMan continues to help. It's going to \u2013 as it matures in terms of some of the sourcing aspects of it, it's going to help us, I think, create more momentum on innovation and, over time, optimizing our SKU count as we strike the right balance between reducing SKUs where we have redundancies, but also broadening our SKUs for some of the items that may be new or maybe don't move quite as fast, but they're particularly important to customers. So a lot of it's process and a lot of it's, again, going back to these commercial initiatives that we've been developing and employing here over the last two years or three years.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So is it \u2013 are these changes, or would you say just getting some things that you've started working on sort of coming to fruition?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's both. So if you go back and so the \u2013 some of the sales tools and that type of thing we've been using for three years or more, they're beginning to mature; CatMan has been out there for two years or three years. But the revenue management work is really just beginning. And so we're in various stages on all these. I think probably the biggest thing right now, outside of that, Meredith, is I just feel we have really good alignment right now across that whole triangle we took you through between facing up, where it matters most which is at the customer level, supporting that in the market and then continuing to develop good tools here, but field-ready tools and we're getting better at that.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And then just my quick sort of follow-up question is, I noticed again this quarter you had added back some severance costs and I was wondering was there some kind of a severance program or a layoff program somewhere in the company that you hadn't specifically called out?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We have some ongoing opportunities there. I'll let Joel speak.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Meredith, this is Joel. I'd call that more just on a normal basis. There's nothing significant that happened there.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So they're added back for what reason, if they're ongoing?", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "They're added back because I think as we go through this transformation, Meredith, there's going to be some peaks and valleys on that line and right now we're in a little bit of a valley, which is nice. But it's \u2013 again, we're transforming here a $45 billion, $50 billion company that's been in business for 40 years. So we'll continue to optimize our workforce.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I see. Okay, thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And next from Jefferies, we have Mark Wiltamuth. Please go ahead.", "Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Wanted to just kind of find out where some of the weakness is here, because if your Broadline business is 90% of profits and that was up 6.4%, and SYGMA was actually modestly profitable, where is the big missing link here to get you down to a flat operating income performance? Is there some sizeable international losses, or just non-core businesses that are weaker?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would say most of our businesses perform very well. There's a couple that didn't. I wouldn't say those are overly material to your question. As I mentioned in my comments, we've got some planned expense increases at corporate, largely in the business technology area. We talked about this over the last couple calls. We had some projects that we're going down the road in anticipation of US Foods merger on some opportunities here that we think are very compelling, especially in the customer-facing side of the business. And so we've continued on with those and that's created, on a year-over-year basis, a bigger delta on the expense side of corporate. And Joel mentioned, we took a hit on some long-term incentives here because of the stock performance. So it's a little bit of everything, but it's mostly corporate, some of which was planned, some of which was just kind of the mark-to-market, if you will, of the LTI.", "Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Okay.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "As well as the foreign exchange impact, just as a reminder.", "Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And this \u2013 over time, is there going to be some normalization of the corporate expenses now that you're kind of not pursuing US Foods? And maybe can you give us an arc on what that spending looks like?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I would answer that in the context of all expenses. And so again, as we continue to evolve here as a company, there's certainly a corporate group and there's markets and OpCos, but we look at optimizing the spend throughout. And so if you go back to those four levers I talked about, the last two levers are really about optimizing our expense management and so there's significant opportunity there, we believe, both on the supply chain side as well as on the administrative side and we're working through that now. You saw some of it on supply chain side this quarter. We had a pretty good quarter there. And on the administrative side, those are more thoughtful processes that we need to go through and we'll communicate those to you over the next few months.", "Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And following, we have Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, Bill, just a follow-up on the cost control side. Your expense growth up in the 3% range and, clearly, just looking at the way that you reported U.S. Broadline performance, there were some expenses in here that sound like over time should eventually kind of roll off. How should we think about SG&A growth over the next few quarters? And then, over time, is there an ability to grow SG&A at a slower rate than what it's growing at today? Because the case growth was pretty good, you had 3% SG&A growth, but there's a lot of corporate spend in there. If you could just sort of help us put it all together in terms of how we should be thinking about this?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Thanks, Ed. The way I would be thinking about both the way we laid out our three-year goals as well as the way this year's plan is targeted is, in that three-year plan we said it wouldn't be linear, this year's not going to be linear, and there's less of a trajectory, if you will, in the operating income in the first year than there is in year-two and year-three. The short answer to your question is, yes. I think as we get into breaking down those costs, especially, I don't really want to call them SG&A, I'm just going to call them administrative costs regardless of what part of the business they're in. Whether they're locally or corporate or in between and whether they're purely admin or just administrative in nature, you should expect to see those numbers \u2013 that growth to \u2013 that curve to become more shallow as we go forward.", "What I was saying on the earlier question was we did plan in some meaningful technology spend this year to finish off some projects that we had started with the merger that are very compelling from a customer-facing standpoint, but also have significant costs. And so that's driving a lot of that expense delta here right now. So I was pleased with the overall cost per piece in the business. The corporate department's actually managed their expenses fine. We have the technology spend and then we had this other issue here on the incentive accrual. So short answer to your question is, it will begin to grow at a slower rate, and that's probably going to take us another couple quarters to give you some visibility to that.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. But then after that, shouldn't like the true performance of Broadline's, which is really what you're trying to communicate here, should be more evident?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Correct.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. And then just a follow-up for you here. It's been a few months, I guess, at least, since Trian's become more involved with the company and, at the Analyst Day, you had kind of suggested that there hadn't really been too much, I guess, influence yet. I was just curious as to whether you could provide some update in terms of the impact they're having on your business and the way you think about things strategically, if at all, yet?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, sure. Well, I think at the Analyst Day, they had just come on (30:54) the board, I think, within a week or two that \u2013 or two or three weeks at least of that day. So I don't want to speak for them, but they've been doing \u2013 continuing to do their work. So they've pulled a lot of data and they're looking at a lot of information, they're visiting facilities, they're meeting with our management team, that type of thing. Their first real board meeting is our board meeting in November. And I'm sure we'll, at that point, between now and then and then after that, get better clarity on their thoughts in more detail and the breadth of their thoughts. And as board members, we'll work through it appropriately.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And following, we have Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I had just two housekeeping questions and then a bigger picture question. Can you give us the case volume growth including SYGMA? That used to be a metric that you gave us, just wondering if you could give us that again?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We can get that for you, Karen. The only reason we don't show that anymore is because, obviously, we're going through some transition with SYGMA, so we don't think it's overly reflective of what's going on in the company. But if we can't give it to you in the call, we'll get back to you.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And the second housekeeping I just had is, do you have the private label penetration as a percent of sales at the local level? Is it fairly consistent with the Broadline number that you have in your press release, or is it lower, higher?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We track it that way, but because you have customers that transition back and forth. Generally they go one way into pure Street to local contract to corporate-managed. We think looking at it in total is better. So I would say generally we're seeing a comparable growth with the local business as well.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then I guess just a bigger picture question. I guess, obviously, you've told us a lot about how you plan to focus on local customers, and it obviously sounds like the right strategy. But is there anything about Sysco specifically that give you a competitive advantage in capturing and retaining the customer? And I guess I'm asking because it's obviously a higher margin customer, so that strategically makes sense. But I mean, it doesn't make sense that all your competitors are going to be doing the same thing? So what is it about Sysco that makes you more attractive as a supplier or affords you better retention? Any color on that would be great.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Karen, I didn't understand, can you just restate the first part of your question? What is it about Sysco, is that what you're asking?", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, it just seems obvious that everyone should be going after the higher margin customer, which is the local customer. So all your competitors are doing the same thing, I would assume. So is there anything specifically about Sysco that would help you retain or capture a customer or have better success at capturing that customer and retaining them versus your competitors?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Well, I think there's a lot of things. I mean, I think it's not like we just started doing that, okay, we've been doing it for 45 years. Half of that $50 billion we do, roughly half of that is with local or Street, a little bit more if you go to local. So it's the DNA of the company. It's in our \u2013 it's woven into the fabric of this company. It's how we've grown to where we are today. I think the point we made at Investor Day is with some of the challenges we've had in the macro environment and the acute \u2013 the increased competition that came from 2009, simultaneously with us driving out a heck of a lot of transformational change. We've struggled over the last few years until last year to drive the local case growth. So it's nothing new, it's just something we haven't done as well as we would have liked over the last few years, and there's reasons for that.", "So in terms of why Sysco? I think it starts with our sales force. We've got 7,000 marketing associates across the country. Our structure that we continue to find ways to optimize, but one of the reasons we've remained very local is because, as I said many times, about two-thirds of our revenue stream comes from customers whose decision makers are domiciled within 100 miles, 150 miles of that operating company. So that creates a need, not just for local sales representation, but for local leadership with our presidents and senior teams there. So I think our geographic footprint, the talent of our operating teams, the experience and the breadth of our sales force, all these new things that we've been talking about earlier on the call on the commercial initiative side, from CatMan to rev man to segmentation, listening to our customers in a much more effective way through over the last three or four years, that have led to increased loyalty. The fact that we had the courage to take on transforming this company at a time \u2013 key inflection point in our country and in our industry, we're one of the few people in our industry that has taken on this kind of change. So I think the fact that we're forward-looking and we've got great people and we've got great strategy, I think those are all reasons why we should continue to have a lot of success.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, Karen, this is Joel. Just the total Broadline plus SYGMA case growth was 2.4% for the quarter, as a follow-up.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to go back to inflation and deflation, what you're seeing on a category basis. I know that the slight deflation you call as center of the plate and dairy primarily, but how was that relative to your internal expectations for this quarter? And then has anything more recently changed? I know that you said kind of for the next few months, just maybe a little bit more color on how you see the inflation/deflation outlook this year?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Vinnie, I'll start and then let Joel kind of tighten it up a little bit. I would say what's different is there's just a little more deflation than maybe what we would have expected three months ago when we were on this call in U.S. Broadline, and it appears to be lasting longer. And so I would tell you it's probably going to get a little worse before it gets better. We're seeing that early part of this quarter, and I think it could be with us at least into the third quarter. Joel?", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. And I guess the other thing I'd just remind you of, again, we certainly think about inflation in our business by category. And so, again, many of the categories we have are relatively flat and then so some of the volatility we're seeing really is in a couple categories. It's a little bit harder to see where that's headed, but again as Bill mentioned, it certainly feels like it's going to get a little bit worse before it gets better as we move throughout the rest of this year.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks, guys. And as a quick follow-up, at your Analyst Day you had made a quick mention of you doing some work with Kroger and some of its fresh products, I know that obviously that's probably pretty small at this point. But maybe just any kind of early reads or color on the scope and if that overall initiative is something that you could see expanding going forward?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Vinnie, I think what we said was, we're just beginning to do that work and it's just been a few weeks. So, so far so good, early days, but we're very excited about the opportunity.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "All right. Thanks, Bill.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And following, we have Andrew Wolf from BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Hi. Good morning. On the 2% local case growth, do you have a feel for how you would split that between what the market's giving you in terms of growth, maybe with independents having positive same-store sales, if they are, versus how much share you might be taking?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, that'd be difficult, Andy. Certainly, as I said at the Investor Day, the market environment, even today's comments, there's not a lot of consistency to it. But I think when you look at it in the context of where we were five years or six years ago, or even two years or three years ago, we're in a better market environment. So I'm sure that's helping everybody to some degree, but I certainly would think that we're taking share with 2% growth. And we update those numbers about once a year.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. On the Broadline, the preview to the segment numbers, could you give us a sense of what the sales were up in U.S. Broadline?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm not following you. What's the question?", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "I'm sorry. You gave us U.S. Broadline operating profit, you gave us all the \u2013 sort of the mini P&L except for the sales increase on the U.S. Broadline. And just so we could get a sense of where the leverage was, sort of back of the envelope I got to a little over 3%. Is that about right?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let us dig for that and we'll come back to you on that one, too.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Again, I just wanted to follow up on, when Joel was talking about the other income, because fourth quarter was even a bigger number than this quarter. And to be honest, I didn't quite understand what you meant by the elimination of some non-Sysco portion and what that meant. So first it's \u2013 the last two quarters combined, it's added $0.03 to EPS, about $0.01 this and about $0.02 last quarter. So is this something that's going to be a meaningful or smallish meaningful part of earnings going forward? Or do we just get two more quarters of some kind of change in accounting?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would just tell you it's line item gymnastics and then I'll let Joel kind of take it from there.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. The way I would think about that, again, it's joint ventures that are reported on a consolidation method. So if you look at each one of the lines in sales, gross profit, expenses, operating income, up above the operating income line, they're consolidated and then below the line the portion that's, I'll say, the non-Sysco, the part that we don't own is backed out. So if you net out all of it between the above the line and below the line, it's a relatively small number, but that's the way the accounting works and that's why that part of it shows up in the other income. Hope that helps?", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. There's a non-majority ownership, in other words, and then so the whole thing's reported up above and then the minority, the part that we don't own, is backed out down below.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Andy, and the U.S. Broadline sales, looks like it's a little over 2%.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Little over 2%. Okay, thank you. I'll just talk to you offline about the other income thing. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Oh, boy, thanks. I just had a question about some of the cost-cutting opportunities. It seemed like at your investor conference one of the major themes was you've got a very growth-oriented outlook. And I understand that it's very early in your three-year planning process and that it's not a linear runway. But just from a cost-cutting perspective, where do you see the addressable opportunity and what are some of the major pockets, if you can talk about that? And then as a related question, like could you significantly reduce some of the variable costs like payroll costs without hurting your sales? So to what extent is that an issue in relation to your three-year outlook? Thanks.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Ajay, I think what we certainly attempted to convey at the Investor Day was we need to continue to grow. We believe we can grow profitably and take share in the right way, but it needs to be more targeted growth than what we've seen over the past. We need a little more balance between the corporate-managed growth and the local growth. And it's not that we don't want corporate-managed growth, we do, we just need to see a little bit more balance there. So I think on the cost cutting, the way I actually look at it in terms of running a business, we'll go to your last question, which is to cut costs, there's no trophies for cutting costs, right? So to cut costs and to do it in a way where you don't anticipate what the downside would be, would be somewhat foolish on our part. And that's why we're taking some time here on the administrative cost side to go through and look at the work, look at the prioritization of the work, look at the sequencing of the work, look at the structure, look at how much we still need to do on the technology side, for example, to continue to be up there in front with our customers and be responsive to their needs.", "So what we're doing right now is prioritizing all that in a way that we need to put it together in a fiscally responsible way and then we'll bring it back to you and to our customer base and to our associates in the most balanced way that we can and in the least risky way that we can. So certainly, if we were to go out and cut back dramatically on customer-facing technology support or customer-facing associates, that wouldn't be very smart way to proceed here. So we're proceeding \u2013 we see opportunity, as I've said multiple times now, in all parts of the business. Where you're seeing us focused primarily right now is on supply chain and the administrative side. And I think over the next couple quarters, we'll be able to give you more visibility to that.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was just curious as you look at your case growth, either local or in total, if you could talk about any of the trends that you're seeing there, either product types or categories that are really working well? And I guess, somewhat related to that, many restaurants and QSRs have recently announced plans to transition their proteins towards antibiotic-free, and I was just curious if you could talk about how you're positioned against that trend with both your customers and suppliers?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Kelly, it's Bill. I think on the first part of the question, if you go back and look over the last two or three years and look at where our growth has come out, I think we've done a really nice job in building out the center of the plate. So in particular, those protein items that you're talking about, whether it's meat, seafood, poultry, and even the produce and dairy, along the way, so continue to, I think, see good opportunity there. A lot of it's fresh, not all of it though. I think it's still a little early to tell. We certainly acknowledge and are reacting and trying to be as proactive as possible in terms of some of the accelerating trends as it relates to the local and the organic and that type of thing as well as the ethnic opportunities. I would tell you those are real trends and meaningful and very important to our customers. I don't know that I can tell you today that that's really driving substantial dollars, but certainly it's an area where we need to be going forward.", "I think your second question, I probably need to do a little more work on. I think we've had some good initiatives going on, both on the merchandising side of our business, in particular in conjunction with CatMan, in the sustainability area, and we're putting more resources into those. So let us come back to you on that in terms of how all that winds up going forward.", "Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "That's helpful. And then just on deflation, I think last year when inflation was running quite a bit higher, there was some difficulty in passing all those on. Could you just talk about how deflation impacted your gross margin in the quarter? Was there any lag in passing that along? Was that helpful to the gross margin? Or I guess it depends on the category, but any color you could provide there?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I get this question a lot and I'm going to stay consistent with what I've always said. The ideal place for us to be would be to have two to three points of inflation across every category. I mean, that's as good as it gets, I've never seen it in 27 years of doing this. But that would be very good. And why is that? That's because history tells you and the data tells you that most of our customers are able to pass that type of increase along in a reasonably manageable way, and in a way that works for their business. So 2% to 3% overall would be fine. When it gets up over that, 4%, 5%, 6%, that's not good for our customers, and that's when it starts to also make it difficult for us to pass that much along on a timely basis.", "Deflation would be the least attractive of all of those. It probably does \u2013 it certainly does help your margin to some extent in terms of the percentage. But as we all understand, you're taking fewer dollars to the bank to pay bills. So it puts a lot of pressure on your expenses along the way. So deflation, we haven't seen a lot of it. We did some work on this. I think over the last decade, we've only had deflation a couple times and I think it's ranged from, in one instance, 0.25% or so, in another instance, maybe up to 0.75%. We think we'll probably be on the longer end of that this time around. But it's a challenging environment. But I will tell you, I think we're doing a good job, striking the right balance in terms of managing that down in a way that works for the customer, but still is working for us, and I think you saw that in the numbers this quarter.", "Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Got it. And then just one other question. You talked in the beginning about some of the economic factors being somewhat mixed overall, but then you mentioned, I think, that there was a pretty sharp pullback in confidence among restaurant operators. And I was just curious you had any color on what you think drove that or what maybe you're hearing from your customers about why that would be?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think what we said on the restaurant part of it was it went back to kind of where we were about a year ago. So I mean it's still much improved over the last three or four years, both in consumer confidence and in those NRA statistics. We're almost back to where we were in 2009. Again, that's 2009, so need to put that in some context. It's hard to pinpoint. Look, restaurant operators, they're people like all of us. So I think when you see a stock market going up and down with that kind of volatility, it makes people nervous, and that could be part of it. What we're really telling you is there didn't seem to be any discernible medium-term trend. It's up for a quarter or two and then it's down and then back up again. So overall, in the context of looking back two, three, four years, it's much better. It's just hard to see a pattern here.", "Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Great. Thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you. Just actually a quick follow-up on your comments on the industry. Could you talk a little bit about, if it's appropriate, October? And I ask this, whether it's casual dining or even some fast casual that there was some apparent slowdown in October relative to previous months. Is that something that you're seeing in terms of your Street and Broadline accounts as well?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Actually, I haven't seen a lot of October data yet, John. Our trends are pretty similar to what we saw in the first quarter. As I said, deflation has accelerated a little bit more, but we're not seeing any big change. It's tough for us week-to-week. Holidays fall on different weeks or days and that kind of thing, but I would just tell you sitting here, I can't tell you there's been any big shift in demand or anything like that.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And thank you for that. Then secondly, obviously, the restaurant industry gets the opposite of what it was a couple of years ago where there's no labor inflation and there is significant commodity inflation. So as you think about the pricing environment as you can pass on pricing to your restaurant customers as your own labor costs are higher. Do you think we're in an environment that could be modestly better from a pricing environment relative to what we've seen before?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm sorry, could it be what?", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Are we in an environment where you can pass on more pricing to restaurant customers than you could before? I mean, I understand that you are \u2013 the pricing of your products coming in through your back door is deflationary, but is this a potentially better pricing environment from Sysco into the restaurant customers as restaurant customers are seeing (51:08)?", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I don't know about that. I think what you're hearing from us is we begin to develop a real revenue management process as there's opportunities for us with analytics in terms of the segmentation we're doing, both across product categories as well as customers. There's opportunities for us to be smarter and more consistent and to be more on the market in terms of what's important to our customers. So I think that's the bigger opportunity. I was with a customer the other day, and you were pointing out labor, it's the biggest thing we hear today from every customer we talk to, and you see it in the press. There's a labor shortage out there. They're having to adjust their cost structure accordingly. And I think that actually does the opposite of your question, it puts a little more pressure on us on pricing because they're always looking for opportunities to manage their costs. But overall, I'd say it's not a bad environment right now from a pricing standpoint, other than the deflation aspect of it.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Understood. Thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. We appreciate everyone's participation. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any closing and additional remarks.", "Neil A.

To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we would like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. This morning Sysco reported a strong second quarter and a solid first half of the year. These results reflect the continuously improving execution of our portfolio of strategic initiatives by all of our associates. Further, our favorable performance over the past several quarters validates that our ongoing focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco and increasing productivity in all aspects of our business are key to our future success.", "From an overall economic and industry perspective, calendar year fourth quarter U.S. GDP and consumer confidence data was mixed as favorable unemployment trends and lower gas prices somewhat offset increased concern about near-term business conditions and global uncertainty. Most recently, the precipitous drop in multiple stock market indices bears watching as it relates to potential adverse ramifications for consumers and our customers.", "As far as the restaurant industry data is concerned, the overall trend remain reasonably positive amid sluggish consumer spending. According to the National Restaurant Association, December marked the 11th consecutive month of foodservice sales growth.", "This closes out a strong year for the industry where foodservice sales exceeded grocery store sales throughout the year. That said, both NPD and NavTrak have shown some recent modest declines in traffic trends that we are closely monitoring.", "With respect to product cost deflation, we saw an acceleration during the second quarter, driven by key center-of-the-plate categories such as meat, poultry and pork, as well as dairy. This trend has continued into the third quarter and we currently believe that deflation headwinds will persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year.", "Now, moving to our second quarter results. Total Broadline cases grew 3.4% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 0.6% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange headwinds of 1.7%. Gross profit dollars grew 3.4% and gross margin increased 50 basis points.", "Adjusted operating income for the quarter grew $41 million or 10% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 17%. And importantly, we had solid execution across the business including the U.S. Broadline.", "Reflecting on the first half of our fiscal 2016 performance, overall, our team executed well and we are making good progress towards the achievement of our key financial objectives by focusing on the following four key levers. Accelerating local case growth, improving gross margin, leveraging supply chain costs, and reducing administrative costs.", "Specifically, we achieved the following during first half of the year. Total Broadline local cases grew 2.8%. We grew gross profit by $121 million, expanded gross margin by 36 basis points, and grew gross profit modestly faster than expenses. We grew adjusted operating income 4% or $38 million, and we grew adjusted earnings per share of 7.5%.", "As we enter the second half of our fiscal year, we have strong momentum in the business. We do, however, need to continue to effectively manage the persistent deflationary headwinds that likely will challenge our performance going forward. Further, we are aggressively reviewing all aspects of our business for incremental cost savings opportunities to improve our financial performance.", "At our Investor Day presentation last September, we laid out three key results that our three year strategic plan is targeting through 2018. Improve our customers' experience with Sysco, enhance associate engagement, and achieve our financial objectives of increasing operating income by at least $400 million, growing earnings per share faster than operating income, and achieving a 15% return on invested capital. I remain confident that we're well positioned to achieve those goals.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad to be joining the call this morning with all of you. In my new role, I'm excited to bring our business operations, commercial functions and supply chain organizations together to drive improved execution and a seamless approach to serving our customers. This approach will better position Sysco to provide exceptional service and support to our customers, and ultimately improve our returns to our shareholders.", "I'd like to begin my remarks regarding the second quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our three-year plan and how they have already begun to have an impact on our business results.", "As we have mentioned before, our insights-based approach to understanding and meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts. Our improved processes and tools in this area are allowing us to leverage our very robust base of information to design a variety of initiatives to improve the retention and penetration of our current customers as well as to accelerate the addition of new customers.", "And while we have much work still to do, we are beginning to see positive results. For example, during the second quarter, our U.S. Broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.9%, including local case growth of 3%, gross profit dollar growth of 5.5%, including an improvement margin of 57 basis points, and operating income growth of about 9%, supported by solid operating expense performance.", "From a geographic perspective, we saw solid year-over-year improvement in both cases and gross margin across the U.S., with specific strength in the Mideast. Southeast, and the Pacific markets. This was somewhat offset by signs of growth slowing in our traditionally-strong Southwest market due to the impact of the downturn in the energy sector.", "One example of how we're driving increased case growth is in the area of fresh and local products where we're helping to educate our customers that we have significant capability through our Broadline operations and our specialty companies to bring fresh and local produce to the market. As an example of how we differentiate ourselves in this segment, in order to grow cases, our Sysco quality assurance team has partnered with the Produce Marketing Association to deliver good agricultural practices workshops to more than 800 small farmers since 2011, helping prepare our small local growers to meet our food safety standards.", "As you know, improving gross margin is one of the key drivers of Sysco achieving our three-year targets. And our strong performance this quarter indicates we are making progress towards achieving our long-term objectives.", "To that point, I am pleased with how well we've managed the current deflationary environment, which has certainly slowed sales dollar growth. Our ability to manage this environment well is due in part to an increased focus on Sysco brand and our category management efforts where we are able to use our purchasing scale along with the more transparent process with our supplier partners to achieve our goals. We continue to see a variety of benefits for our customers, suppliers and Sysco as category management has become a standard part of how we now operate our business.", "There are other areas that we know are improving our overall customers' experience of doing business with Sysco as well including the way we are improving the service and the support they are experiencing through our technology solutions.", "Our mobile order entry platform, which has been in pilot with customers for the past few quarters has shown strong adoption rates with both customers and our marketing associates. Now that the pilots have been completed, we are in the process of fully deploying this ordering solution across the enterprise. Additionally, we soon expect to begin pilots for the next phase of our digital eCommerce platform, which will bring additional capability, tools, and information critical to our customers to help them better run their business.", "Finally, from a supply chain perspective, we have made solid progress toward our goal to improve overall service to our customers while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process.", "As mentioned earlier, while there's still a lot more work to be done, we're seeing improved operating expense trends and we're targeting a continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year. These are just a few of the key priorities that are starting to impact our operational and financial results. And while we have much work to do, I'm confident we are on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives.", "In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well in the field, and our headquarters teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field ready tools and processes that are enabling our success.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter especially in light of the increased deflation and continued currency headwinds. We also continued to make some solid and early progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our three-year goals.", "We grew sales in the second quarter by approximately 1% year-over-year despite going from inflation of 6% in the second quarter of last year to deflation of 1% this year, including deflation of nearly 2% in U.S. Broadline.", "We saw continued deflation in center-of-the-plate protein categories as supply recovers from various events in 2015. However, as Tom mentioned, we are managing this environment well, including improved processes and programs such as category management that have helped to lessen the impact of deflation.", "Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.7% with the U.S. dollar's strength against the Canadian dollar responsible for the vast majority of the impact. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 2.2%.", "Turning to case growth, consistent with our three-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total Broadline case growth for the second quarter was 3.4%, and local was 2.9%. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total Broadline.", "Looking at gross profit and gross margins, we grew our gross profit at a solid 3.4% while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 50 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business, and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%.", "Adjusted operating expenses grew 1.8% during the quarter and by 3.5% on a constant currency basis. The increase is mainly driven by the previously-mentioned higher case volumes and planned investments in business technology. This increase in expense was partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spend, reduced fuel costs, and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our cost per case in U.S. Broadline, which was down $0.01 from the prior year.", "Also note, while we experienced a relatively minor amount of certain items related to restructuring during the second quarter, we do expect to experience additional restructuring charges related to our three-year plan over the next few quarters.", "As you know, a key part of our plan is to effectively manage the gap between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth. We achieved that objective during the second quarter, and as a result, grew adjusted operating income by 10.2% compared to the prior year and 11.6% on a constant currency basis.", "As it relates to taxes, in mid-January at an investor conference, we disclosed a $21 million benefit to income tax expense as a result of the favorable resolution of some international tax contingencies. This had the same impact on both our GAAP and adjusted tax rates, reducing both to around 31%. As a result, and as mentioned during that webcast, we reported a $0.03 benefit to earnings per share during the second quarter.", "Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 12.6% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17.1%, and 19.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher operating income and reduced tax rate. The previously-mentioned tax benefit increased earnings per share by $0.03.", "The share count decrease of 24.5 million shares related to the accelerated share repurchase program positively impacted earnings per share in the second quarter by approximately $0.02 versus the prior year. At the beginning of the second quarter, we executed the accelerated share repurchase program and therefore received the benefit from that repurchase for the entire quarter. Also note that we resumed our ongoing practice of buying back shares to offset dilution during the last few weeks of December.", "Cash flow from operations was $469 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016, up roughly 4% from last year. Working capital was a use of cash during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2016, as it was during the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2015. The first half of the fiscal year typically requires a seasonal net investment in working capital that is then reduced during the second half of the fiscal year.", "Year-over-year, the comparison is favorable as we invested $143 million less cash in working capital during first half of fiscal 2016 than we did in the first half of fiscal 2015. Net CapEx for the first 26 weeks was $237 million and free cash flow was $231 million.", "Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $264 million in fiscal 2016 and $102 million in fiscal 2015. Certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with U.S. Foods and from 2015 include items related to the proposed merger itself. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew by $179 million and free cash flow grew $237 million.", "Now, I'd like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2016 plan. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least the remainder of the fiscal year. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparisons this year more challenging. Fourth, we now expect CapEx to be near the lower end of the previously-stated $550 million to $600 million range. Finally, we expect a normalized tax rate of 36% to 37% over the remaining 26 weeks.", "In summary, we had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from the improved underlying business performance. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve our fiscal 2016 financial objectives and our three-year plan, including effectively managing deflation over the near term and increasing our focus on expenses.", "We continue to aggressively review every part of the company, looking for ways to reduce costs. Additionally, we have put in place some more rigorous process for managing expenses, including how we prioritize spending and focus investment on areas or projects that improve our ability to serve the customer better.", "And finally, we took advantage of continued lower fuel prices to increase the amount of fuel we locked in over the next 12 months. I feel good about our ability to achieve the first year target of our three-year plan, and we are working hard to be as aggressive as possible in identifying incremental opportunities to exceed our Investor Day targets.", "Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster.", "Your first question comes from the line of Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning. So, question on local cases. With local cases up about 3% in the quarter, I'm hoping you can provide some color here in terms of new customer growth versus higher share of wallet for existing customers? And over time, do you think you can grow local cases in excess of the market rate?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Zack, it's Bill. I'll start and let Tom kind of give you some color from his perspective. We've historically been able to take share year-in and year-out and we do that both on the local side of the business as well as the corporate side of the business. So, yeah, I would expect that we would continue to take share.", "Obviously, what Joel referred to in his comments is we're trying to do that in a more disciplined way as we go forward here, so that we give more of a flow through to the bottom line. The way I would look at the local case growth is I talked about the lever of accelerated local case growth. The context there is we've had, I think, seven quarters in a row of local case growth, and the last few have been right around 2% or more. So that lever is relative to where we were in the last two years or three years or four years as we were going through a lot of our change and some pretty tough macro economics.", "So that 2% to 3% range, I think, is what we're targeting. I think there's going to be some quarters where we're at the lower end of that range and there will be some we're at the higher end of the range. I think 2% to 3% is very solid growth if you look at what the forecasts are for the industry. But I'll let Tom speak to generally where it's coming from.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, thank you, Bill. I would just add we are seeing strong trends in restaurant traffic and restaurant sales, so that's certainly helping. But we're really focused on promotional activity that actually drives new business.", "And also, if you think about some of the tools that we shared at the Investor Day around how we improve our penetration, we are seeing improved penetration with our local customers, driven primarily by some of those initiatives, whether it's some of the local products I've been talking about, some of the innovation we've launched, or even some of the additional services we're providing those local customers.", "So we see good performance coming out of them from a variety of areas and believe we'll continue to see that kind of growth.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. And just, you had discussed a more rigorous process towards expense management. Joel, I'm hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on this in terms of potential focus areas and whether this would be above and beyond what you laid out at Investor Day.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. So couple of comments on that. Number one, the way I think about those types of costs, and I think we've talked about this at other places, we think about it from the standpoint of processes, from people, from technologies, from the types of investments that we put into our company, again, in terms of how we think about prioritizing items. So in other words, one of the key things I called out in here is the ability to really prioritize and then focus on those spends that are going to drive the, again, ultimately what's better for our customers.", "And so I think the \u2013 some of those things that we put in place, for example, are different committees to review and focus on technology spend, for example, and the ways to have, again, a very tight process for making sure that we're focusing on those projects that drive, again, the best results primarily and focused on the customer. So, I would say, I mean, again, there's a lot of rigor around that.", "And in terms of your \u2013 second part of your question, again, all I can really say to that I think is that we certainly will continue to focus on driving that, certainly with the deflation we're experiencing and the fact that our gross profit dollars are harder to come by. That increased focus on expenses is important. And so, again, as I mentioned I think in my script, that's certainly an area we're going to continue to focus on and certainly look to drive incremental improvements over and above our targets.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think, if I could just add there, Zack, to Joel's comments maybe a little more of a historical perspective. I mean this company has always managed expenses very well, both operationally and corporate. Now, over the last three years, four years, five years, we've invested a lot, in particular on the corporate side, technology, processes as Joel mentioned, commercial activities beginning to end supply chains, so a lot of those investments have been made over the last several years to create this path to transformation that we feel the company needs to go through in which we're pretty far down the road on.", "What you're seeing today and what you've seen in the last few quarters is we're beginning to get the benefits of a lot of those investments. So I would expect that the trajectory of that expense, as it's already happened, will flatten out. To Joel's point, we'll continue to get better and better at sequencing and prioritizing spend relative to customer needs and relative to what we need to deliver for our shareholders.", "I'd say, the one last opportunity we have, particularly in the field, is to be just more consistent in our execution. And we still see plenty of opportunity there. So, again, historically, we've done a good job, but what we're really telling you here is we think there's opportunity, both operationally as well as on the corporate side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just a follow-up on, I think there was a comment on deflation making gross profit dollars a little bit harder to come by, but it was also a gross margin benefit from a rate standpoint. Can you just elaborate on how deflation impacted the P&L as the quarter progressed? And if it's going to continue, do you anticipate any change in the way it impacts the business?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, deflation impacts the P&L. I don't know that there was a big sequential impact, a lot of variable around the sequential impact as the quarter progressed. What we're saying is we saw a pickup from the first quarter to the second quarter, we're seeing some similar trends here in January. And we kind of felt mathematically that would begin the wrap. We began to see this, if you recall, back in March and then the fourth quarter of last year when the inflation fell off. So we thought just from a wrapping perspective that we would see a little more \u2013 little less deflation as we got into the second half of the fiscal year. And I would say what we're telling you today is it's still there and we probably will expect to see it at least through the end of the quarter.", "It affects you in different ways, obviously. On the positive side, generally when our costs go down, we are able to pass that along to our customers. And that's good for them, especially as they are dealing with some of their labor challenges. Your percentages look better, so certainly it contributed to the gross margin expansion.", "But the reality is, it's not a great environment because you end up with fewer dollars to pay your expenses with. So to Joel's other point, when you have this level of deflation, it just reinforces the importance of managing our expenses very tightly.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. And as an unrelated follow-up, I know there were some comments about eCommerce. Can you remind us where the current perpetration is as it relates to sales and how you think about that as a driver of the business going forward?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. So regarding the eCommerce work we have been doing, we've been very focused on our mobility solution. So think about it as an online ordering tool where our customers can use iPad or type device or their phone to order. We've been piloting this across the last couple of quarters. We now are in most of our operating companies with at least some of the customers in some of our districts and so we're going to be expanding it now to the rest of the country and more of a full deployment.", "We continue to see improved usage of the tool, but I'd say today we're still in the low, probably 9%, 8%, 9% of the orders going through that process. But we're seeing basically double digit improvement each quarter as we roll this. So the feedback has been very positive, both from our own associates who also use the tool, and from our customers. So we believe we are well on our way to significant increases in adoption and ultimately, a lot more of the orders being placed using that tool.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning and good quarter. Back to the gross profits. So, just sequentially, they grew better even as sales got worse because of accelerated deflation. So I've heard the explanations around mix and so forth, but at least from my view, it looks like the deflation is at least kind of benign. I mean I know it becomes a headwind. But is there some element to sticky pricing where when inflation was increasing the last three years, it's tougher distributors to pass that through all at once. And is there some element where to some degree it doesn't have to come down quite as fast or do you think everybody is just chasing the business and passing it through right away?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Andy, and thank you. You covered a lot there. Look, I think \u2013 as I said, I believe the deflation, as you look at gross margin, i.e., the percent to sales is clearly helping. However, as we've said very consistently over the years, it's not an ideal environment to be in. If you look at this business historically, our customers generally are able to pass along a couple of points of inflation to their consumers year-in and year-out, and they generally do.", "So to one of your points, what you're seeing here a little bit is some of the recovery, what we gave up. When we were dealing with 5 points to 6 points of inflation, you can only pass along so much of that so quickly and it's only appropriate to pass along so much of that so quickly. So when you have some deflationary trends, mathematically, it helps you a little bit. Perhaps there's situations where you can bring your prices down a little slower, but ultimately, it's an incredibly competitive environment. So we're out there competing for that business every day and we want to do right by our customers. So I wouldn't put a lot of weight on that.", "I just think we're doing a very good job managing it. I've seen different cycles of deflation here over the last \u2013 you don't know how many years, but a lot of years \u2013 and this is by far and away the best we've ever managed it. And I think it goes back to what Tom covered, and I'll let him speak again. We are actively \u2013 we've been working on several commercial initiatives here for the last two years, three years, four years, whether it's segmentation, back to basics, revenue management, category management. These are all things that are allowing us to be more laser like in terms of how we work with our customers and bring more consistency to our pricing. There's more to do there, so I would just say I think we're actually managing it quite well.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, Bill, the only thing I would add is we've talked about the impact of the category management efforts we've been embarking on over the last few years. That continues to be a significant driver for us. And we've also shared with you all the importance of our Sysco brand growth and we are very focused on that Sysco brand because we know that not only is it a great quality product for our customers, but obviously, there are margin benefits for Sysco as well. And so I think really that's just one additional thing I'd add, if it helps.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And I wouldn't underestimate this mix. We don't have to grow the local faster than the corporate. I mean, I think corporate still grew a little bit faster than local this quarter, but we bring more value to the street customers. We're able to leverage our Sysco brand offerings in a broader way with our local case growth. And so if you go back to Investor Day and some of our commentary there, that first lever of accelerating local case growth and if we can keep it in that 2% to 3% range, that's a very powerful lever for the throughput or the flow through, if you will, to the bottom line of the company.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you. Can I just follow up briefly on the category management that seems to be driving profits nicely? I think earlier on it was really focused for you guys on your vendors and some of the things you were doing there to bring down cost. It sounds like it's more focused now on getting it into the sales side of the business and bringing it to the restaurants. Am I hearing that right as well?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Well, I'd say, yes. The initial wave you go through and you are obviously doing all the hard work and heavy lifting around the categories, selecting the right products and the right partners to do business with. Now that we're deeply into that and we've been through all the categories, the majority of them, now we're very much focused on optimizing what we have. So, you've heard us talk about innovative products.", "We've had some innovation that has been out over the last couple of quarters now that are starting to drive some incremental benefits for our customers and obviously for us. You are also starting to do much longer range planning with a lot of these supplier partners. So it's become more of the way we operate. And I guess based on that or because of that, we're seeing the kind of consistent year-over-year benefits. While maybe not as great as they were in the early days as we started at, we're still seeing consistent benefits from that work.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Ed.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hey, Bill, can I just start with maybe a big picture question? So last quarter, you sort of walked us through how the underlying business was better than the bottom line results, so to show it, right? And that was, I think, more around like corporate costs and stuff. And now this quarter you've got, it's like your strongest EBIT growth quarter in sort of recent memory. Despite deflation, you've got case growth and better profit per case and lower expense per case that are all lining up. Do you feel that you've kind of reached that inflection point that you were hinting at last quarter? I guess what's the big picture takeaway from this quarter, if there is one at this point.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Ed, I think it's a little bit like golf. We got a little bit more out of it this quarter than we did in the first quarter. I think when I talked about that first quarter, that's when we really talked more about the U.S. Broadline than we have in the past. I wanted you and the other investors to understand the quality of the underlying quarter.", "I think part of what we're seeing, we've done some work on this, is the trajectory of the corporate spend coming out of last year, coming out of the proposed merger that ultimately was terminated, we still had some \u2013 and we still do \u2013 we still had some trajectory of our spend here at corporate, in particular on the technology side, in particular on some of the areas that Tom's speaking to with the digital and mobile platforms. So those comparisons were not quite as tough in the second quarter as they were in the first quarter. So our corporate expense increase is a little bit less acute.", "We got a little more margin improvement, as you can see on the gross margin side, even though we did see more deflation. And perhaps that helped us a little bit in the short term, but we also managed, I think, a little bit better. And you saw better cost management, I think, operationally as well. We're right around that flat cost per case right now. Fuel helped us a little bit there, but. So I just think everything got a little bit better and I just think this quarter is somewhat more reflective of really the quality of the earnings that we've seen.", "Now, look at it, what I would encourage you to do is look at the first half I spoke to. And what I see there is I see 4% operating income with improving trends. And that's kind of how we're looking at it. So we think we're in a good place for the first year piece of our three-year goal. Joel can speak to that, but I think we talked about hitting 20% to 30% of our goal here in the first year.", "And we've got more work to do to hit or exceed the rest of that goal, both as it relates to continuing to address the deflation, in particular, grow those cases locally the way we are and have been. But we've got some more work to do on the expense side as well, and you've heard us allude to that here. So I wouldn't quite call it an inflection point, but I would call it a validation of what I talked about in the first quarter.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, and just couple of quick follow-ups. One, just on case growth, do you think weather sort of helped case growth out at all? And then a follow-up on deflation. The last period that we saw more meaningful deflation, profit per case was down. And it doesn't sound \u2013 like it sounds like this period, you think you can sort of manage through that without seeing it? And I just want to confirm that that's how you're thinking about things.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't think weather played that large a role. It's always hard for us to talk about good weather. December was relatively mild, so it might have helped a little bit. I would tell you (38:04) as far as this quarter goes, we finally had winter. We had it in the Mid-Atlantic area here a couple of weeks ago. So that's hitting us a little bit our last week of January/first week of February. But so far nothing crazy on the weather side this quarter either.", "I just think I'll let the other guys chime in here. I think on the gross profit, look, deflation's a very challenging environment to manage in terms of growing your gross profit dollars. And I just think we're doing a better job there for the reasons that Tom's taken you through. But the reality is we grew 3.4%, which is not 4%.", "To Joel's point, it was better than that when you adjust for currency. So I just think a lot of these commercial initiatives that we've been talking about for the last two years, three years, four years, they're in different stages of development and maturation, and you're beginning to see the benefits of them. But it is definitely a challenging environment, and that's why we're just being a little bit cautious in our wording as it relates to the second half of the year.", "Joel, you want to add anything?", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I think the only thing I would just add to that in terms of the way we think about that is, again, Bill said it. The headwind is there, but the combination of solid volume growth and some of the margin expansion that's caused it coming from some of the initiatives that Tom's talked about, again, the category management, the brand \u2013 the brand within our local case growth. So in other words, we're growing our local cases and our brand within that is growing. And so that's all positive. And so, I think at the end of the day, again, certainly obviously we say we'd certainly love to take a little bit of inflation to pass even more of that through, but I think those are kind of the key levers that we think about as we combat inflation. I think we've done a pretty good job of it.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, and we've talked a lot about local, and we need to, because, I mean, that really is what's driving a lot of this along with the initiatives. But we also grew the corporate businesses this quarter as well, and we grew it in a profitable manner. So we actually feel good about the overall quality of the case growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Your line is open. Meredith Adler, your line is open.", "Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO capital. Your line is open.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Lots of questions on gross margin. But I was just curious, the factors that you called out, category management, local case growth, your private brand, deflation, is that order of magnitude the right way to think about it? I mean, do you kind of go item by item of those four factors and say here's kind of what the impact was? And just wondering if you're willing to share any more detail with us on those.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Kelly, just to be clear. Is that the way we think about what?", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "The impact of those factors on gross margin. Category management, the local case growth, the private label penetration, and the deflation.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, well, again, just for no other reason than to make me feel good, I think about gross margin, but I also think even more about gross profit dollars. So we're trying to address both here.", "You pay your bills with the dollars. I think on your point on the margin, certainly deflation of this magnitude is meaningful. It's impossible to quantify what that is, but we would be less than genuine if we didn't say that was contributing to some of the margin improvement. But I would quickly go to the other things we talked about here today, which is the importance of local case growth.", "Again, it doesn't have to be faster than the corporate. It just needs to be significant. The importance of growing the brand, and that's easier to do when you're growing your local cases. And the maturation of the category management work that we're doing, along with some of the work that Tom is continuing to develop here on revenue management.", "But I'll \u2013 you could talk to ten people or 100 people in Sysco and probably get a little bit different answer on that question. so I'll let Tom and Joel jump in here.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Well, again, I think the question was really more around is the prioritization of that the way we look at it. I think we look at all of them coming together. At the end of the day, this local customer, if we are meeting or exceeding their needs, we're going to get the kind of growth that's required there. And we're focused on a lot of initiatives that, in fact, help them be successful.", "And I know we said that a few times, but I think what is important for you to take away is that the more they're successful, and therefore the more we're successful with them, that is a big lever on our business, because of the \u2013 what we bring to them and the percentage of their business that is, in fact, Sysco brand, and the way that we partner with them. So I think I would say they all come together, and that's what makes the impact that you're seeing. I don't know that it's one necessarily higher than the other. It's really more about making them work together.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And I think the other point that Joel's made, and I'll let him make it again, is just obvious point: we've had some challenges here in the last few years, but to keep the right spread, if you will, between the gross profit growth and the expense growth.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I think that's the other point I would continue to emphasize. As inflation goes up and down, as our gross profit dollars are driven by the things we've talked about, again to Bill \u2013 the point that Bill just made, one of the really strong focuses we have is to drive the gap between gross profit dollar growth and expense growth, which again, certainly this quarter we did a good job of, because, yeah, whether we have more inflation or less inflation one way or the other, that spread is really important to us, which is why we're going to continue to keep driving certainly on the gross profit dollar growth, but focus on the expenses as well.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then, I guess, in terms of expense growth, what was the impact of technology spend this quarter on your expenses.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't think that we historically have really gotten that detail, Kelly. What I would tell you is we still have some expense growth here at the corporate side. It's planned. And virtually all of it's on the technology side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi there. I don't know if this is something that you'd be prepared to answer, but it would help, just because if and when we do return to an inflationary environment, it's just something to keep in mind in terms of puts and takes on a gross margin. So I guess the question is what percent of your sales are priced at cost plus a percentage markup versus a cost plus fixed penny per case? Because obviously, I mean, in fixed penny per case customer, you're going to be benefiting in a deflationary environment from a gross margin perspective.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Karen, good morning. I would just say that you can presume that when we talk about our corporate customers, those large customers, those are all on some type of a cost contract. Some are markups, some are margin, some lines are done dollar per piece, whatever, dollar per pound. And on the local side, a lot of that is priced by the MA (45:36). Some of it is contractual, but we have and we don't plan on getting into a lot of detail on how we price customers.", "Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then I guess just switching gears, two questions. I guess the first is what do you kind of cut back on in terms of CapEx this year in terms of your coming in at the low end of the range? And then the second question I had is just obviously your stock is reacting to your strong results this morning. I'm just curious how you think about the remaining buyback in light of the fact that, obviously, stock was at a better entry point during the quarter than it is now?", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So I'll take first one and then I'll maybe clarify your question on the second one. The first part of the CapEx, I don't know that I'd really think about it as something we're cutting back on. I think the way I would just say it is we target our CapEx spend. It's not based on some fixed number that we need to achieve or not achieve, but it's really truly driven by the needs of the business.", "And so I think the way I would just think about that is that as we've kind of talked about before, we have a pretty rigorous process in terms of identifying and prioritizing our capital spending needs. And I would just say it to you this way that the way we look at the required spend this year for what our business is needing just happens to fall near the lower end of that range. So again, I don't necessarily look at our target as something that we have to achieve our some number we have to get to. It's just based on the needs of our business and we have the ability to flex as it relates to that.", "And then the second \u2013 Bill, do you want to add anything?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me take a shot at the second one. If I don't hit it, Karen, clarify it for us. First of all, it's nice to have a quarter beat. So, it's nice to see the stock reacting. Our experience is it'll take two days or three days for things to kind of level out in terms of how investors see the quarter. We've announced our intention to \u2013 we have done the $1.5 billion that needs to be sold, as Joel said. And today it would still be our intention to do the remainder of the program next year. So if things were to change, we will let you know, but right now, that's still our intention.", "I would just reiterate, though, going back to the first part of your question, we're always looking to invest in our business. And we'll continue to do that in a way that supports the disciplined growth that we talked about. Modestly growing the dividend continues to be very important and we continue to look for good solid strategic acquisitions. So we're looking at all four of those opportunities, but I'm sitting here today two hours into this thing, I think we haven't changed any plans.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Good morning. I wonder if you can give us an update on how things are going at SYGMA on improving profitability there? And also, just a little more detail on what you're talking about there for the fourth quarter comparisons, why fourth quarter is going to be a difficult comparison for you?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'll speak briefly and certainly let Tom give you a little more color. SYGMA, as we've said, is in somewhat of a turnaround mode and we are continuing to see some better trends there as it relates to the customer mix and the expense management and that kind of thing. I would tell you, there's still plenty of work to go there. But we're encouraged with the beginning some of trends that we're seeing, but we're not there yet.", "I'll let Tom take the rest of SYGMA and then I'll let Joel talk to you about the fourth quarter", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "The only thing I'd add on SYGMA is we're very focused on specific customers and profitability, as well as improving our operational excellence in that business. And so, the combination of those two things is how we're going to improve and get this thing back on track.", "We've had, certainly over the last year, some challenges regarding drivers and driver retention, which is something that we've come out of and we're in a much better place now than we probably six months ago. But it's really those two areas. Making sure we've got the right customer mix and also that we're operating at the highest levels.", "Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Okay.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, sure, Mark, it's Joel. The question on the fourth quarter. I think the comment there really relates to the fact that last year in the fourth quarter our adjusted operating income grew nearly 6% and certainly we picked up nearly $30 million of operating income from the prior year. And so I think the comment was really focused around the \u2013 again, I often talk about growth on top of growth, and certainly as I mentioned in my part of the script, I said we're certainly feel very good about how we're looking towards achieving our fiscal 2016 planned objectives. But, again, it's really more of a call out of the fact that the fourth quarter last year, we had quite a strong performance, and that's where the comparatives are up against what we're referring to.", "Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the Meredith Adler with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi, this is Sean (50:50) on for Meredith. How's it going, guys?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good.", "Unknown Speaker", "I have a question on lower commodity costs. And to what extent that's maybe resulting in restaurants, maybe investing some of that into being more promotional versus them using it to offset high labor expense? I think that's been somewhat of a driver of case growth to some extent.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That would be hard for us to assess and probably not even appropriate. I think Tom sees more customers than I do, but I see a few, and I think this labor cost thing is at the top of mind for them right now. I know it's been the subject of some recent industry meetings. And I think that's where it's helping them. But, Tom, do you have anything to add to that?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "No, not really. I can't say there's a big theme around more promotional activity that I'm seeing. They have lots of concerns out there right now, not the least of which is the labor environment.", "Unknown Speaker", "Sure. Makes sense. Another question I have too is just on the driver or maybe the drivers of non-Broadline inflation, just because it seems like there was deflation at Broadline at about negative 1.9%, which is approximately 80% of business. So I'm just wondering what's kind of driving the inflation for the remainder of the business?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think what you're saying really is the deflation at the U.S. Broadline's driving the deflation. And some of our other businesses, to Karen's question on cost, SYGMA has more of the cost per piece, that type of fee, type of pricing, so that's not going to be impacted as much. Some of our other guest supply, different type of product line altogether, so Canada not as much. So I think all we're saying is the U.S. Broadline is 80% of our revenue stream, and that's where the bulk of the deflation is.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, great. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to circle back a second on deflation. Bill, you said earlier, I know that something to the effect of deflation, of course, remaining a headwind. You initially thought it might subside kind of in the back half of the year, but still kind of there. So just to clarify, are you guys thinking for the next quarter or two, that kind of very similar levels to what you are seeing today, which I guess is similar to the quarter that was just reported? Or do you think that it could get a bit more of a headwind before then moderating?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Vinnie, I wish I knew. I think all we're signaling is we think it's going to be with us at least a quarter or two longer, at least. And it was almost two points in the U.S. Broadline this past quarter. I don't know that it's going to get a whole lot worse than that. We'll just have to see. But I think the real message, and let me be as clear as I can be, is that I think probably if I'd been talking to you, and I was six months ago, I would have thought by the fourth quarter we would've been back more to neutral, and that's really not our assessment right now. But I'm not necessarily saying it's going to get worse. I'm just saying that it's probably not going to get a whole lot better for another quarter or two.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Okay. That's fair enough. And maybe just one quick follow-up. You mentioned about the private brands a couple of times, also some of the newer fresh mix. Just kind of any updates either qualitatively or hopefully quantitatively the current percent of the mix where you may see that going, maybe some new categories that are coming on board?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think as long as we continue to grow the local cases, and continue to, even as we go through the second round now with CatMan with a lot of our suppliers and we work more and more on innovation, that type of thing, that gives us an opportunity to partner with our suppliers with both certainly their brand, but also ours. So, it's hard to move a number, but you'll see in the attachments from the earnings release that we had a nice move this quarter. So I don't \u2013 I'm not going to try to predict how much more it could go up, but there's a high correlation between local case growth and brand movement. And Tom can give you some color on that as well.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, the specific numbers, that I think were communicated, and for U.S. Broadline, this is total U.S. Broadline, it was about 36.5% of the mix. And for the local business, it was 43.5%. And the local, it was up about 43 basis points. So we continue to see growth there. We believe it is a differentiator for us, and it's something that our customers also see value in, both price value, but I think also from a quality perspective.", "I think the other thing that Bill just mentioned, we're doing more innovative work. And as we do work with our supplier partners on Sysco brand innovation, that's going to help continue to contribute to these numbers. And I think I mentioned in the first couple of quarters, we had 16 items that we launched, basically, innovative items in the marketplace, and these are all generally Sysco brand items. Not all of them, but a lot of them are. And that'll continue to be a focus for us going forward.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. And I would just add that, I mean, this falls into the category of the disciplined, driving disciplined growth and profitable case growth, and certainly across both on the local side and again our multi-unit side. So, again, that disciplined approach on growing profitable cases certainly encapsulates everything that we've discussed here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about the ongoing benefit from fuel in terms of the net benefit. If you can comment on the actual earnings impact in Q2 year-to-date and also your outlook for fuel, maybe in the back half of the year after you've netted out the hedges that you've got in place and along with the impact of lower spot prices. So any kind of quantification would be appreciated. Thanks.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, I think from a quantity perspective, I mean, we look at that as a couple of pennies per case on the fuel side in terms of the impact on what that is. Obviously, as I talked about in my area, certainly we're taking advantage of the fuel prices where they are today, and buying. We typically have executed forward buys and we continue to do that.", "And in fact, we continue to increase the percentage of our fuel consumption that has really brought a head on. And so that's certainly something, again, that we see. And I \u2013 we're not in this thing in terms of kind of speculating on fuel prices. It's something we certainly take advantage of where we have an opportunity both from a cost certainty perspective and then what we feel is just a good solid fuel prices. So, again, as I mentioned in my script, we're certainly \u2013 a fairly sizable portion of the fuel we've bought forward for over the next year. And so certainly we anticipate some continued benefit there.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay. But on a year-to-date basis, how would you say the pennies per case improved and how does that translate into earnings?", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, again, it's pretty consistent. Again, as I pointed out, we think of it as about a couple pennies per case, that's impacted overall.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. So wanted to touch on private brand and gross. When you think about the ability to use the private brand portfolio to drive share. And I know there's a lot of things that you're offering to your customers, but just maybe isolate that one. How effective can that be at bringing on new customers? And I guess part of that is the inertia that they might have to the brands that they're using today. And do you think you're using those brands as effectively as you could? Are there things that can be done maybe a little bit differently to drive \u2013 to use those brands to drive some increased share gains? Any thoughts, particularly from Tom on that?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "So I would maybe reiterate a few comments I made and maybe add a few points. So the Sysco brand, if you think about the Sysco brand, it's a value for a couple of reasons. One, generally, the cost to our customers is a little less than some of the national brands. So there's a natural benefit for them. But more importantly, we're very focused on the quality of these items. And I had mentioned innovation. So we're always looking to ensure that the Sysco brand items are, in fact, not only value added, meaning they bring increased value to the customer, but that they're also driving kind of the base business components that these customers need.", "So I'd say, we're getting everything we can. I think we feel pretty good about where we're at today. We feel like certainly we're not out of runway. But I think the more we can continue to focus on quality products, bringing innovation to those items, and making sure that we keep them in front of our customers. And we use \u2013 I think we talked about it at the Investor Day, the business review process that we use. It's a great way for us to actually do cuttings of our products, allowing them to see Sysco brand and compare that to something else they might be using. And it's how we spend a lot of that time is to help those customers see the value that's there and the opportunity that they have to improve their overall profitability by using the brand.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "All right. And then maybe for Bill, if you think about some bigger secular trends, right? So local, private brand, CatMan. I mean you would think, and I know this isn't fully built in your plan, but you would think that there may be a good chance here for secular gross margin rate to be up pretty consistently. Obviously, if the top line is healthy, GP dollars could grow at a nice rate, maybe even higher than what you've targeted over the last three. How do you think about that?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm all for it, but it's a little early to make that call, I think, John. So I think your thinking always is logical. We're six months into this three-year plan. I would just reiterate some things we talked about in September.", "The overall industry, I would say, the overall environment and the outlook for our customers is better today than it was two years or three years ago. Now, it goes up and down by quarter. You can actually see in some of the stuff when the stock market goes down, some of the NRA numbers fall off the next month or next quarter, so. But I think if you look at it secularly and go back two years or three years, we're in a better place. So that's a positive. It's still incredibly an acutely competitive world out there, so we need to be very responsive to that.", "And I would just echo what I've been trying to articulate here over the last two years or three years, but in particular the last several months post the merger termination, we're extremely well positioned today because of all the work that we've done over the last two years, three years, four years on the commercial side to compete effectively, do the right thing by our customers, but also grow in a disciplined way, as Joel talks about and manage our margins. So, if you look at those four levers, we're talking about improving how we manage it. Ideally, we'll at least hold margin over the next two years or three years. Right now we're up. Hopefully, we will grow it, but I certainly feel we're much better positioned to manage it well than where we were two years, three years, four years ago.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, thank you. At this point, just a quick one for me. A follow-up on the fuel question. I think you kind of have a cost of fuel that's both embedded in your cost of sales and your operating expenses. So correct me if I'm wrong about that. But my question was, your suppliers that deliver food to you, how much fuel savings maybe was embedded over the past couple of quarters and what you anticipate over the next couple of quarters just that their delivery costs are less to you and therefore your price of product could be lower and that could actually be helping your cost of goods told, if you thought about it in that way.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, it's a good question, John. What we're speaking to is really our outbound cost of fuel. It's a little harder and we really don't get into that level of detail in terms of our components of our cost of goods. But let me say it this way, lower fuel is good. Okay? It's generally good for multiple reasons.", "One, on the margin generally people get some more discretionary income and they'll spend it, historically spend it more going out to eat. Now, I will say this, we really haven't seen a lot of that until perhaps lately and we don't have a lot of hard data on that. So the most powerful thing on the fuel is to the extent it translates to greater discretionary income and the consumer uses it to go out to eat, that's a good thing for us. I haven't seen quite as much of that, but we're hopeful that we'll see more.", "But, no, you are absolutely right, it helps us on the cost of goods, and to Joel's point, it helps us on the outbound. We kind of weight average the outbound. So it's definitely a modest tailwind and we're taking advantage of it and hopefully it'll stay that way.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian. Your line is open.", "Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Yeah, just a quick one. You mentioned that the competitive environment \u2013 or the environment is very competitive. And I'm just wondering has that changed any over the last few months? Is it pretty similar? Because obviously you picked up some share, so I'm just wondering if you've noticed any change there or who you think you're taking market share from? Is it broad-based or maybe there's a regional or more national players that you're taking that share from?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "What we've been able to grow is, as I said historically, take share for many years. And certainly we've got the local case growth moving again here the last several quarters. We don't have the data for 2015. My sense is we probably have taken some share. I think a lot of the larger multi-regionals are doing well.", "And so if I were to conjecture, which is always a dangerous thing on calls like this, my sense is that some of the better operative larger folks are taking share, and it may be coming from some of the smaller players. But the bottom line, I think, in this business is good operators are going to take share. Large, small, good restaurant operators are going to continue to grow and do well, whether they're independent or corporate owned.", "And so I think our overall point of view would be the competitive environment remains very acute. It remains very similar to what we've seen the last two years or three years. And the best operators, both in terms of the customer base as well as on the distribution side are going to do the best.", "Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone.", "This morning Sysco reported strong third quarter financial results. Our performance reflects both the commitment of our 52,000 associates to supporting the success of our customers and the improving execution of our strategy and three-year plan initiatives.", "During the quarter Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of 4% while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to 1.5%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of $60 million or 16% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew 15% to $0.46 per share.", "These results were achieved with the benefit of favorable weather conditions and an earlier Easter holiday compared to the prior-year third quarter. Consumer confidence data points, while still favorable compared to a few years ago, were somewhat uneven and tracked the volatile financial market activity quite closely.", "Lower fuel prices were likely a net positive, as the impact of consumer spending benefits and reduced delivery costs offset to some degree the economic slowdown we are experiencing in energy-driven economies in certain parts of Texas and in Montana, North Dakota, and Alberta Canada.", "Turning to specific restaurant industry data, the overall sales trends remain mixed. According to the National Restaurant Association, restaurant sales have been uneven during the first three months of 2016 after steadily rising throughout 2015. Both NPD and KNAPP-TRACK have also shown recent traffic and sales declines. However, even with this recent shopping industry performance, the overall trend remains generally favorable for our customers, as illustrated by the U.S. Census Bureau sales data for the quarter rising 1% above the prior quarter, representing the 11th consecutive quarter of restaurant sales growth.", "Moving to our results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, I'm very pleased with the increasing momentum in our business. For the nine-month period ending in March, we delivered the following results. Total broadline cases grew 3.3% and local cases grew 2.9%. Sales were up 1.2% despite being adversely impacted by both deflation and foreign exchange headwinds.", "Gross profit dollars grew 3.3% and gross margin increased 35 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased $100 million or about 8% compared to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 10%. These results are in line with our three-year planned financial objectives, to grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million and to grow earnings per share faster than operating income.", "Our progress towards the achievement of these financial objectives is being driven by focusing on the following four key levers: accelerating local case growth; improving gross margin; leveraging supply chain costs; and reducing administrative costs.", "Regarding the reduction of administrative costs, we recently began to implement a workforce reduction of approximately 1,200 positions. We've taken a very thoughtful approach to this difficult process by focusing on prioritizing all existing work more effectively, reducing layers of management, and expanding spans of control. We believe our approach will allow us to continue supporting our customers with a high level of service, as evidenced by the fact that we are not reducing the number of marketing associates or warehouse and delivery associates who directly support our customers.", "During the quarter we also announced our proposed acquisition of the Brakes Group, a $5 billion European foodservice distributor with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France, and Sweden. We're very excited about this opportunity as we will inherit an excellent leadership team, a business whose customer-centric strategy and culture is very similar to Sysco's, and 15,000 highly capable associates. We expect this acquisition will provide a solid trajectory of EBITDA growth over time and excellent platform for further acquisitions in Europe. Equally important, this transaction will not distract us from driving out our three-year plan in our existing business. We continue to target a June or July closing.", "As we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level. We have delivered consistent local case growth for the past two years, expanded gross margins for four consecutive quarters, reduced adjusted cost per case in the field, and put plans into place that will reduce administrative expenses. These actions and related results reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives as we move forward.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my remarks regarding the third quarter by providing an update on some of the initiatives related to our three-year plan and how they've continued to positively impact our business results.", "As we have mentioned a few times before, our insights-based approach to understanding, meeting our customer's needs, continues to guide our efforts and is clearly driving improved performance. For example, during the third quarter, our U.S. broadline operations delivered case growth of 3.6%, including local case growth of 3.4%, gross profit dollar growth of 4.8%, including an improvement in margin of 39 basis points. And for operating expense, we reduced our adjusted cost per case by $0.08, or $0.03 on a neutral fuel price basis. And we had operating income growth of 11.5%.", "We are driving increased case growth through a variety of sales and marketing initiatives that are designed to deliver value to our customers while providing a more consistent experience of doing business with Sysco. I'm pleased to report that the third quarter represents the eighth straight quarter of local case growth.", "As you know, improving gross margin is another key driver of Sysco achieving our three-year targets. And our strong performance this quarter indicates that we are making progress towards delivering our long-term objectives.", "During the quarter, we delivered solid growth in key center of plate categories such as beef, pork, and poultry. And we continued our growth in produce, reinforcing the benefits driven from a focus on fresh. We also saw a solid increase of more than 50 basis points in Sysco brand sales with our local customers. These efforts combined with other initiatives such as our ongoing work in category and revenue management as well as the impact of deflation contributed to an increase in U.S. broadline gross margin of approximately 40 basis points, the fourth quarter in a row with gross margin expansion.", "These improvements are especially noteworthy as we've been able to manage through the current deflationary environment fairly well due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve local case growth as a percentage of our mix as well as our continued focus on our category management process. Separately, the operating expense performance during the quarter was particularly strong. We limited total adjusted expense growth to only 1.5% despite case growth of more than 3% and, as mentioned, we reduced our overall cost per case in the U.S. broadline by $0.03 excluding the impact of fuel prices.", "From a supply chain perspective, we continue to make good progress towards our goals to improve overall service to our customers, while driving higher productivity in our operations through our continuous improvement process. We've also seen good progress through a series of indirect spend initiatives. And while there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends and we are targeting a continuation of this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year.", "In conjunction with the series of initiatives to support our long-term strategy, we are implementing a new market structure that reduces the number of U.S. broadline geographic markets from eight to six, effective at the beginning of our fiscal 2017 year. Each market team will continue to be led by a market president and include key functional leaders across finance, merchandising, supply chain and human resources to provide support to our operating companies to help to drive solid execution of the various corporate initiatives.", "We believe that the work we've done in building the capability of the organization through the functional structure over the past two years makes this the right time for us to evolve our structure. This change will reduce overall administrative costs in the field, drive efficiency through a more standardized approach and improve execution to our customers.", "In conjunction with this restructuring, I'm pleased to announce the promotion of three strong Sysco leaders. Greg Bertrand has been appointed Senior Vice President, U.S. Foodservice Operations, with responsibility for all U.S. broadline operating companies. We also announced that Scott Sonnemaker has been named Senior Vice President, International Foodservice Operations, Americas, and Bill Goetz has been named Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing.", "These are just a few of the key priorities and changes that are positively impacting our operational and financial results. While we need continue to execute at a high level, I'm confident we are on the right path to achieve our long-term objectives.", "In summary, our customer and operational strategies are being executed well on the field and our headquarters teams are doing a terrific job of providing our organization with field-ready tools and processes that are enabling our success.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone.", "We had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, particularly solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management, achieved in an environment with continued deflation and currency headwinds. We continue to make solid progress towards our fiscal 2016 plan and our three-year goals.", "We grew sales in the third quarter by approximately 2% year over year, despite deflation of 0.4%. We saw continued deflation in center of the plate protein categories such as meat, seafood and poultry, as supply recovers from various events in 2015. This deflationary trend has been persistent over the past two quarters.", "Acquisitions increased sales by 0.9% while foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1% in the third quarter. U.S. dollar strength against the Canadian dollar was responsible for the vast majority of the foreign exchange impact. The negative impacts we have been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening as we began to wrap the initial decline in relative value of the Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, sales would have been up 3.1%.", "Turning to case growth, consistent with our three-year plan to achieve disciplined case growth, we had another quarter of strong performance. Total broadline case growth for the third quarter was 3.3% and local was also 3.3%. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year local case growth for the total broadline.", "Looking at gross profit and gross margins, we grew our gross profit at a solid 4.1%, while also continuing to see expansion in gross margins which grew by 34 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvement included category management, a more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, gross profit growth was 5%.", "During the third quarter, we had a few certain items that impacted our results. These include restructuring costs such as charges related technology changes, severance and professional fees of $60 million and about $10 million of acquisition financing costs. On a GAAP basis, without excluding these certain items and the comparable certain items from the prior year, our operating income grew 15% and our diluted earnings per share grew about 27%. The rest of my discussion will focus on the non-GAAP or adjusted for certain items results.", "Adjusted operating expense grew 1.5% during the quarter and by 2.4% on a constant currency basis. This increase was mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals and is partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending, reduced fuel costs and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in our reduced cost per case.", "As a result, adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $438 million, up 16% compared to the prior year and 17% on a constant currency basis. As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.6% compared to 33.9% in the prior year period. Both quarters' tax rates were positively impacted by the favorable resolution of state tax matters. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 10% and adjusted earnings per share grew 15%.", "Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2016, up approximately 15% from last year. Net working capital improved by about half a day during the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This was largely driven by improvements in both receivables and inventory.", "Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks was $348 million and free cash flow was $641 million. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $272 million in fiscal 2016 and $128 million in fiscal 2015. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods, and for 2015 include items related to the planning of the merger integration. Excluding the cash impact of certain items from both years, cash flow from operations grew $273 million and free cash flow grew $346 million.", "Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the remainder of the fiscal year. First, we're currently on track to hit our fiscal 2016 financial objectives. Second, we expect deflation to persist for at least another quarter. Third, we had a relatively strong fourth quarter last year, which will make fourth quarter comparisons this year more challenging. And, finally, we now expect CapEx for fiscal year to be approximately $500 million or approximately 1% of sales.", "During the quarter, we also completed a successful debt offering, the proceeds of which are to be used for the acquisition of Brakes that Bill mentioned earlier. The very attractive coupons associated with this financing, approximately 3% on a weighted average basis, represents both the strength of our balance sheet as well as impressive work by our team throughout the process.", "In addition, Sysco put in place hedges during the quarter that protect approximately half of the purchase price over the Brakes transaction against unfavorable movements and foreign exchange rates.", "In summary, we had a strong quarter led by continued momentum from improved underlying business performance, strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives for our three-year plan.", "We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a higher level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long-term. I feel confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives of our three-year plan and we will aggressively continue to look for incremental opportunities to exceed our goals.", "Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The first question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice quarter here. Just curious if you could talk about the local case growth; continues to accelerate. Maybe just, if you can, provide some historical perspective on when the last time it was this strong. Are you seeing it in both comp restaurant growth or new independent local customers coming into the mix? And then in terms of the private label penetration with that local segment, where do you think you can take that longer term?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Kelly, it's Bill. I'll start and I'll let Tom give you a little bit more color. I think in terms of historical context, this is by far the strongest quarter we've had over the last four or five years. And that's very encouraging and certainly something that is bringing the momentum of the business that both Tom and Joel talked about.", "So in terms of where it's coming from, I think it's the same answer as I would give you if you had asked about margin or even expenses at this point. It's coming from a lot of good work over the last few years on the commercial side of the business that Tom can give you a little more color on, and really good alignment I think with our leadership team throughout Sysco. And I would say this particular quarter, we acknowledged it, there were some tailwinds. And I don't like to talk about weather a lot. I think that the last two third quarters we've talked about weather. Two years ago we had a brutal winter at the beginning of the winter, and last year I think it was at the end of winter, and this year was a pretty mild winter. So I think that helped a little bit.", "With that said, I think I was also trying to get out there that the data out there right now is a little bit mixed in terms of overall industry growth. So I think we had some tailwinds that we took advantage of. But more than anything, I think it's more and more good execution of key initiatives (22:32) the commercial side over the last three, four years.", "On the brand \u2013 and I'll kick it to Tom real quick \u2013 these things tend to go together. When you're growing your business, you're creating differentiation at the customer level, and that's what the brand allows us to do. And so we've brought renewed focus on the brand over the last three years in conjunction with our category management work. And I think we're doing it the right way. And I don't know, we're not really chasing a number here, Kelly. I think what we're saying is the key to all of this is really growing those local cases. And as we do that, we should be able to grow the brand. I don't know that there's a particular percentage that we're trying to get to other than to utilize the brand as a way to differentiate ourselves more effectively. And let me kick it to Tom here and give you a little more color on that.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks, Bill. And I won't repeat a lot of what Bill said because I think he hit pretty clearly on what the key drivers are. Let me just add on the local case growth. You had asked about current customers and new customers. We spend a fair amount of time looking at what we call new sales, lost sales, and then penetration. And think about that as new customers, any customers that we may have lost some business at or where we've done a better job of selling more to those customers.", "And I would tell you that all of those metrics continue to head in the right direction as it relates to our local customers, meaning our new sales continue to be very strong. Our lost sales have declined a little bit over the past couple of quarters. And our penetration sales, which is what is delivering more to those current customers, has also been increasing. And that's a key metric for us because that tells us that we're improving in all those areas with our customers, our current customers, and making sure that we're continuing to satisfy their needs. So we feel good about all those metrics and where the business is heading.", "And then lastly, on the Sysco brand, the only thing I'd add to what Bill said is our focus \u2013 a lot of the category management focus is in fact driven towards that local customer. And based on that, the more we bring them differentiated solutions \u2013 we've talked about innovation in the last couple of quarters \u2013 is when we're bringing them new news and innovation, that actually helps us grow our Sysco brand because generally those products are in the Sysco brand lineup. So I think as Bill said, they go hand in hand, and I think this continued focus by us in bringing new and differentiated products to our customers is helping us grow that. And I would agree with Bill, we don't have a number per se that we're targeting. We know that it's important, and we continue to focus on it quarter-in and quarter-out.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from BB&T. Your line is now open.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Great, thanks and congratulations on the quarter. Bill, I just wanted to ask you on the sales count, the MAs [Marketing Associates] up and down the street. Is that up sequentially or year over year a little bit, or is the organization driving the good local penetration and general growth with the same head count on the sales side?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's roughly the same. I think the mix is a little different. We've put a lot of trainees over the last year and that's begun to level out. Tom, do you got anything?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "No, I think that's the big change. Our base MAs were very much flat versus the past year and this quarter. Actually because we've got good retention with our marketing associates, we're down a little bit in the number of trainees that we have out there because we just aren't using as many in the pipeline. But overall, we're driving these sales with our existing sales force.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The reason it can be flat, Andy, is because of some of the work that we've done over the last two or three years with the CRM tool, with some things we're doing in terms of territory management to be more rifle-like in terms of going after the business, and that will continue to be a point of emphasis in our sales strategy.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, that's an encouraging change, I think, from the way the business has historically operated. Do you think going forward, if you wanted to continue to keep this momentum going forward, you can at least leverage sales, get case growth, local case growth, in a multiple of \u2013 it sounds like you can. I just want to confirm how you think about that. It used to be a one-to-one relationship between sales head count and internal sales growth. It sounds like you've actually gotten to a point where maybe it's a lot better than that.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think it's a little better than that. I think you'll continue to see that.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "And the other question I just want is for Joel. On the $59 million net total restructuring costs, can you just tell us how much of that was accelerated depreciation related to SAP or anything else?", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I would say maybe about a quarter of that was, I think even a little less than that. There was a part of that that was \u2013 it's that stuff then what I'll call a one-time write-off of projects that were in process that were associated with the SAP conversion at the time when that decision was made. We took a one-time charge on some of those. Again, it was split up for the most part between, again, the one-time write-off which was quite a bit higher than the accelerated...", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "...depreciation, and then again, a couple other severance-related costs that are part of a certain item.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. So the project costs didn't go through accelerated depreciation just the one quarter of that, that's it?", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's right. Then something you'll see in the third quarter, not part of the accelerated depreciation, that was a one-time write-off of project costs that were again associated with the SAP.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. Because if you \u2013 yeah, so we should take about $15 million or so off of the D&A just to get to sort of a normalized D&A for the quarter? That's what I'm really trying to get to.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's probably a reasonable ballpark, Andy.", "Andrew Paul Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is now open.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "So really looking at the change in the org structure, the eight to six markets, what changes does that necessitate for the levels below them right down into really out to the op companies? What are they going to have to do differently? Where do you think you pick up execution benefits? And do you think this is kind of the structure we're going to have going forward? Or do you think you'll play around with it a little bit more and look for some more efficiency?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think, John \u2013 good morning. It's, again, the structure hasn't changed, all we've done really is consolidate it from eight to six. When we went to the structure, the structure's really evolved over the last few years. But when we went to the functional structure a couple years ago, we felt eight was important. There's a lot of ramp-up work and change management work to do when you put this type of structure in place and you've never had it before.", "We just feel today that in conjunction with everything else that it's a good metaphor, if you will, for \u2013 I talk about in the expenses where we can spread our top people a little bit further. We're further along in a lot of our transformative work. And we just felt that we can run the business very well with six. And it impacts not just the market presence, but all the functional leads as well in the four areas. But it really doesn't change that much at all, if anything, at the operating company level.", "Tom, do you want to -?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "The only thing that it adds is a little more geography for each of the markets, which means a couple more operating companies that report into that market level. As Bill said, the reason we're confident now is we've had enough time with this structure and the functional leadership that we feel like we're driving out consistency across the business and a few more operating companies for each market is not going be a challenge for them.", "I think that's the only other thing I'd add is this we're very focused on a consistent design. And what I mean by that is both at the market, but also at the operating company and trying to drive a little more consistency which we believe will improve execution and we've seen that so far and we also believe that we'll create a better customer experience because it will be more consistent market-to-market and operating company to operating company.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Look, John, I think we'll continue to tweak things to Tom's point. But this structure we really believe is vital and I think it's been a key part of the beginning of the momentum that you're seeing here over the last several quarters. So I wouldn't expect this structure to change. These are $5 billion and $6 billion markets. So when you think about that, it requires a fair amount of focus between the corporate center and that opco, and so we think we've got it about right here at six.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And then maybe for Tom, where are we now with the revenue management organization? How much of the benefit are we now starting to see flow through? And where do you think the biggest opportunity is if you think about the next 12 months to 18 months? And I guess both margin and case growth do impact either one.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "So great question. So we now, literally last week, had our training for our last dozen operating companies. So basically by the end of the fiscal as we've said, we'll be fully up and running, meaning a revenue manager in every operating company and the market structure that's been in place now for a quarter will be fully operational. So what we continue to believe is that by leveraging that organization and creating a more standardized set of what I'd call routines and they've partnered nicely with our business technology team in creating some tools for these folks to really focus on ensuring that the product costs in a market is competitive and consistent. And we believe that by leveraging those routines and some of those tools out there that we're going continue to see some benefit on the margin side. It's really there as a support or enabler for cases, it's not a driver of case growth per se, other than ensuring that we've got the right market pricing in place.", "So we feel good about where we're at. I'm not in a point where I'm looking to peg a number for you, but I think we feel good about the work that's been done and we're continuing to scale it across the organization.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the lean of Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, great, thanks very much for taking my question. Good morning, guys. So I just wanted to ask also for an update on the ERP rollout? I know a couple months back you folks had mentioned a bit of a different approach to that, just wondering if you can give us all an update there?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Vinnie. There's not a lot to report there. It's just been a couple months as you point out. So we're putting together plans, there's 12 opcos that we're going to bring back to this enhanced SaaS platform and we're going to start with one company here in the next couple months. But we're on target from a planning standpoint. We've put the teams in place and got great coordination between the operating side of the business and the BT side as well as shared services. So early days, but still very committed and on track.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then, just as a follow-up, maybe just going back to your private brand sales that had a nice increase this quarter. I know you mentioned obviously about the independent customer growth volumes coming through. But just in terms of categories that you are seeing, kind of where do you think maybe some of the most opportunity is there? Any expansion plans from the private brands in general? Maybe kind of where you see the bigger changes by our product standpoint?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "This is Tom. I'm not sure there's necessarily any big changes by product category. It's a fairly developed side of our business. And so what I think it allows us to do is, as we introduce new products through the innovation pipeline, most of those are Sysco brand. So that is maybe one new focus area. And I wouldn't say that's necessarily in any specific category. I think the only other thing I'd say is that a lot of what we do in the produce space, and you've heard me talk about the produce growth and this focus on fresh, is in Sysco brand as well. And that, certainly, that continued focus there, that growth that we're seeing in some of those areas are also driving some of the Sysco brand momentum.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much, Tom.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just the first on the trajectory of margins, you had the single best EBIT growth I think in over about a decade. As we think about deflation moderating and inflation potentially coming back next year, how should we be thinking about the recent level of top line flow-through, particularly if you see case growth come back on the whole?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Stephen. First of all, I wish I could tell you when we were going to cross over between deflation and inflation as we were pretty cautious in our comments. So I think we said that we expect it to last at least another quarter, it could be longer than that based on what we're seeing. And so I'm not really sure when to make that call.", "As far as your question goes, it's one of those great questions that's hard to answer, even whether I'm looking back or looking forward. But I think if you go back and look at some of the things that we've said over the last several months and putting the three-year plan together, our hope here would be, when we can return to a more moderate inflation environment, that we would grow the cases and at least hold margin flat, maybe grow it a little bit. And that's the plan and that's going to take a lot of cohesive execution which we're quite confident in right now between cap man Tom spoken to rev man here a little bit ago, and continue to grow those local cases.", "So the key is the local cases and the mix, we need to grow both our local and corporate managed cases, so kind of have that in the right ratio. That will help us on the brand penetration. And if we do that, I think we'll be able to manage our margins well.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great, thanks. And then as a quick follow-up for Joel, when you say that you're going to be lapping this tougher fourth quarter, I guess, is that primarily focused on just the margin? Is there something else that we should be aware of as it relates to top line comparisons? Thanks.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, I think you've hit it. And then, again, we had a pretty decent operating income quarter as well in Q4 of last year. So I think we're just calling out that the comparison for this quarter in particular is a bit tougher than we've had over the last three.", "Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got you. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Question for you just from a top line perspective, obviously, a lot of good strong momentum here in broadline's case growth. Can you maybe just talk about sort of like where you are within sort of like the runway here, whether it's penetration with existing customers, private brand in general and even new channels? There hasn't been that much talk about areas like retail, for instance, which I know is something that's newer for you and maybe the opportunity that you see there. So I'm just trying to figure out sort of like the sustainability of the momentum that you're seeing today.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me start. I think, again, on the momentum part of it, it was a really, really nice quarter and we did a lot of good things and benefited from that. I think from an external standpoint, there were some tailwinds that I don't think you can plan on every quarter in terms of some of the favorable weather comparisons and that kind of thing. And we may be seeing a little bit of a softening out there right now in terms of what we're seeing in our business and the industry. So I think there's the external aspect of that. We can't do much to manage that. But I think, obviously, we're managing within that environment very well right now and we expect to continue to do that.", "I'll get to your question here in a second. The key, I really think is what Tom spoke to earlier in the earlier question, in terms of sustainability, it has to come from the book of business that we have today in terms of our ability to do that. So certainly our ability to continue to fill a pipeline with quality new account business and that may come from different segments to your point. We are doing some things on the retail side. We have talked a fair amount about some good work we've done over the last couple years on the ethnic side and particularly Hispanic. We have some more opportunity there beyond Hispanic and within Hispanic. The whole area of fresh and organic is an area that provides a lot of opportunities. So whether it's customer segments, product segments, trends in the industry, those are all opportunities for us that we are exploring and beginning to get some traction.", "With that said, for us to sustain what we've put up here over the last several quarters and, in particular this quarter, we need to continue to penetrate with our existing accounts that's the most profitable business for us, bring in some new accounts from that quality pipeline and do a little bit better and, we're starting to, in terms of our customer retention. So we need to do all of those things and the good news is we are doing those things right now. So I wouldn't overreact to one quarter or another, but when you look at the year-to-date numbers, those are well within the range of what we've targeted for the three years and we remained quite confident that we can deliver that.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Just one follow-up for you on something that's quietly becoming a bigger part of your story I guess. So if you look at your free cash flow year to date, just reported-wise to something like 50%, I think based upon what Joel was talking about it, maybe it's up more. But you've obviously had good EBITDA growth, CapEx now trending below your forecast. Can you maybe just talk about where the free cash flow and the CapEx sits within what you're focusing on in terms of improvement within that three-year forecast and what we should be expecting going forward?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's great trepidation. Let me start and Joel will give you his color on it. One of the things we're very careful about and meticulous about in terms of the three-year plan was to lock in two or three key objectives that we have financially that we thought would resonate with our investors and potential investors based upon feedback that we've gotten. So we locked in operating income growth, and we also acknowledged that we would expect to grow our EPS somewhat faster over that three-year period than the operating income growth. And we locked in our return on invested capital, and we set a goal out there for 15%.", "Now obviously, that was before the Brakes deal. But we're on track today within the business as it sits today, Ed, to hit or slightly surpass the 15%. Once we close on the Brakes deal, we'll be able to bring that in and give you some color on the impact of that. But we are very, very focused on the return on invested capital. And, obviously, they come together, to your point, in terms of free cash flow and EBITDA growth.", "So we don't have a particular delta target, if you will, for EBITDA growth or free cash flow right now, but it's been strong here for some time and I would expect it to continue to be strong. And in terms of how we're going invest it, I think you'll continue to see us invested in the business.", "You're right, we're a little under where we thought we would be our CapEx this year. I think Joel commented that we expect to be around $500 million for the year, which is about 1%. In any given year, that could go up or down a little bit based on timing. But I think that 1%, maybe slightly more every now and then, is what you should expect there. And we're going to continue to \u2013 obviously, we're going to be very focused on assimilating Brakes in the right way and even more focused on continuing to run the business here as we've laid out.", "So bottom line is I think you'll continue to see us invest in the business, about 1% CapEx, increase the dividend modestly, probably not quite as fast as the earnings go up, continue to look for good acquisitions, and opportunistically look at buying back shares. Joel, do you want to...", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys. You called out some of the fresh categories in your prepared remarks as specifically produce and proteins. It seems these categories tend to have more specialty competition, particularly for local customers. First of all, would you agree that fresh is an area that you're taking share? And I'm curious how you think about this as a longer-term opportunity, just given your scale versus the specialty mom-and-pops.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Why don't I jump in? First of all, it's hard to tell whether we're taking share, but we're certainly seeing good growth in these areas. So as you I think know, we have our own specialty companies in these areas, FreshPoint on the produce side, and also a variety of specialty meat companies across the enterprise. But we're very focused on these categories, and I don't think it's necessarily a new thing for Sysco.", "But what we know is if we can perform well for our customers in these maybe more challenging categories at times of delivering fresh meat and produce, then that allows us to do the other things also and also do them well. And so we've had a focus on quality and making sure that we've always got the right products out there. We've got a great program in place through our Sysco brand around traceability, which is also very important. So we definitely believe that even as large as we are, we're able to compete in this space. And we're continuing to focus on how we can be better every day for our customers. And so I think we feel good about our performance to date and feel like we can continue to grow in this area, but it's an ongoing day-to-day management of that business to be successful.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got you. And just with the volatile inflationary environment right now, can you talk a little bit about pricing guard rails for your MAs? How much autonomy do they have on pricing? And can you talk a little bit about just your approach, to the extent you can, to ensure that you aren't leaving money on the table, yet still being competitive on price?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "What I'd say is that we still believe in pricing is local in this business for local customers. And so while they have some autonomy through our revenue management work, we're continuing to do a much better job of giving them tools and process to ensure that we're competitive locally but that we're also managing the business. So I would say we continue to believe it's important for them to have that flexibility for our customers. We want to make sure we're competitive on the street each and every day. And we're trying to create the environment where we're doing that together, meaning the salesperson and the company with both customers and our objectives in mind.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it, thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research. Your line is now open.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Hi, thanks for the question. I mainly wanted to get some clarification on your outlook for the operating expenses in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2017. So is $70 million still the right number based on your guidance for this year for total charges? And if that is the right number, am I right in assuming that you're looking at $10 million or $11 million in fourth quarter charges? And then the same question for fiscal 2017, are you still looking at, I think it was $130 million in charges for next year?", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "This is Joel. We've talked about when we talked about the couple recent announcements that we've had that we anticipated around $70 million for this year and around $130 million for next year. Those estimates still hold. So I don't know if that answered your question, but the numbers that we talked about earlier, we still feel good about in terms of as we look forward.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay. And the severance is on top of those numbers. Is that correct?", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There's an element of severance actually built into those numbers, Ajay. So we made some estimates in terms of severance. The $70 million and $130 million basically were comprised of, the way I think about it, really four different things. It was this one-time write-off this year in this quarter, which we talked about in terms of the construction in progress write-off. It's accelerated depreciation, it's severance and what we call conversion costs, things that essentially are due to moving from the SAP system to our enhanced version of SaaS. So I would think about that really as grouped in kind of those four different areas. And so severance again, we have severance estimate that was actually part of that number for those two years.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay, and I had one follow-up question. I think it's follow-up to one of the questions that was asked earlier on the transition from deflation to inflation, so assuming that there is some inflation that reappears next year in fiscal 2017. So I understand the gross margin percentage increases when you have deflation, but would you say there's also some underlying benefit when you're seeing your cost of goods going down as it's been going down over the past two or three quarters, both from fuel and deflation? So would you say it's possible that your input costs are going down at a faster rate than you're passing along to some of your broadline customers? And does any of that benefit start to get offset as you start to deal with inflation again whenever that happens?", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "There's an element of that, Ajay. I mean, there's the math aspect of it and then there's an element of that. Obviously, in our business where you turn your inventory every 20 days, you can't hold the prices for too long given the competitive environment that we're in. So to Tom's earlier point, we're always trying to strike the right balance there with what the customer's needs are. So that's certainly part of it. But I would also say to you that \u2013 I'm not a big fan of deflation, so I think the longer it goes, the more challenging it becomes. People start to expect prices continue to go down. So it's not a good place to be, but it's explainable. I mean, a lot of it \u2013 the way we've kind of got here is the center of the plate, these protein categories are flat to now down, whereas a year, 18 months ago, they were up double-digit, and the rest of the categories are roughly flat, maybe up a little bit or down a little bit.", "So it's primarily being driven in the protein area and that's what \u2013 that's a theory that you will have to watch closely in terms of when we come out of it. But I would just echo what I've said for years and I think what Sysco said for even longer than that, that the best environment for us and for our customers is when you have a moderate level of inflation ideally across multiple categories, 2%, 3%, whatever. And I would say it gets more challenging if you go to where you have 5% or 6% inflation, we've seen that, and it's certainly challenging over the medium term when you have deflation.", "So bottom line, I feel really good about how we're managing it. I think a lot of these commercial initiatives I spoke to earlier and as Tom has spoken to have come at just the right time in terms of managing through this process. And, yes, there's some short-term benefits with deflation to your point, but medium to long-term, not where we want to be.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And I would just add one thing if I could, it's Joel. Just as a reminder, the way it impacts our financials, yes, there is some margin benefit to that. However, ultimately the dollars on the gross profit side we roll through are less when we have deflation typically. So that certainly is the headwind for us, just as a reminder of that.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay. And one final question if I could. Since you called out the Easter calendar shift in your prepared remarks, can you quantify that at all because of the sales impact?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, I don't think the Easter thing \u2013 we called it out just because it was real. But Easter, from my experience, is not quite as big a deal as it used to be years ago. It certainly not as big a factor as Mother's Day, but it was a factor. I think the weather was a bigger factor, Ajay. I think you have to \u2013 when you look at the delta and the case growth, it'd be great to think it was all us, but I think part of it, I think, was driven by just a pretty mild winter in most of the markets that we serve. So to me that was a bigger deal than the holiday.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Great, thanks.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, good morning. I wanted to get a gauge for how big the pressure was from those oil-related states? How big is that for your overall mix of sales? And when do you think you'll start lapping out of that?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I have no idea when we're going to lap out of it. Just like I probably can't predict when we're going to move from deflation to inflation. Matt, we haven't talked about that publicly. I think, again, we're making an effort here to give you our perspective of what's going on as it impacts \u2013 as fuel impacts us. So I think on the good news on the tailwind side of it, there's some flow-thorough we believe with the consumer level. It's hard to quantify that from what we see, but it certainly is enhancing discretionary income. Prices started to pick up here a little bit of late. It has certainly helped us on our cost structure, although we've managed costs extremely well outside of that impact. And we're just pointing out that the downside of it is in a good portion of the Southwest as well as you get up into Montana, North Dakota, and into Alberta, Canada, it goes the other way. So it's meaningful in those markets. And I think if it persists and becomes a more meaningful number, we probably will give you some color on that, but right now we haven't.", "Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. So what do you think the primary factors are to kind of give you your better performance on a local case volume trends versus these disappointing results we're seeing out of KNAPP-TRACK and some of the other casual dining metrics?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Oh my, that's a hard question for me to answer. I can speak to our performance and I think our performance comes from continuing to differentiate ourselves relative to our competition and it remains a very competitive marketplace. And so Tom spoke to the penetration and that's big as well as improved retention. Obviously, as I've said now two or three times and as we've said really since there's been a Sysco, that local case growth, that street case growth is a key focus for us, whereas some of the data that you're citing there is more chain-driven. So I think there's a little bit of a customer mix reconciliation there as well.", "Mark Gregory Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, great. Thank you. Firstly, could we talk about digital as a percentage of sales either in broadline or local case volume, just kind of where that is? And if you've \u2013 and I don't remember, I'm sorry if you have, if you've publicly stated where you think that can go, let's say, by 2018 and the implications that it may have for your business?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - President & Chief Operating Officer", "So we haven't talked about where we think it can go. What we have talked about is that our approach here is to provide the options to our customers to order in whatever manner they choose. And so we continue to believe that's the right approach. We feel great about our marketing associates and the work they've been doing. We know that we need a good viable online system and that's what we've been rolling out through our mobility platform. And, obviously, we still have orders that are placed in other means, called in or faxed in.", "Having said that, we continue to feel good about the work we're doing. The mobility piece, think about mobility as more a handheld or the iPad, iPhone type of \u2013 or Android device. We obviously have desktop. And so our \u2013 as I think we've said before, our online purchases are still relatively small in the street, just slightly under 10%, but growing. And we feel really good about the progress we're making there. But we haven't pegged a number by a certain date because we really believe it's going to find its level place based on what the customers' needs and expectations are.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you. And, secondly, is there any implication at all if the UK leaves the EU in terms of your Brakes acquisition? In other words, Brakes, which has operations in the UK and the EU, are they completely separate and would that have any impact on your business at all?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, hard to assess at this point. And there'll be an impact, John, there's going to be an impact in Europe obviously and the UK in particular. It's hard for me to tell at this point where we are with Brakes to really give you any specific color on that. So we're watching it and we're certainly well aware of when we entered into those discussions. So there's no point in me conjecturing on that. I think we've just got to watch and wait for the vote and see where it goes, but again, just like in this country, people are going to go out to eat and we're very, very fortunate to be getting ready to close the transaction with a very well respected strong company with a great leadership team that's got a lot of good things going on. So we'll deal with whatever comes there, but right now I think we're very excited about the team that we're going to inherit.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. And I would add, just as a reminder, I mean, we're in this thing for the long haul. I mean, we look at that deal as very much a part of our long-term value creation. And so again, as Bill said, we certainly knew that was out there when this was in here, but we're certainly in this for the long term.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Erin Lash from Morningstar. Your line is now open.", "Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on an earlier discussion regarding CapEx. I got the impression that the reduction for this year was related to more timing issues and that would potentially flow into next year. So if you could confirm that? Also then, as it relates to the Brakes deal and I realize that the deal has not closed yet. But the extent to which you can provide some of your initial expectations in terms of whether there's going need to be a step-up in CapEx as you bring that business online, that would be very helpful.", "Joel T. Grade - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, this is Joel. I'll take that. The CapEx commentary, I mean, there's some element of timing in that, but I wouldn't say a lot. So I mean, wouldn't think about this, that there's going be some big spike next year as a result. It is \u2013 Bill talked about, we specially see this area around 1% of sales, from CapEx being a very normal and reasonable number for us. Again, we've got a very disciplined process for the way we manage that based on the needs of our business. And so again, there's some element of timing in that, but, again, I wouldn't expect something significant changing going forward on that.", "And then from a Brakes perspective, the one thing I think we've talked about is that, in general, this company has been well invested in and so certainly as part of the modeling we did for the deal, we factored in some level of CapEx as you'd expect. But, again, I think the level they're anticipating and the level we are, are relatively in line. So I would certainly, again, anticipate \u2013 again, we'll give some more clear guidance on that once the deal's done, but just at a high level, I think you're getting in there in a pretty well invested place and look at CapEx in a relatively similar way than we do.", "Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Thank you, that's very helpful. And then just following up, at the CAGNY conference earlier this year, you discussed the fact that the challenges facing the oil industry were actually benefiting you in terms of your facing some of the truck driver shortage issues that had added to your costs over the last few years. And I wondered if you could discuss that, whether you're still seeing a benefit in terms of an enhanced pool from which to attract truck drivers or whether maybe some of that benefit has been moderating?", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Erin, I think we are. I mean I think the markets that we struggled in a year ago, 18 months ago, we certainly have closed the gap there. Now, some of those challenges were self-inflicted and we've gotten better on the talent acquisition side as well over that period of time. So if we were in the business of hiring truck drivers, we'd be in a better place right now. I would have the tradeoff though. I'll take the business and struggle with hiring truck drivers, but to your specific question, that certainly has mitigated or muted over the last several months and it's not a big issue for us right now.", "Erin Lash - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Thank you very much. I appreciate it.", "William J. DeLaney - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Neil A. Russell - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you very much, everyone.

This morning Sysco reported strong fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results. Our performance reflects both the soundness of our strategy, the commitment of our associates to supporting the success of our customers and the consistently improving execution of our three-year plan.", "For the quarter, on a comparable 13-week basis, Sysco delivered sales growth of 2% and gross profit dollar growth of 5% while limiting adjusted operating expense growth to less than 2% which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of approximately 15% compared to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share grew approximately 15% as well. These results were achieved in a market environment that is experiencing uneven trends and appears to have softened somewhere off-late, while consumer confidence in unemployment data points remain relatively favorable compared to a few years ago. The current sentiment for customer spending and meals away from home seems to be trending slightly downward.", "Turning to specific restaurant industry data, overall sales trends weakened as reflected in current NPD and KNAPP-TRACK Traffic and spend data. That said, according to National Restaurant Association, restaurant operator expectations remain somewhat favorable.", "Moving to our results for fiscal 2016, I'm very pleased with our performance during the year. The improving momentum in our business is a result of strong local case growth, gross profit growth, with gross margin expansion and solid expense management. Specifically, for fiscal 2016, on an adjusted 52-week basis, we delivered the following results.", "Total broad line cases grew 3% and local cases grew 2.7%. Sales grew 1.5% to $50 billion, even with the unfavorable impact of deflation and foreign exchange headwinds. Gross profit grew 3.6% to $9 billion and gross margin increased 38 basis points. Adjusted operating income increased 10% over the prior year to $2 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 12 %. In addition free cash flow approximated $1.4 billion. And adjusted return on invested capital was 14% for the year. I particularly encourage our progress today toward the achievement of our three year plan financial objectives, especially our goal-to-grow adjusted operating income by at least $500 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2018. ", "Our strong progress towards the achievement these financial objectives is supported by a foundation that was built over the past several years through a series of commercial, supply chain and administrative initiatives. We continue to build on that foundation throughout fiscal 2016 by accomplishing several key objectives, including, Leveraging customer insights to create new and enhanced sales marketing programs, advancing our progress in several key commercial areas; including category and revenue management. Shifting our technology strategy and related spend to a more customer centric focus, And restructuring our business to drive greater efficiency including; Streamlining our market structure, introducing a standard field organization model, and further developing a functional structure in key support areas such as merchandising, supply chain and human resources.", "All of this is been accomplished by consistently improving the execution of our strategy, that was centered on five fundamental points. Partnership, too profoundly and receive experience of doing business with Sysco. Productivity, to continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business; Products, to enhance our friends through a customer centric innovation program; People, Leveraging talent structure and culture to drive performance and portfolio, continuously assessing new market opportunities and current business performance. ", "Regarding the latter point; we recently close the acquisition of the brakes group a $5 billion European food service distributor, with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. Brakes is a highly regarded company whose management team and strategy are well aligned with the vision we have for Sysco, to be our customers most valued and trusted business partner. This acquisition will serve as a platform for future expansion in Europe. We're looking forward to working together with the entire Brakes team to execute their business strategy and we feel fortunate to welcome them into the Sysco family. ", "Joe will discuss with you in a few minutes anticipated contribution of Brakes to Sysco financial results. As we enter the new fiscal year, we are executing our strategy at a high level working effectively together as one Sysco and we remain committed to the success of our customers. We have even bigger goals for fiscal 2017. And I'm confident our ability to achieve our financial and business objectives in the year ahead and throughout the three year plan. ", "The new fiscal year brings expanded global presence, enhanced technology and continued focus on our customers. Specifically we intend to deliver solid local case growth, increase our gross profit, reduce costs in the right way and put crosses in tools in place that will further enable our associates to provide our customers with industry leading service and support. Our past and future success is driven by the ongoing dedication and commitment of all of our associates. And I think each of them for their effort to deliver a very successful year in fiscal 2016. ", "And now turn the call over to Tom. ", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2016 was a great year for Sysco and I'm proud of the contributions made by all of our associates throughout the year. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect a year of solid operating performance and excellent progress on several key multi-year initiatives that begun to provide a strong foundation for success. Our payroll operating performance was driven by our ongoing focus on the key drivers of our three year plan, including accelerating our sales with local customers by providing them with exceptional service, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses. ", "This morning I provide an update on some of the initiatives related to our three year plan and how they have continued to positively impact our business results. The first of which is our focus on accelerating local case grow. During the year we grew U.S. broadline local cases 2.6 % unadjusted 52 week basis. Strongest performance we've had several years, also an adjusted 52 week basis gross profit in U.S. broadline group 4.7 % for the fiscal year in gross margin increased 47 basis points driven by our focus on profitable case grow, revenue management activities and improve Sysco brand penetration. ", "The focus our sales teams had on helping our customers succeed and grow has been further enhanced throughout the school year 2016. During the year we remain focused on improving our industry leading category management practices, only deploying revenue management in the field and enhancing our sales training and support tools to continue to free up our marketing associates time to better support our customers with business building solutions. We also rolled out various promotional programs in key initiatives throughout the year, including those that highlight product innovation and reinforce the Sysco brand which delivers tremendous value to our customers that values delivered through an unrelenting focus on the highest quality products, investing class traceability from a food safety perspective. ", "Finally, we continue to focus on delivering new and improved customer facing technology solutions, that value to their business and all our associates to be more efficient. On the cost side, the expense management throughout the year was also solid remains a key area of focus moving forward. For U.S. broadline during fiscal year 2016 we limited total adjust expense growth to only 2.2 % on a compatible 52 week basis compared to gross profit growth of 4.7 %. We also reduced our overall cost per case U.S. broadline by $0.04 during the year. I just think of the impact of fuel prices are just a cost per case in U. S. front line was flat. ", "As we discussed, we've been very focused on reducing costs and improving productivity while continuing to deliver improved service levels to our customers. In fiscal 2016 we reduced expenses and a number of key areas. The supply chain area, we have reduced indirect span will continue to focus on maximizing transportation and warehouse sufficiency. We've also standardized organizational design and reduce the number of our markets in the U.S. from 8 to 6. And throughout the organization we have reduced overall SG&A cost.", "In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly reclined around improving our customers experience, engaging our associates of the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our three year plan. In fiscal year 2016 we made significant progress in all areas, now remain extremely optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Joel Grade", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results of the fourth quarter and the full year. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case grow, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management.", "I begin my remarks by speaking to our fourth quarter. For the purposes of matching your models our fourth quarter results reflecting next week include; Sales growth of 10.0 %, gross profit growth of 12.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 9.6%, adjusted operating income growth of 23.4% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 23.1%. Excluding the extra weeks on a comparable basis, the fourth quarter results include; sales growth of 2.2%, sales profit growth of 4.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 1.7%, adjusted operating income growth of 14.6% and adjusted earnings per share growth a 15.4%. ", "Sales during the quarter negatively impacted by both deflation of 1.2% and foreign exchange of 0.5%, partially offset by an increase in sales from acquisitions of 1.2%. Our comparable 13 week basis total broadline case go through the fourth quarter was 2.2%, Local is 2.4%. And corporate manage growth was 2.0%.", "During the fourth quarter we had some certain items that impacted our results. In the prior year we've acquisition costs $390 million, in the current year. We have re measurement of foreign denominated cash due to lower exchange rates a quarter as well as the premium foreign currency option contracts for the Brakes acquisition. As results other expenses net for the quarter was approximately $141 million primarily driven by certain items from fiscal 2016. ", "As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35% compared to negative 6% in the prior year. Both quarter tax rates reduce primarily from the impact of certain items, which lord of net income and resulted in lower tax rates. A similar event occurred last year related to the U.S. suits termination costs which drove an unusual gap tax rate. On an adjusted for certain items basis our tax it would have been approximately 36.8% in both years. ", "Now turning to our results for the year; our fiscal 2016 including the extra week included sales growth of 3.5%, gross profit growth of 5.7%, adjusted operating expense growth of 4%, adjusted operating income growth 12.1%, and adjusted EPS growth of 14.1%. To provide a relevant comparison the prior year all income statement measures I discuss from this point forward, will be adjusted for certain items and presented on a 52 week comparable bases. ", "Looking at our full year results; we grew sales by 1.5 % year-over-year despite deflation of 0.7%. We saw continued deflation and sat in center of the plate protein categories, such as meat and seafood along with deflation in diary. Sales from acquisition increase sales by 0.7%. During the year we closed five acquisitions including Gilchrist & Soames, and North Star Seafood.", "Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.3% largely driven by the US dollar's strength against the Canadian dollar. The negative impact we have been experiencing on a comparative basis is lessening, as we begin to wrap initial decline in relative value to Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis; sales would have been up 2.7%. ", "Turning to case growth; consistent with our three year plan to achieve discipline case growth, we had strong performance for the year. On a comparable 52 week basis, Total broadline case growth through the year was 3%, Local was 2.7%, and corporate managed was 3.3%. ", "Looking at gross profit and gross margins for the year we grew our gross profit on a solid 3.6% we'll also continuing to see expansion in gross margins, which grew by 38 basis points. The key drivers of gross margin improvements include a category management, more beneficial mix of local business, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business and deflation. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit growth is 4.8%; adjusted operating expense on a comparable 52-week basis is 2% for the year and by 3.3% on a constant currency basis. This increase is mainly driven by the previously mentioned higher case volumes and incentive accruals; and is partially offset by various decreases, including reducing indirect spending; it is still cost and foreign exchange translation. This progress is reflected in a reduced cost per case as Tom mentioned which is flat, excluding fuel price changes.", "As a result adjusted operating income for the year was $1.96 dollars, up 9.6% compared the prior year, and up 10.6% on a constant currency basis. Compared to the prior year on 52-week basis, adjusted net earnings grew 8% and adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. For the full year, cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion off approximately 24% from last year. It is important to note that a timing difference in tax payments impacts our cash flow during fiscal 2016.", "Net working capital improvement by six times a day for the full year compared to last year. This was largely driven by improvements in inventory. Net CapEx for the full year was $504 million and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow include the cash impact of certain items of $280 million in fiscal 2016. As a reminder, the certain items for 2016 are mostly related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods.", "Lastly, we improved our adjusted return on invested capital to approximately 14% during the fiscal year, up from approximately 13% in the prior year.", "Now I'd like to close with some commentary on the outlook for fiscal 2017. The deflationary trend has been persistent over the last four quarters and will likely continue through the remainder of the calendar year, creating modest sales and gross profit headwind for the first half year. The restaurant environment appears to be softening and as a result, we anticipate modest case volume growth for the next quarter or two. Capital expenditures during 2017 are expected to be approximately 1% of sales, including Brakes.", "We intend to continue to improve working capital days to achieve our three-year-plan goal of four days' improvement when comparing fiscal year 2018 to fiscal 2015. And we expect to complete our $3 billion, two-year share repurchase program during fiscal 2017. We anticipate a benefit of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted EPS in fiscal 2017, driven by a reduction in average shares outstanding. Regarding the addition of Brakes to Sysco's financial results, we expect the combined company will have roughly $55 billion in annualized revenue on a pro forma basis. ", "In our most recent fiscal year, ending December 2015, Brakes reported nearly $5 million in revenue, up roughly approximately 6.5% from 2014. They also reported an approximate 5% adjusted EBITDA margin with a double-digit growth rate. Roughly two-thirds of their revenue comes from the United Kingdom, where they have a leading share. We continue to believe this acquisition will be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share by lower- to mid-single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in fiscal 2018 and beyond. This acquisition is also expected to reduce our normalized effective tax rate to about 35% to 36%. ", "In summary, we had a strong quarter and year, reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives in our two-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I feel confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.", "Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Merissa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Merissa Sullivan", "Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about gross margins and see how much [Technical Difficulty].", "William DeLaney", "It's challenging when to answer that specifically. I think you will see some correlation over the last four or five quarters, where as we see some deflation, the more margins moved up. We're making good progress on relative margin trends before that, but I would tell you that we believe a significant amount of the improvement is coming from a lot of these initiatives I referred and that Tom spoke to in more detail along the lines of category management, revenue management, the work we're doing in segmentation, tools we're providing our sales force, so I can't quantify exactly but I think it's coming from multiple sources.", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Yes, I think the only thing I would add is you heard me talk about fully deploying revenue management. We're now at a place where we've got it within our entire organization. And so I think we continue to believe that, as Bill said, a combination of all those things are allowing us to manage the difficult deflationary environment that we've been in.", "Merissa Sullivan", "All right, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. You mentioned the uneven environment. I just want to see if you can comment further on the restaurant industry trends and specifically what you're seeing from both your independent customers and your chain customers. Thank you.", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Well, it's not just what we're seeing -- I think it's what we're hearing from other folks that are speaking to their results, both in the operator side and some of our peers in the industry. So I think it's just a little bit softer. I think the good news here: People are still relatively optimistic, both the consumer confidence in general and the restaurant operators. When you look at those indices and compare them over the last couple of years, generally, the outlook is favorable, but we're just seeing some softening in terms of the slope of the growth, and specifically, we're seeing it in traffic continuing to be flat, and check size up in some segments, flat in other segments. So it's no one place, it's a relative comment. We're still seeing growth but it's just not the same trajectory that we saw a couple quarters ago.", "Merissa Sullivan", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is open.", "John Heinbockel", "So let me start, either for Bill or Tom, I guess a lot of your end customers are struggling a little bit with the value of creation relative to eating at home, and if you think about the next several years with wage inflation likely to increase in the restaurant space, what do you do today or, more importantly, if you look out over the next two or three years, to help them deal with that? So what are the opportunities as it relates to more Sysco brand, selective price investments. How do you think about helping them compete and maybe drive some market share for yourself?", "William DeLaney", "Good morning, John. I'll start but I'll let Tom kind of get into the meat of that a little bit more. I think just from my perspective, this market place has been extremely competitive for most of my career and even more so since 2009, and we continue to see that. I think some operators are doing fine. And the best operators are going to do well and the best distributors are going to do well, and I think that will continue to play out. So I think it's -- everyone has their own unique challenges, but if you're investing in your business, if you're listening to your customer base, and if you can scale what you're good at, I think you're going to continue to have good success here. So you hit on a couple things that we're doing, but I'll let Tom take you through and remind the group here all the different things that we're doing to differentiate ourselves to our customers.", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "John, maybe just to build on a couple things; while you're right, there are some reports out there, some traffic headwinds for some of these folks. The good news for them obviously is that in a deflationary environment, is their cost of products in general are not necessarily going up. So that's been a good thing for those restaurant operators. But from our perspective, we spend a lot of our time trying to think about what are those areas where we can help them be more successful. You mentioned labor rates potentially going up; that's obviously a key concern of many of these operators today.", "And so whether its Sysco brand, where we bring not only value but also things I talked about which is great reliability and traceability and high-quality products. That's a big area of focus for us. The tools, think about some of the innovative products we're bringing. We're focused on how do we reduce the labor costs for these operators. So if there are products that are labor-saving type of products in the preparation, that allows them to leverage some of those things that offset -- maybe some potential labor increases they're seeing.", "And as Bill said, I think technology and tools in general that allow them to manage their business more efficiently are also things we're focused on. So it's really a combination of things but it's -- you're right, there's a lot of things that they're dealing with and I think the more we can focus on helping them be successful, that's a good place for us to be.", "John Heinbockel", "All right. And then secondly, I know it's early, but have you seen any reaction or change in Brakes' performance or their end demand post Brexit? Or that ends up being kind of an overblown issue?", "William DeLaney", "I don't think it's overblown, John, I think it's just too early to tell. Heading into Brexit, I would say as we got into March and April, we did see through their eyes or get some feel for it and the data out there, there was some slowing in their business in the UK just in general, and a lot of that was attributed to the uncertainty of Brexit. And I think the implied thought would be that once there was certainty, that things would kind of bounce back a little bit. I think that assumed that the certainty would remain. And obviously the vote went the other way, so now what you've got is continued uncertainty. So I just think it's going to be an extended period of time here. And I think it'll play out politically, it'll play out economically, so it's a little slower in the UK right now. The good news for us is it seems to be -- we seem to be seeing some good things coming out of France and Sweden; I believe that's about a third of their business. ", "So I think as far as Brexit's concerned, I think we're all watching it and to this point, I don't know that I've seen clear analysis in terms of what the specific impact is going to be at a certain point in some. My judgment would say that it's going to play out over the next two or three years; it will become business as usual here over that period of time and it'll be somewhat of a headwind in the context of uncertainty that our people will work through in their market place.", "Joel Grade", "Yes, and I think this one thing I could add -- it's Joel -- I'd just remind you, certainly while there's some short-term instability that this creates, to some extent, we certainly again remain very bullish of this, as a long-term value creator for this company. And a great management team, great platform for future growth, and again, just an overall good long-term view, despite some of those slight -- again, some short-term instability as a result.", "John Heinbockel", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Edward Kelly", "Hi, good morning, guys, and nice quarter. I'd like to start with just the outlook. So you guys took 20% to 30% of the $500 million EBIT target in 2016, I think, which at the high end of that would be $150 million. You just did $173 million, excluding the extra week, $217 million if you include it. I guess the first part of this question: So what drove that upside to how you were initially thinking about things? And then as we think about 2017, you talked about 50% to 60%, which is probably like $300 million at the high end of the range. That does now seem kind of low, so how should we think bout 2017, given that you're ahead of where you thought you'd be at this point? Thank you.", "William DeLaney", "Thank you. I'll start. I'll let Joel get into detail a little bit more. I would say in terms of why our performance for 2016 was better than originally what we projected, I think part of it is just having the time to refine the plan and to go deep on the plan. And our execution was just very good. So if you put all this into some type of context, our merger agreement with US Foods was terminated in late June, we regrouped as a management team very quickly, in July we put together the framework of a three-year plan and shared that with the investor group in September, along the way with our Board.", "And so I wouldn't say we were cautious, but we certainly were thoughtful in terms of what we were leading people to and as we built some momentum, if you'll recall, first quarter, we had a very solid quarter, U.S. broad line, but there's some tailwinds with incentives and it kind of -- or headwinds with incentives and the first quarter was a little flattish and then very strong, second, third, and fourth. So we built momentum as the year went along. To bring it back to numbers, we've been able to manage this deflationary environment very well and create a good spread between our gross profit growth and our expense growth, by managing our expenses very smartly and thoughtfully. ", "So overall, I would just say the execution has been good and -- very good, and as we got deeper into the year we were able to raise our estimate to $500,000. Not quite ready to do that right now, I'd like to get further into this plan; we're a third of the way through it, so I'd like to see another quarter or two and see how we perform, see how the market place performs, and reassess that outlook at that point in time. Joel?", "Joel Grade", "Yes, I think that's really the context that I'd put that into. Is that we're through the first year now of our three-year plan, to the point that you made and Bill certainly reinforced. Good momentum to business, and in the end, a little bit of softness that we're seeing in the industry, but certainly feeling good about where we're at. I think the comment Bill kind of closed with is what I would close with, as well. Is that again, it's still early on, and I'd like to give it a little bit of time under our belt before we take a look at if there's anything else we wanted to do there.", "Edward Kelley", "Okay. And just, I wanted to follow up. One of the, to me, more impressed with sort of under the radar accomplishments for you guys is this dramatic improvement in the free cash flow. Can you talk just a little about what's been driving that and the opportunity that you see left here, no payables, there seems like there's a fairly large opportunity. Just thought on sort of where we can expect that line item to play out over the next couple of years. ", "William DeLaney", "Yes, sure. I think, a couple things on that, and certainly number one, we had strong operating performance. And so that's certainly generated by a good part of the free cash-flow, you talk about the focus we had on working capital. You know we've had some we aggressive goals the start of a three year plan, and I think one of a primary benefits this year was in focus on inventory and we made some good progress in that area. And I think you'll continue to see the opportunity there again both on the table's area as well as inventory and someone they are as well so we got some continued focus on working capital of that I believe we're making good progress on and will continue to drive that. We did some benefit this year of as I mentioned.", "And some timing issues on cash taxes, things that were related to of the timing of payments and ability to accelerate some deductions having so that we are we also did have something in some going the other way in the U.S. foods payments that we made the first quarter of this year. so I would guess what I would say in general as I think the level of free cash-flow you are seeing that we experiences years is a pretty reasonable view of what I believe this business can generate here as we move forward, over the next couple years and so I think I think we're good place we're going to continue driving initiatives that were driving improve that performances as well. ", "Edward Kelley", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Zachary Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Zachary Fadem", "Good morning, it looks like there was a conversion in in total broadline versus the local case growth in the quarter can you talk about the driver's hearing how trends played out just throughout the quarter and you mention already the performance of chains verses independence but what about your institutional customers like the healthcare and WeCare vertical power they trending. ", "William DeLaney", "Zach, would you be more clear what you mean by conversion. ", "Zachary Fadem ", "Well, I mean when you look at the broadline case trend and the local case trend, they both converged at that but you know.", "William DeLaney", "The numbers okay. And. So I would think for times about the segments a little bit. I think it's just what you said. You know we and I would say by this business understands that where we have the opportunity to bring the most value, it isn't that look we managed highly street-oriented customer base and we continue to focus there in a myriad of ways that we spoke to in terms of a commercial initiatives, supply chain, and all that type of thing. And that's continued to pay dividends force or less than two years plus. As we feel good about that we also want to continue to grow the corporate managed business in the right way, and so you are seeing the slope of the growth of the fall of somewhat but it's still positive and there is still very, very important relationships with others with some very large customers, That work for us as well from profitability standpoint. ", "So the balance is always the key here and it's -- this is key if you're running an operating company and its key from a -- from the overall corporate standpoint which as you saw here's quarter with pretty good balance, so in any points time one segment you called that for a moment may be going a little faster than the other and that's okay but generally we're looking to grow both in the right way with good discipline and that we've been making great strides are last a year two. So I'll let Tom speak a little about this segment performance.", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Yes. The only exact I'll add is, around this segment you think you mentioned chains and also healthcare, we continue to feel good about each of the segments in their growth potential for us, honestly healthcare's continued to be growth segment for this industry and I think the chain business while it's going to have it choppiness depending on which customer you're talking about overall that business, I think is going to continue to be solid out there. For us I think it's a really is built on a balance in so looking at different customers in their relative profitability and where we can actually have the most value was where we trying to focus our efforts. And clearly, that's in that local restaurant segment certainly, probably more, so than in the chain restaurants segment. But overall I think we don't see necessarily other than some of the chain number you've seen, from some of those companies we see fairly consistent a performance across these segments. ", "Zachary Fadem", "And then to touch on breaks out quickly can you talk about just margin opportunities there you mentioned it's a 5% adjusted EBITDA margin, but can you talk about some of the facility and productivity efforts there and how do you think about the long term margin opportunity, and how that can play out. ", "Bill DeLaney", "Well Joe said, we made significant investment here for the long term, we certainly expect and will grow their business on the top line, they have very similar approach as we do especially in the UK in terms of a disciplined approach, they are as we've alluded to in the past and going through some significant transformative change of their own, a fair amount which is played out in the supply chain in the United Kingdom, where they're consolidating warehouses into warehouses that look more like ours where you have multiple capacity -- storage capacity all in one building which in and of itself what will create cost savings, improve productivity that kind of thing.", "So certainly, the supply chain in particular and UK is an opportunity for Brakes to expand their margins. But there's other opportunities as well starting with growing with the right customers and making sure that those customers are interfacing with them and ordering product in the way that they want to the chances they prefer. So they've a lot of the same opportunities that we have. ", "Zachary Fadem", "Great, thanks Bill, appreciate the color guys. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Ann Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Kelly Bania ", "Hi, good morning. Wanted to just follow up on the independence, I realize it is moderated slightly but still very solid growth I think if you look over the past several years the lease, so just wondered if you when you analyze that segment what are you seeing there that's really the drivers there that is it still pretty broad based, are there any ethnic categories or regions or when you talk to your customers there is there any difference in take out or dying in trends, just trying to understand what you think the real drivers are for the independent or local case growth. ", "William DeLaney", "Sure, I'll take that. The thing about the independent segment there's been a lot of discussion around whether it's growing or not the growing, I think the way we look at it is we have significant opportunity to grow in that segment and I think if you think about the fact that there are many distributors in the industry, there's opportunities for us is to earn additional share of that business from our customers. So we're very focused on delivering the kind of things that they need which we talk about a lot of those value drivers for our customers and whether things like Sysco brand of some of the tools that were bring them help them manage their business better. In addition you mention some segments you heard us talk about some of the ethnic segments, we obviously there's been a nice tailwind in the Hispanic Latino restaurant segment, it's been a focus area for us and so we continue to look at those types of opportunities where there's nice kind of tail winds that week can provide incremental value to those folks and also grow our business. ", "And I just say that overall that segment feels like they're picking up some share potentially in this away from home and whether it additional opportunities for home deliveries you talk about, we here and we all see some of these trends taking place with some of these folks who are creating that opportunity for those local restaurants, and I think they are back benefiting from some of those technology solutions as well. ", "Kelly Bania ", "Great, that's very helpful. Then in terms of deflation I think you know it was called out as one of the drivers or maybe not drivers' one of the factors that favorably impacted gross margin this year, and I think you called it out of the gross profit headwind for the first half of next year. So just curious is that just because of the sales impact or is there a change in how you expect the deflation to impact your gross margin in the first half of 2017. ", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Hi Kelly, Joel will explain it to you better than I can but it's just the way you think about math. Alright so gross profit is dollars, so when you're selling a case for whatever 0.7% or 1% less than you did same time Lasher you're obviously taking fewer dollars to pay your expenses with that said from on a percentage basis so that they can contribute to an expansion of your margin for saying, I think that's really the main point I mean if you think about portion of our business is being on cost plus. And just in general they were the cost of goods, there is again some margin percentage increase but it is a tip of the headwind on the gross profit dollars themselves of course. Having said that certainly there's great work being done by Tom and his team and our associates actually offset some of that to the extent we can. ", "Joel Grade", "Tom made an interesting point, which I am I think our customers perspective well we're now a fan of deflation and this is -- we're now as we speak in our fifth quarter of that so that's we don't think that's particularly give thanks for our customers or for us certainly over the medium to long term with that said, if it was going to happen try came the right time for customer bases are dealing with some wage inflation as well, so it's probably been good on the customer side we've been able to manage it well, but we would certainly prefer to see no inflation, modest inflation that type of thing in a more steady state environment. ", "Kelly Bania ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research. Your line is open.", "Ajay Jain", "Bill, in you're prepared comments I think you mentioned a slowdown in traffic up from NPD and I think you cited nap crack also and I think last week case growth was also sequentially weaker slightly U.S. foods. so I just wanted to ask apart from the software industry wide trends are there any kind of company specific factors in terms of any slowdown in case growth and has there been any change in the trend line quarter-to-date in terms of traffic in average check, is there any incremental change in the trajectory a quarter-to-date, thanks. ", "William DeLaney", "Well, again we're talking about earnings from the June quarter, but what I'm telling you is we've seen Softening and the customer base, both from the date usage side as well as what we see, so well obviously what we're seeing here is there there's some softening in the business, as I also said we're still seeing growth and I would expect that will continue to see growth, perhaps not the same trajectory but also has a big secular development I think it's just we go through these cycles of time will tell whether so many site we're not, but if you -- if you agree all the data that we also are exposed to what you're seeing in this industry is pretty consistent, when you're seeing in the economy right now that its growth but it's modest, and I think that's where customers are dealing with right now.", "So our focus continues to be you know how do we support our customers to grow their business profitably and do the same for us at the same time and I've never felt better about our ability to do that, we've got a great team here a very solid strategy, we're executing well also you were going to impact and control what we can control and will work through cycles as they come and go.", "Ajay Jain", "Okay, and I just have one follow up question on Brakes, I think you already got several questions on Brexit. Can you specifically talk about the currency impact and just on restaurants spending overall in the UK because I guess the currency impact could be viewed as threefold you've got to direct P&L impact which is fairly you know straightforward but then the currency also impact the purchasing power of the UK consumers and it also affects your purchase price for the acquisition. so I think you're partly hedged on the currency impact, can you just comment on how big of an incremental impact there is from Brexit compared to what you anticipated, when you consummated the other merger and can you also just talk about current case trends that at Brakes, I think you mentioned that they took a little bit of a step backwards. Can you confirm whether they're positive or negative based on year-over-year comparison, thanks? ", "William DeLaney", "There are three questions in there; actually I think what I said about Brakes is the UK market in general. What we've seen it is as if from March and April and I was connected to Brexit the uncertainty of the Brexit vote by and instant the vote you know we see some softening over there in that market and the data in the government it will perform -- support that as well [indiscernible], the position I was to come in their numbers you just a because that -- last month but will talk more about that certainly in November when we release for the first quarter, we feel good about this show so we feel very good about this acquisition, about the leadership investing for the long term, acquisition platform all the things we said on from the beginning, so Brexit I'm going to let Joel take you through the currency issues I think we manage it quite well actually as far as the transaction goes, as you said there's normal translation of earnings and that type of thing. ", "And I wound up in dispute all your points I would just say from my perspective the bigger issue as far as Brexit concern is always is what it comes down to here in our markets as well, is what's the impact on the consumer. I think it's less about foreign exchange at the consumer level. And because of some of the uncertainty we see some softening over there. The weather I mean you hear all the same things whether in London you know in the summertime there kind things, so I think there's going to be some ups and downs will be the better position to talk about in November but overall we're very pleased the acquisition. We have a lot of work to do there and we're very excited about it.", "Joel Grade ", "Yes, I would just add a couple things I mean the translation impacts again certainly will be something will be dealing as we move forward in terms of the prices also as we mention there was actually we had a foreign currency re-measurement that basically resulted from the fact that, at the end of the year, we were holding strong on our balance sheet for the purchase price. Of course, the deal closed right after the year, so we had -- the balance sheet needs to be revalued to the exchange rate that exists at that point in time. Our team did a great job of hedging to protect us on the upside and purchasing currency opportunistically to maximize our ability to minimize that foreign exchange devaluation.", "But we did experience some of that, and some of which was also reflected in the end purchase price. But overall, again, I would just tell you we'll continue to manage through that stuff and, as Bill said, continue to focus on driving -- focus on the customers and the operational performance of that company.", "Ajay Jain", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Karen Short", "Hi, just going back -- sorry to harp on this softness -- recent softness question. I guess if you had to fill -- kind of rank potential causes, I mean, I would think value equation maybe being out of whack is on the list, but maybe recent unrest, terrorism domestically, Olympics, people staying home\u2026any way you can kind of rank any of that?", "William Delaney", "I don't know that I'd rank any of that in my top three, but Karen, I'll share a view[ph part 14 1;29] on some of that. You know, we read a lot and try to learn as much as we can from folks that follow all the components of the industry. I just think it's a little bit of a malaise. I just think it's -- you know, you're going to have these cycles and sub-cycles in any point in time, and some of it, we've been going up against some stronger numbers a year ago, so there's some math in it. But it just feels a little bit softer out there. I think people are being a little more cautious with their spend. Maybe the election, maybe -- I'm not sure. ", "So I guess I wouldn't want to just conjecture here, but I don't think it's the Olympics, I don't think it's any one thing in particular. I just think it's a little softer and it seems to be showing up in multiple places, so I don't think it's a certain type of customer per se or anything like that. I just think it's one of these sub-cycles we're going to go through and time will tell whether it's a three- to six-month deal or longer. But again, from our perspective, we've been managing through some pretty significant headwinds this year, and I couldn't be more pleased with how we've been executing. So, again, we can't totally control the industry top line, but I feel good about what we're doing in our space and how we're driving earnings and at the same time, staying very close to our customers and focusing on what's important to them. So that's the best I can probably give you from our stance.", "Karen Short", "Okay, that's helpful. And then I'm just curious. One of your competitors recently gave some data on percent of sales from independent restaurants coming from an e-commerce platform -- from their e-commerce platform: at a pretty high 50%. I guess I'm just wondering if you can give some color on where you stand on local penetration as a percent of independent sales and just an update on where you're at with that.", "William Delaney", "I'll let Tom speak to that more specifically. I would just remind you that our strategy is really predicated on being the most valued, trusted business partner. So we're not setting goals per se for certain percentage of Sysco brand or certain percentage of orders through mobile or digital. With that said, we certainly understand that we need to make the experience with Sysco as easy as possible and certainly, being able to order online when you want to order, the way you want to order, that those are very important and increasingly important to our customers. So we've got a lot of good work going on with our digital platform to make that experience a more positive one and a productive one for our customers.", "So our numbers are modest but they're beginning to grow but, again, the overall target is here, is to drive the business in the right way, it's not necessarily to hit a particular percentage. Go ahead.", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "So Karen, I'll just build a little bit on that. I think in the past, we've talked about we've been somewhat in this kind of high, single-digit just below 10% through the fourth quarter. Now we're seeing over 10% of our orders for these local customers coming through this mobile or digital platform. So we do see some progression continue to happen, but as Bill said, it's really for us about creating the environment where they can order how they want, when they want, and where they want. And so there were also a few tools we needed to build to be able get in place, to enable them to do that more effectively. And we've got some of those tools now in place, and that we believe we'll continue to see that number grow as more customers have that interest.", "But we also know from a lot of the work we do that our marketing associates are one of the most highest valued resources we have and that we provide our customers. So we're trying to make sure that we balance the how they order with the service and support they need to get day in and day out from our selling resources. So we feel good about the progress but certainly we'll probably see that continue to grow, but we're very focused on the overall customer experience and letting them choose.", "Karen Short", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Hi, thank you. Can you give us a little color on the deflation by category, and are there certain quarters where you're going to start lapping at some of the bigger headwinds?", "William Delaney", "We're lapping them, so it's started. I think generally it's in the meat, seafood, and some dairy. Joel, is that about right?", "Joel Grade", "That's correct.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "So is the deflation cooling for you now or is it still as heavy? I mean, it's a pretty big deflationary number this quarter.", "William Delaney", "Yes, I'd say it's moved around a bit these last three quarters but I'd say relatively steady from where we were half a year ago, six months ago.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Okay. And just to get into the softening of the backdrop a little bit. I wanted to get your thoughts on restaurant store growth out there. Because a lot of the health indicators you're looking at are same-store sales measures, so I'm curious: Do you think there's over-storing going on out there as part of the problem? And what's been your percentage of business from new stores over the last several years?", "William Delaney", "You know, Mark, I think when you go back to 2009, 2010, clearly there was oversupply and overcapacity, and I think there's been a pretty good correction since that time. I believe we've seen some modest reduction in restaurants -- number of restaurants here over the last year or so. But nothing to the degree we saw for or five years ago. There may be a little bit of a modest correction, but I don't think that's an overriding issue, I think it's somewhat self-correcting.", "We don't really track our sales to new stores. The way we track them, Mark, is we track new business for us, which is make an account to an operator that we didn't sell a year ago this time, and we track watch business, which is just the opposite where we had a sale a year ago and we don't have any. And then we track penetration. So the softening, if you will, is probably showing up a little bit more on the case penetration side right now.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Okay. And do you think the strength you've had in local is enough to kind of overpower some of the broader industry softening?", "William Delaney", "I feel very good about our three-year plan and I feel very good about how we're executing the business and if that's your question -- the bottom line is we feel good about the momentum we have, we feel really good about the year we just passed. And, if it is a little softer, we've got good things going out. We're handling expenses very hard right now and we're very committed to the plan.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Stephen Grambling", "Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in, a couple of follow-ups to earlier questions. I guess, first, related to -- I had a question on EBIT growth targets. I think you had previously looked for 55% to 65% of the goal coming from gross profit and the remainder in supply chain and administrative costs. As you think about the better execution driving the upside, where you think that has impacted those buckets most and where is the biggest opportunity going forward?", "William Delaney", "Stephen, I think both those lines are critical lines, but certainly you have to start with gross profit. I mean, we make $9 billion in gross profit. That's more than the sales of many, many of the people we compete with head to head. So that's a huge number that we've been able to grow very nicely on an adjusted basis over the last year to two years. And how do we do that? It comes back to the levers we've talked about. Case growth, with a particular emphasis on local case growth, managing the margins, utilizing a lot of the tools, many of which are technology-based today, and taking a good hard look at where our potential is in terms of territories within each district, within each opco. ", "So assessing the opportunity for growth by territory, by district, by opco; taking advantage of some of the revenue management tools that Tom and his team are -- have put in place over the last year and are just now beginning to mature; continuing to utilize the category management process, both from leveraging our spend but also bringing innovation to that product; staying close to our customers, refining our customer insight where -- to be as current as we possibly can in terms of what the needs of those operators are as they face the challenges, so you have to start with gross profit and the ability to grow those dollars, and we've done a nice job there and I expect us to continue to do well.", "With that said, as I said in terms of the pillars of our strategy, we need to be more productive in everything we do. And we set some goals out there and certainly running the business at a flat cost per case for yet another year here is a very appropriate yet aggressive goal and it's going to be paramount for us to have success this year to do that. So we've got some good momentum there in the supply chain. We're managing our SG&A very well. So I feel very good about our corporate spend as well. ", "We're still spending some money in business technology to kind of create those tools that we've been talking about here in particular on the commercial side. So I think we're spending the money in the right place. Over time, we'll continue to flatten out that corporate spend, try to keep the flat cost per case flat in the field. And that combination of good, solid gross profit growth and well-managed expenses should serve us very well.", "Joel Grade", "I think that one thing I would just add to that even -- if you think about the model and how we looked at that spread between gross profit dollars and operating expense dollars, I think one of the things that we remain focused on is that delta between those two. So even in times when we've had some impact of deflation on the gross profit dollars, again, we've continued to focus on driving the expenses to where we look at that spread. And on a year-to-date basis, we're up a little over 1.5% in terms of that delta between those two. And so the only other thing I may call out is just that to think about -- because that's certainly the way we think about that. And again, whether deflation goes up or down, that relative spread between the two is certainly a key part of our model and something we've done really well on the point Bill has made.", "William Delaney", "Yes, and I think the difference in this conversation we're having today versus three, four, five years ago is what I spoke to in terms of the foundation that we've built with a lot of our transformative work, a lot of the initiatives that we put in place. We have tools today, we have structure, we have the right people to do this. It's not easy, it's still a very competitive environment out there, but we're in much better position today to accomplish these things than we were five years ago.", "Stephen Grambling", "Thanks. And within that, you talked about the good work on the digital platform. Where do you think your systems are relative to peers and does this shift away from SAP changeability to implement some of these tools? Thanks.", "William Delaney", "Well, clearly a big part of our ongoing strategy here was to reallocate what we call our business technology spend more to the customer-facing side of the business. So I think the direction is right, the spend is right, we've making good strides. But we've got some work to do to get the -- not just the digital platform but all the tools we use behind the scenes, both to operate the business and to assess the performance of the business. We still have some good work to do here to improve and that'll be a perpetual opportunity. So good work to do, but I think strategically we're spending the money in the right place and we'll continue to invest appropriately in that part of our business.", "Stephen Grambling", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Vincent Sinisi", "Great, thanks very much. And nice end to the year, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the M&A landscape and in particular, with your more of an entry into the fresh and the ethnic products, Trinity, North Star, to name a couple this year. Just kind of how you feel your traction's going where you are from an assortment standpoint and how that factors into your thoughts as you look at any potential further opportunities going forward.", "William Delaney", "I think over the last several years, we've done a lot with specialty meats, specialty produce, gas supply. In terms of bringing those businesses into our company, they're now what we think of as core. Five or ten years ago, they would have been adjacencies. So certainly we've got the foundation there as well and what you've seen here over the last three to five years is we're integrating it much better. I'll let Tom speak a little more specifically, but there's still opportunity out there, particularly on the geographic side, I think, where we have some holes we'd love to fill in geographically but good momentum with the recent acquisitions.", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "I think I'll just add that as Bill said, we really view those specialty areas now as more than a quarter of our business and I think our ability to round that portfolio businesses out across the U.S., we'll create those opportunities like with North Star in Florida. And so we'll continue to look for those opportunities as they come up, but I believe that's an important part of our growth. This whole fresh, the local, those that you've been hearing about and seeing out there are something that we are very focused on through both our produce and specialty meat and seafood companies.", "Vincent Sinisi", "Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Maybe just a superfast follow-up here. On the ERP, the 12 that are being converted back to the enhanced ERP systems. I think you were at kind of the first, second one a couple months ago. Just a quick update there. Where you are in that process?", "William DeLaney", "Yes, it's a 12-month process and we've done one of them very well and around schedule. So we're in a good place.", "Vincent Sinisi", "All right, great. Thanks, Bill.", "William DeLaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have time for one last question. And our last question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John Ivankoe", "Hi, great, thank you. Obviously you ended the year at a gross margin high for the year and it's actually one of your highest gross margins that you've had in many year. So when we think about fiscal '17, is the right run rate of cost of goods sold or gross margins, is it the fourth quarter or should we still consider that we can -- that year-on-year might play an effect as oppose to taking just that fourth quarter result and running that forward?", "William DeLaney", "I would never take one quarter and extrapolate too much John. I think you look at the year, you look at the trends, you look at the environment that we just described and obviously we have plans to grow the gross profit and manage the expenses very well but I wouldn't try anything off in one quarter, good or bad.", "John Ivankoe", "And are you at the level when you do look at that percent where you're kind of in a competitively good place where it's a good gross margin for you and in terms of the relative value that you're customers are getting and how you're competition is competing against you? In other words, is there any risk like we've seen in previous periods that some of your competition starts to ease their gross margin in an effort to gain traffic share?", "William DeLaney", "I can't speak for that. I mean as I've said, I think for a long, long time; it's a very competitive environment out there. There is a lot of sales people out there in the street and lot of very sophisticated customer, so pricing is always going to be a key part of how customers look at value. I think what you've heard Tom say, as we look at revenue management in which pricing is a component, but nothing more than a component, we're getting better in terms of strategically and tactically facing up with each customer one-on-one and really understanding what is key for them but we have the tools that make sure we're highly competitive in their key items but also where there is opportunities in growth.", "So when you look at our economic model, it's really about having the right price for the right item and the right day for that customer for the street business and remain very competitive with our contract customers. And to do that you need to continue to take cost out and become more efficient. So I wouldn't say that there is anything in particular going on right now that's different than what we've experienced sort of last two or three years. And I wouldn't -- and I also think we still have opportunity to be more consistent in our pricing and that should be a win for our customers and win for us.", "John Ivankoe", "Very helpful, thank you.", "William DeLaney", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

As such, we will reference throughout our presentation today Sysco's financial results both including and excluding this acquisition.", "To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our start in fiscal 2017 and this morning we reported strong first quarter financial results. These results reflect our relentless focus on improving our customers' experience with Sysco that benefits a several key business initiatives that we've implemented over the past few years and the contributions from our new colleagues at Brakes who joined Sysco in early July.", "For the quarter, and excluding the impact of Brakes, sales grew 1%, gross profit grew 5%, while operating expense grew less than 2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 15%. After reflecting the business results of Brakes, adjusted operating income grew 24% to $627 million and adjusted earnings per share grew to $0.67.", "While we benefited from some favorable year-over-year expense comparisons, which Joel will touch on in a few minutes, these results were achieved in an uneven economic environment that is impacting our customers' business. Some metrics reflect positive implications for longer term consumer demand such as steadying unemployment levels, modest GDP growth, increased consumer confidence, and healthy momentum in the housing market.", "However, the restaurant industry, which represents approximately 60% of the foodservice market, is not currently experiencing the level of growth we've seen in recent quarters. Restaurant traffic continues to show year-over-year declines and restaurant spend has decelerated as well.", "More specifically, recent data from both NPD and NavTrak show weakening overall sales trends. That said, we continue to execute our business plan and key initiatives very well. I'm pleased with our progress to date toward the achievement of our three-year financial goals, and I remain confident in our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives over the long-term.", "Our improved and increasingly consistent performance for the past two years is attributed to multi-year foundational work we have carried out in customer insights, category management, revenue management, supply chain efficiencies and administrative expense management. The benefits of these work streams have positioned us to continue to effectively support the needs of our customers and profitably leverage our volume growth.", "Moving forward, we will build on this momentum by maintaining our customer-centric approach while focusing on targeted, disciplined and profitable growth. Both Tom and Joel will provide more detail about the specific initiatives we are currently implementing and their related benefits.", "Turning to the Brakes transaction, we continue to work closely with our experienced and talented leadership team to support their growth, drive out there transformative initiatives and identify additional acquisition opportunities. I'm very excited about the long-term benefits that this business will provide Sysco.", "In summary, we are off to a good start to fiscal 2017, and I am encouraged with the progress we are making as we approach the midpoint of our three-year plan. I'm especially appreciative of the efforts and contributions from all 65,000 of our associates, as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco, to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom Ben\u00e9, Sysco's President and Chief Operating Officer.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflects solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multi-year initiatives. Our favorable operating performance continues to be driven by our ongoing focus on the key levers of our three-year plan, including delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, improving gross margins and managing overall expenses both in our supply chain and administrative functions.", "This morning I'll be providing an update on our business results based on our new segment reporting structure which highlights U.S. Foodservice Operations, International Foodservice Operations, SYGMA and all other.", "During the quarter, U.S. Foodservice Operations, which is primarily comprised of U.S. Broadline, specialty meat, FreshPoint and our European imports business grew sales 0.8% driven by overall case growth in the U.S. Broadline of 1.8% with local cases driving our growth at 1.9%.", "Gross profit in U.S. Foodservice Operations grew 4.3% for the quarter and gross margin increased 68 basis points driven by a combination of factors including our ongoing category management efforts which is how we now go to market with an improved product assortment and centralized approach for majority of our product procurement, which in turn helps us drive out cost for ourselves and our suppliers.", "Second, improved Sysco brand performance with our local customers, the deployment of a suite of revenue management tools and processes that bring more discipline to our sales and merchandising teams, and ultimately more consistent pricing to our customers and the impact of deflation.", "During the quarter, we continue to focus our sales teams on initiatives and activities that will help our customers succeed and grow their business. We have been implementing a variety of sales training and support tools that build overall capability within our selling organization and we have restructured some of the work within that organization to both free up our marketing associates' time and provide access to more targeted resources to better support our customers.", "These efforts in conjunction with ongoing enhancements to our e-commerce tools, which allow our customers to choose how they place the orders with Sysco are enabling us to better leverage our marketing associates to spend more time supporting our customers with unique programs, innovative products and other business building solutions.", "From a cost perspective, our expense management for the quarter was solid and remains a key area of focus for us moving forward. For U.S. Foodservice Operations, during the first quarter, we limited total adjusted operating expense growth to 1.8%. Our supply chain performance is progressing well, and we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and continuing process improvements that are driving efficiencies.", "For U.S. Broadline, cost per case improved by $0.04 for the quarter, and on a fuel price-neutral basis, cost per case was flat. The continuous improvement efforts in our facilities and a continued investment in training for our warehouse associates and drivers has allowed us to build further capability throughout our supply chain.", "One such example is the implementation of a labor forecasting tool that enables us to proactively manage hours at our facilities based on the anticipated workload for each shift. We also remain on track to deliver our previously-communicated administrative cost reductions both in corporate and within the operations.", "Moving to International Foodservice Operations, which is made up of Canada, Europe, Bahamas, International Food Group and our joint ventures in Mexico and Costa Rica, sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased $50 million, both driven by our recent acquisition on the Brakes Group. We appreciate the Brakes Group early performance and continue to look forward to working with the management team on achieving our collective plans in the future.", "During the quarter, Brakes performed reasonably well in the UK amidst the challenging environment, and performance in both France and Sweden was relatively strong. Our business in Canada is off to a good start for the fiscal year as we are effectively managing costs within a deflationary and somewhat soft market environment. And lastly, our joint ventures in both Costa Rica and Mexico had solid performance in the first quarter fiscal year of 2017.", "SYGMA continues to make progress against their key business initiatives and had 4% sales growth for the first quarter. We continue to feel confident in their ability to deliver their full-year growth goals and objectives.", "In summary, our customer and operational strategies are solidly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering our financial objectives as part of our three-year plan. We have continued to make significant progress in all areas for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and I remain optimistic about the programs and processes we are putting in place that will enable our future success.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom have mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Our growth reflects continued momentum from our underlying business including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management, as well as a solid contribution from Brakes. The results that I'll cover for you this morning include Brakes, which significantly impacted our results.", "In summary, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, sales grew 11.2%, gross profit dollars grew 20.3%, operating expense growth was 19.2%, all of which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 23.8% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 28.8%.", "Sales during the quarter were positively impacted by the inclusion of Brakes in our results, though partially offset by deflation of 2.2% in our legacy Sysco business. Continuing with gross profit and gross margins beyond the addition of Brakes, the key drivers of improvement included category management, revenue management, higher Sysco brand penetration in our local business and deflation. Categories impacted most by deflation continue to be the center-of-the-plate protein and dairy. We expect the trend to continue into calendar 2017. That said, we continue to manage this environment effectively as evidenced by our strong gross profit dollar growth.", "The increase in expenses during the quarter beyond the addition of Brakes were mainly driven by the previously-mentioned higher case volumes and a timing shift of expenses related to our option grants from the second quarter into the first and was partially offset by various decreases in indirect spend, fuel costs, favorable comparisons to the prior year, which included planned investments in technology spend related to our three-year plan, and foreign exchange translation.", "As it relates to taxes, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.9% compared to 36.3% in the prior-year period. The decrease in tax rate is driven by tax credits, lower tax rates in the UK due to new tax laws that were recently passed, and the mix of business as we grow in the lower-rate jurisdictions. Compared to the prior year, adjusted net earnings grew 20.7%.", "Cash flow from operations was $249 million, which was $510 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow was $111 million, which was $492 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvements in both are due mainly to improved working capital performance and payments made in the prior year related to the proposed merger with US Foods.", "Net CapEx for the quarter was $138 million. I am pleased with our net working capital performance for the quarter. We had a net two-day improvement versus the prior year and a 2.8-day improvement versus fiscal 2015 and are making good progress towards our three-year goal of a 4-day improvement. These improvements are driven primarily by improvements in all three phases of working capital; payables, receivables, and inventory.", "Our first quarter results included some certain items that were mostly related to the Brakes acquisition including amortization associated with the transaction. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had significant amount of certain items primarily related to the termination of the proposed merger with US Foods.", "Now, I'd like to transition to three business updates. First, regarding Brakes, as a reminder, we initially guided that the acquisition would be modestly accretive to fiscal 2017 earnings per share by low-to-mid single digits. We are now updating that guidance due to finalizing the treatment of amortization as a certain item and believe this acquisition will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share by high-single-digits in fiscal 2017 with acceleration in subsequent years assuming constant currency. For the first quarter, Brakes was approximately $0.04 accretive to our business on an adjusted basis. It is important to note that Brakes business does have some seasonality as the performance is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. Accordingly, we do not expect the same accretion each quarter and, in particular, in quarter number three.", "Second is regarding fuel expense, we expect the favorability we've had over the past two quarters to begin to lap in November. Separately, we are enhancing our fuel strategy. In the past, we used a third-party to forward-buy fixed price contracts approximately 12 months out. Going forward, we are transitioning the management of our fuel expense by using derivatives to hedge our exposure. By separating the management of our fuel purchases from our risk management, we will allow for more effective management of the risk. We'll continue to cover approximately two-thirds of our needs with hedges in place to minimize volatility in price.", "Finally, we are announcing today the upsizing of our credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2 billion and we'll upsize our commercial paper lines accordingly to provide greater liquidity to support our growing business.", "In summary, we had a quality quarter reflecting continued momentum from our underlying business including solid local case growth, strong gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. That said, we have more work to do in order to achieve the full financial objectives of our three-year plan. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution on all areas of our business that improve our financial performance in both the near and long term. I am confident in our ability to continue to execute our plan.", "Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up to allow other participants time for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. It's actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. Thanks for taking the question, and thanks for all the additional disclosure. It's really helpful. I guess first off, can you just give us the bridge in the year-over-year change in gross margins in the International segment? It seems like Brakes is driving a lot of that improvement, and we're just wondering if this is a new level of gross margin that we should expect or if there's any one-time impact from there?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, Ryan. I'm going to start here. I think, look, we have given you a lot of information, and the Q will be issued this week. There will be a little more detail in there, but we're not going to get into bridging individual entities within those segments. But obviously, Brakes did contribute a significant amount. And generally, I would tell you that in Europe, gross margins are higher and expenses are higher.", "Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. And is there an opportunity to lower your expense \u2013 or lower the expense margin to one that's closer to the U.S. over time?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Well, they have a lot of good work going on over there in their own transformation, as we've spoken to a little bit before. So there is opportunity on the supply chain. They're doing some things with their warehouses where they're moving from multiple warehouses to service a market to one, which is more similar to what we see, and there's always opportunities on the administrative side of the business. So I think there will be opportunities. That's a big part of their plan. And I don't know that they'll get to our number necessarily because it is a different market, but there's certainly upside there.", "Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And I guess just last question, can you comment on how cases trended throughout the quarter and the outlook for them going forward, I guess, just given the comparisons start to get tougher the next two quarters?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "So this is Tom. So as I said, the local cases were up 1.9% in U.S. Broadline, and yes, that's been a little bit of a fall off from what we'd experienced in the last couple quarters of fiscal year 2016. I think based on what we're seeing in the restaurant segment, I think we believe it will be continued to be a slight decline from what it's been at the end of last year, but we still feel fairly confident that we'll see continued case growth in the local segment of our business. We're very focused on, as Bill said in his comments, profitable growth, and we want to make sure that we're focused on those right customer segments, but we still believe we can grow our local cases.", "Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Hey Ed.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Can I just start with a follow-up to that last question? Could you just help us understand what you're seeing from an organic case growth standpoint? I don't know how it'd be if you could sort of frame that for us at all relative to the 1.8% and the 1.9%? I'm just curious as to the role that acquisitions are playing into this.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Well, let me start, Ed. I'm going to let Joel and Tom maybe add some color here, but I would say that is largely the organic growth that we're experiencing. What Tom said was if you go back a year, I think we're in the mid-2%s to high-2%s in different quarters, not every quarter was the same.", "So if you go back to my comments, I mean basically we're seeing some slowness out there \u2013 softening, I guess, is a better word \u2013 in terms of overall growth in the restaurant segment, and ours is off a little bit as well. So it just reinforces the importance of solidifying those customer relationships and getting penetration where there is that opportunity where customers are growing as well as continuing to stay really locked in on retaining our customers and identifying new opportunities as we go along, but I mean the 1.8% to 1.9% is largely the organic growth.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And just one second question here that I wanted to ask you about and I kind of asked about it last quarter too, but you maintain your three-year target. Your results so far had been really impressive. I mean this is a great quarter. Can you just talk to us about how you're thinking about that goal at this point, whether you think we'll get an update at some point relatively soon? And as we just sort of sit back and try to consider how things play out from here, Bill, what are the moving parts that we should really be thinking about from here sort of like good or bad going forward?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Well, I think the moving parts, we've touched on here just now. I think we're seeing some softness out there. I think other people are seeing the same thing on a relative basis, and so we're very focused on trying to get our case growth back up over 2%. I think that's very important.", "We're real pleased with how we're managing the margins and still growing the business and taking care of our customers in the right way, and a lot of the steps we took back in the spring to initiate deeper expense reductions are benefiting us right now. So I think the things that we can influence and control we're doing a really good job with. We're probably a little cautious in terms of the overall macro out there for our customers. We still got two points of deflation out there, largely driven by those center-of-the-plate categories, so those will be two areas where we're probably a little bit cautious.", "Obviously, we're in our third year now of earnings growth and I think this is the fourth quarter of double-digit earnings growth on an adjusted basis. So obviously, the bar gets higher and we're ready for that. So we feel very good overall about what we're doing, a little cautious on the environment. I think to your first question, the way I'm looking at that, Ed, is we're one quarter into this year and we're just not quite to the halfway point of the three-year plan. So I want to get a little further into this year and get halfway through the three-year plan, and then I think we'll be able to reassess where we are on the goals.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. So on the M&A impact in the quarter, first of all, was there any M&A impact to U.S. Broadlines beyond Brakes? And then secondly for Brakes, total sales came in a bit higher than I thought. Maybe you could talk about just volume trends there and what the impact of the FX was. And just with the high-single-digit accretion for the year, what are you anticipating for total sales growth for the year for Brakes?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Again, we're not going to get into bridges or trends on individual businesses within segments, but I think as Tom pointed out, I'm going to let Tom speak to this, obviously there're some challenges in the UK right now. We thought the Brakes Group performed well given the environment and very nicely in France and Sweden. I think that's as much as I probably can add right now. Tom, you got anything?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, well, maybe the answer to your first question too, Zach, the very little impact on the U.S. cases from the acquisitions as we mentioned a minute ago. So those numbers were basically kind of organic growth numbers. And the only thing I'd add on Brakes is that we think the team's off to a really good start. Bill mentioned the transformational initiatives they've been operating against are all moving along nicely, and I think we feel very comfortable with overall how that business is performing. And the UK certainly has got some bumpiness in their economy driven by a lot of things going on over there right now. I think we feel very comfortable with where they're at and how they're performing (26:09).", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. And I would just add, I mean you asked about the FX part of that. I mean, obviously, the weakening sterling certainly plays into this, so there is some FX impact on an aggregate basis for the organization. We had fairly minor impact from FX for this quarter.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just, I guess, let's all take it on a high level here on the operating environment. Could you comment on the \u2013 just a little bit about underlying restaurant trends with them being a little choppy, are you seeing any change to the competitive environment here particularly with the impact of deflation versus food away from home \u2013 or food at home widening a little bit? Are you seeing anything as far as just continued challenges for your customers and then competition from your peers?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Well, I think the challenges are what I'd referenced. You've got several quarters in a row now where traffic is actually down, and while the spend is up, it's not rising at the same rate it was rising. So there is clearly a softening out there. I mean whether it's because of the election or relative pricing between grocery store and restaurants, I'll let others kind of critique that. Look, I think there's ebbs and flows in any cycles of economies, and I think we're going through that right now. But I think it just puts a premium on quality operators both in terms of our customer bases as well as ourselves. I mean we feel good about what we're doing and we're doing everything we can to support our customers.", "As far as the competitive environment, I wouldn't say there's any change. It's acutely competitive, as we've talked about before, all different types of competitors out there. We feel we're very well positioned. It does play out differently in some markets, but overall I'd say it's about the same.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks so much. Really appreciate your time.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "So maybe starting a question for Tom. When you think about moving case growth back up, is there a lot of clear things you can do to help your customers stimulate demand or is it really more taking share from other distributors in the environment we're in today?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, John. Well, I'd say I'm not sure there's a lot work we can do to help stimulate demand. What we can do is make sure that each of our customers is operating as effectively as they can and that they've got obviously the right products and the right pricing so that they can be successful, but as far as stimulating demand into their \u2013 our traffic into their locations, that's a little bit harder, I think, from where we sit. But I think there's a lot we are doing to help them be successful, and I think that's what we continue to focus and we believe very strongly that's as much our responsibility as theirs to help ensure that they're healthy and effective in what they're doing, and obviously with the tools that we bring them every day, we think, makes a big difference there. What was the second part of your question?", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Well, it was really that \u2013 if you're going to get case growth back up, it's more market share driven, which I guess, do you think from what you can see, is your share \u2013 the rate at which you're taking share from others in this space, maybe the smaller guys, it looks like it's accelerating. Is that fair?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Well, I think it's hard for us to obviously know that directly because, as you know, lots of competitors in this environment. We certainly believe we're continuing to grow at least at the industry if not outpacing that. As we talked for the last couple of years, we've tried to focus our efforts in a couple of areas, one where there's natural growth taking place. We've talked in the past about some of the segments where you're seeing growth, whether it be the Hispanic/Latino segment out there where we've really focused some of our energy and efforts to provide support to those operators or certainly looking at geographies where we've got opportunities. So I think we continue to execute our strategy and we feel like it's working and that we're hopefully gaining share from lots of different places based on how well we're taking care of our customers.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "All right. And then just lastly, if you think about supermarket foodservice, maybe just remind us kind of relative size of that business for you, it's still pretty small, I think, and where you think as you look out three years, five years or longer, how much bigger can that get?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Well, it is still relatively small for us. I don't have the exact numbers from Technomic, but I think that they would say that that retail segment, I think, is about 7% of the market. If my guess is \u2013 my memory serves me right. And I think that for us we certainly have opportunity to grow there. I think it really is a matter of what's the best way for us to grow there. We talked a couple of years ago about our relationship with Kroger. We feel like we continue to have opportunity as they grow in that space. But I think it really comes down to how consumers decide to purchase their food away from home, and that retail segment certainly, I know, is a big focus for a lot of the retailers see if they can pick up maybe some more share from that consumer.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Curious if you could just talk a little bit about the local case growth. I know it's hard to really know exactly how much the market is growing there, but do you feel like you took some share there? I realize it slowed, but still pretty solid, so just any color around that 1.9%.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "As we just were talking, I feel like it really is hard. We don't have a good view of the entire market. I'd say what we continue to see is we're getting growth from new customers. We are seeing a little bit of softness in some of the penetration of existing customers. We think that might be driven by some of the more external information that's out there around restaurant traffic, but broadly speaking we feel like we're just serving the broader independent restaurant segment well, and as we do that, we probably are gaining some share, but it's really hard to tell exactly where that might be coming from.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Got it. And then I guess just another question on the three-year target, so I realize you may not be updating those or feel the need to update those, but I guess given that Brakes is now just a significant part of the story over the next couple of years, do you have any color just on how we should think about that three-year target with Brakes included?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Kelly, I'm going to start and I'm going let Joel give you a little more on this. So one of the reasons we are providing more detail at this time on this segment information is to make sure that we are clear on the International versus the U.S., and then what we will do \u2013 so we have a three-year target and we have a three-year goal, and we will continue to track that in calls like this and investor presentations periodically and give you some sense on where we are in that original goal for the businesses that existed at that time, and then how we're doing on the rest of it. So we're going to simultaneously track that three-year goal and also begin to build a new three-year plan here over the next few months, and then we'll put that out to you at some point in calendar 2017.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I think, Kelly, the thing I would add to that is it's just as a reminder. Part of this target was to be very clear with all of you in the way that we are holding ourselves accountable, the way you can ultimately hold us accountable is this very clear and specific target to the legacy business. And so as we go through this, again what you can expect from us is to continue to have a very clear delineation, again, of both how we look at the organization as a whole, but a continued very clear tracking on the things that we talked about on our original Investor Day, and again tracking our targets against that. So, that would be hopefully very clear and separate out for all of you.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Great. That makes sense. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey. Great. Thanks very much for taking my question, guys, and congrats on the nice quarter here. Just wanted to kind of reconcile, obviously we know that there were some puts and takes with Brakes and tax and all that type of stuff this quarter, but you did, several times of course, again say today about the softening from the macro, which you had alluded to last quarter as well. So I guess maybe anymore color you can give on that restaurant softness in terms of any particular types of customers or geographies, and kind of going forward, do you expect things to get kind of sequentially worse or more just kind of roughly stay around these levels which are off the kind of previous highs? Thanks.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, Vinny. I'll start. Look, the one thing I would point us to is on an adjusted basis, if you exclude the impact of Brakes, we grew our operating income 15%. And that's the fourth quarter in a row where we got double-digit increases on adjusted operating income. So I think what we feel good about and hopefully what that tells others is whether we've got 2.5% or 3% case growth or 1.5% to 2% case growth, we're doing everything we can on the top line as well as how we manage it from there to deliver on our commitment. And so at this point, we feel very good about how we're managing the environment.", "In terms of where it goes from here, I can just tell you, internally Tom and his team are very, very focused on penetration, on improved retention and where appropriate bringing on new quality customers. So we're doing everything we can in a disciplined way to grow that top line, but clearly it puts a premium on managing our expenses here and continue to find ways to price in a way that works for us as well as for our customers. So, that's the part we can control and influence. As far as where the market goes, it's really hard to call right now given everything that's going on in the country, but we're preparing for where we are at. I think to continue a while longer hopefully, it gets somewhat better, but we're not really \u2013 we're really not in the business of making those projections.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah, okay. Thanks, Bill. That's helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up on Brakes specifically. In the past, I think we're all kind of \u2013 given the impression that at this point at least it was more or less going to kind of stay on its own largely kind of be run separately over there. Can you guys, I know it's still early, but just kind of give us maybe more of a qualitative sense of kind of the last few months, how that overall integration is going and if you think there are opportunities to kind of bring it more under kind of one roof over time?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Again, the way we're looking at this strategically is, there's a lot of exciting things about Brakes. We talked about quality of their team, the part of Europe that they know bring us into and our ability to use that business as a platform for future acquisition growth and a lot of other things.", "So strategically the way we look at it is, it's a \u2013 along with Canada, it's a two foundational parts of our international business, and we expected to continue to grow and to allow us to continue to find ways to do acquisitions, and that's basically it from my perspective. Joel, you want to add something?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I think what I would just say for maybe a little bit of color, I mean, we certainly have regular ongoing conversation in the business reviews with their team, but again, as Bill mentioned, just to remind you, when we talked about this deal initially, it's again, they have a very strong management team, we feel really good about their people and the work that they're doing that continue to transform their business.", "We certainly see that, again, as an opportunity to run that business stand-alone. Again, there's minimal overlap in the business we have. We certainly continue to look for opportunities though to bring upside in the deal. But, I would just tell you, again, a lot of good ongoing dialogue, but certainly we got a strong management team running that business as a stand-alone entity.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks very much, guys. Good luck.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about gross margin excluding Brakes. It's still up very significantly in the quarter, and so I wanted to get your sense on what were the key drivers? You mentioned four. How would you rank them during the quarter specifically and also how did deflation impact the gross margin this quarter? Thank you.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Good morning. So, this is Tom. Let me \u2013 I did talk about four different drivers, and I think we continue to believe each of those is contributing to the work we're doing. It's hard to pull out the deflation component. We know it certainly impacts the gross margin percent, but it's also I think probably most important to think about those other three areas that we're focused on, because that's how we manage the dollar side of it.", "Category management continues to be very positive for us. As you know, we've been basically in that operating model now for the last three years, and it's \u2013 well we've gone through I'd say the major cycle with that, we continue to work with our suppliers and we look at long-term partnerships that continue to provide value for us, and ultimately for our customers. So category management continues to be a very important part of what we do and how we operate.", "Revenue management has been something that now is fully deployed within our organization and I think we've got a really good set of processes and tools and ultimately routines for our sales and merchandising teams to leverage in the marketplace, and it allows us to be I think a little quicker on our feet, and be able to do the things that we need to do to make sure that our customers pricing is right on a regular basis, and it's driving really more consistency for our customers as well.", "And then lastly, partly with the work we do in category management, but a continued focus on Sysco brand, which brings value also to our customers and obviously delivers additional profitability for Sysco has been a key driver for us, and we continue to see improvement within our local customers, with our local business, and we again saw an improvement in Sysco brand this last quarter. So it really is a combination of all of those, and it's hard for us to kind of tease apart each of them individually, but I can tell you that each of them is definitely playing a role.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "The only thing I would add there Marisa is, the thing I feel the best about here is going back to Tom's prepared comments, we grew the gross profit dollars over 4% in U.S. Foodservice business, and so deflation hurts you when you talk about gross profit dollars. So, all those things Tom just outlined I think are all key reasons why we were able to do that in an environment where you're looking at a meaningful deflation.", "Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And if I could just follow-up on the revenue management, now that it's fully deployed, when do you anticipate seeing more of the benefit flow-through?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Well, I think it's \u2013 when I say it's fully deployed, I mean, it's been out there now for a couple of quarters, and so I think we're seeing the benefits right now. If the question is, does that have an endpoint? I think it's too early to even know that. It's an ongoing process that we follow now, and I think it's really more about being disciplined and how we approach pricing in the marketplace.", "Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah, good morning. And, Bill, just kind of sticking with the gross profit dollar growth subject here, when I think about your $500 million EBIT growth goal for over the next three years or through 2018, if you will, can you remind me what the inflation or deflation assumption was originally?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, the original model, and I will take it, this is Joel, that was about a 2%. If you recall, we had a differential between our volume and sales growth that we rolled out. We initially talked about at a 2% rate.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then I guess suppose following up to that, now that we're in our fifth quarter of consecutive deflation, but also considering how well you guys have been driving your gross profit dollar growth despite this backdrop, how do we think about kind of you guys reaching that ultimate goal? I believe the original mix was somewhere 55% to 65% of that $500 million EBIT growth goal came from a gross profit dollar growth?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yes, I think I will take \u2013 I will start with that, I think, you guys can add in. I think we're still looking of that in a relatively consistent way as we had initially outlined. I think the real important part of this though is to \u2013 one of the things we've talked about a bit externally is this gap or this delta between our growth in gross profit dollars and our growth in expense dollars. And so one of the things \u2013 again, we've certainly done a good job of managing through this deflationary times and still continued to grow our growth in gross profit dollars.", "We've also done a good job, I think of focusing and driving expenses downward as both Bill and Tom have talked about. And I think, when we looked at that plan and sort of the puts and takes of what was going to drive it, we certainly knew there are \u2013 we could've had more inflation, could've had less inflation, some of those factors are what they are, but the reality of it is our continued focus on that gap and that delta between those two numbers I think is really important.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I think where we're at right now and I think where we've been to your point over the last few quarters is, we're not on track to hit the sales number, okay? I think in that original goal, we were looking at 4% sales growth with two points of inflation and directionally about the same amount of GP growth. So we've got to get the GP a different way, and that's what we've been able to do here so far. We're really encouraged by that as well as managing the expenses, so I think it's more of a play on the top line than anything else.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, just the one final thing I'd add to that is the \u2013 if you recall when we increased our targets from $400 million to $500 million, that was again primarily driven by some change in some of the way we viewed our expenses. And so, again, if you want to look at that shift again a little bit it was, again, as I mentioned earlier, a pretty good system over the top, it was again a little bit more of a shift towards some of the expense side as we roll out when we increased our targets.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "Right. That's helpful. And then just a quick housekeeping one for you, Joel. What's the reasonable tax rate to be assuming on a go-forward?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, so I think at the end of last year we guided somewhere in the 35% to 36% range. So with some of the \u2013 one of the things we've talked about of this was actually a tax law change in the UK that moved the statutory rate essentially from 18% to 17%. I would say that would take our view of that probably on the low-end of the guidance that we put out before.", "A couple of things in this quarter that again we called out that we are seeing some one-time deals, and so I would say the rates you see in this quarter is a bit lower than you should anticipate going forward. But I think the low end of our guidance is probably a fair way to look at that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is now open.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Yeah, hi. I had a question on the currency impact. I think, Joel, you mentioned that the impact overall wasn't that significant in the quarter, and my understanding is that any hedges that were in place were terminated at the end of last year. And I'm also sure that you're very well aware that there was a pretty dramatic swing in the exchange rate for the pound year-over-year during the quarter. So can you give any more color on why there wasn't any significant drag from currency in the quarter? I would've assumed that earnings would have been better without the currency impact, but I'm just surprised that you're saying there really wasn't that much of an impact at all?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I think, Ajay, I mean, the point I was really making is \u2013 without a doubt, I mean, you're correct in your statement regarding the hedges. I think if you think about the magnitude of the Brakes business as a percentage of our entire business, it's really where my comment was targeted at.", "What we've talked about over the past few quarters was a difference that was primarily driven by the Canadian exchange rate, but that has pretty much mitigated frankly, and again if you think about that business as a percentage of our total, certainly the Brakes earnings would've been higher and if you factor the weakness of the sterling in, but I guess my comment was really on the whole organization, the overall impact wasn't that significant.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "I mean, to Joel's point, you're talking about 65% of 10% of the business.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Right.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Got it. And I also just wanted to follow-up on the earlier questions on the three-year plan, and maybe I'll just frame my question a little differently. So I know you're going to be giving an update later in the year, but since you are tracking your progress pretty closely, can you just at least confirm where the things are right now on a run rate basis relative to that $500 million growth target? So if you were to give a current snapshot, can you confirm whether you're comfortably ahead of plan or if there's still supposed to be kind of like more back-ended loaded assumptions on those three-year objectives? Thanks.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "As I said, I feel good about where we're at. We're five quarters into it. We've been trending 10% to 15% earnings growth every quarter, that's consistent with the plan. We've got some benefit next year with the depreciation as it relates to the business technology. So from where I sit, I would say we're comfortably on track right now and looking to reassess here at the end of second quarter.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I think the way, and I'll just add to that, I mean, I think at the end of last year we've talked about some initial percentage targets. I think at the end of last year we were slightly ahead of those targets. I think what we've talked about, though, and again, we had a strong quarter this quarter, but on an ongoing basis we've \u2013 I've said it, Bill said it before, I mean we'd certainly like to get a couple of quarters under our belt before we think about doing anything differently there. And so that's really the way I would think about our progress. We're feeling good, we're in a good place, but let's see how this plays out.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay. And finally, how would you describe if you could comment on the case volume trends at Brakes year-over-year in the UK market in particular? I mean, can you confirm if they were positive or negative?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Again, we've got an international segment. We're going to give you some color on the components of that. I would tell you that their business softened through the calendar year even before Brexit, and I think it's more about just the uncertainty in that economy, whether it was leading up to Brexit or post-Brexit. And if you read all the different accounts, so far it hasn't been as bad perhaps as people thought it might have been and I think we're seeing that as well.", "On the other hand, there's still a lot of uncertainty here over the next two years or three years. So, I think as Tom said in his prepared remarks, I think they performed reasonably well given the environment.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thank you. One quick one and then one question, if I may. Firstly, there seems to be some confusion about what non-GAAP D&A should be for the business in 2017 and maybe even 2018. Bill, I think in the last question you mentioned some technology write-off that you had done recently that may benefit that D&A line, but I hate to ask such a specific question, because a lot of people are \u2013 do have some really different estimates. Can you give us a little more specific help on that specific line?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Well, so let me start with that, and then so I'll take a couple of things on that. So one of the things you'll see are certain item, reconciliation this quarter is that, you can see this in our Q, our D&A is up a bit for this quarter for a couple of different reasons. Number one, as we talked about last year, we actually expected some due to the write-off of the SAP system, there was an acceleration of the amortization related to that, and so there is again say roughly $30 million I'd say of a certain item related to that issue that's part of our D&A. There's also as a result of the Brakes deal, there is both additional depreciation and amortization as a part of that. And so I think if you look at our overall D&A expense for this particular quarter relative to where we've been, those are really the two primary contributors on that line as it relates to this.", "What Bill was referring to as in his comment earlier, if you recall at the time when we increased our targets from $400 million to $500 million at a while back, we had made a couple of comments as it relates to that. Number one was the fact that a component of that difference was related to the fact that we \u2013 it was a changeover in our technology strategy, that there'd be some benefits once again the asset was fully written off. Again, there is accelerated amortization we will be experiencing at the end of last year and through this year, but there'd be benefit of that starting in 2018.", "So I think that's really what Bill was relating to on that, and so hopefully that gives you some clarity on some of the comments and a little bit of a break down on that. But you should expect that accelerated amortization from that plus the Brakes to be present throughout the rest of this year.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "I can confirm that's what I was relating to.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yes. Okay. Thank you, and I think I did understand that. But I think if you look at Street estimates you'll see that people have some pretty different estimates for D&A, like unusually different estimates for D&A in 2017 and 2018, and that's why I was wondering if you're willing to just give a little bit more specific guidance on that one specific line?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I mean, look, I think you guys need to adjust this quarter, go through a certain item schedule, work with Neil, and I would expect it will get more consistency there.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. We will do our best as always. And then the next question, obviously the restaurant industry just speaking from an operator perspective, slower traffic, higher labor cost, I mean, it's one of the obvious things that a restaurant company does is come to their food supplier and try to get as low as prices as possible. Are you seeing your restaurant customers may be asking even more from you than they have in the past, even if they see your gross margin results may ask you to get some of the gross margin back to them as they try to protect their own profitability?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Well, this is Tom. So I would say, John, a couple of things, as we said earlier, it continues to be very competitive out there, whether it's a chain restaurant customer or a street customer for us. And I think the way we try to look at value we bring to those customers is certainly beyond just price. We offer a wide range of obviously products and services to these folks. We believe we bring them value each and every day.", "We talked a little bit about Sysco brand earlier, Sysco brand is a great example of where we're able to bring basically lower cost of goods to our customers, and put them in a position where they can earn as much as they can from their offering.", "But it's well beyond just products and pricing, and so I would say it's the whole portfolio of things we bring to them that's allowed us to be successful, and certainly what we believe is the right strategy for us going forward. But it doesn't take away from the fact that it's competitive out there each and every day, and we just have to make sure that we're doing those right things in the market. We absolutely believe we need to be price competitive and that's one of the components of what we focus on.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "And I think, John, just to reinforce that, this is happening in an environment of two points of deflation right now, so the customers, they're benefiting from a food cost deflation. What we're doing and what Tom addressed earlier with the revenue management is using a lot of tools to be more consistent, more targeted in our pricing. But we still need to compete, as he points out, every day for that business.", "And interestingly to me, on the data that we see, to your point, whether benefiting from deflation, they've got some labor pressures, they've been out there for a while now, but the restaurants as a group continue to pass long about a two-point increase to their customers, and that has been incredibly consistent through every cycle that we've seen here.", "So, I think right now they're managing it pretty well and the deflation is helping them. At some point, I guess it could become more acute if we were to see the deflation reverse, but as I think as Joel pointed out, we don't see that happening here, at least not in this calendar year.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions in queue.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "Thank you. Neil Russell, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications, you may begin your conference.", "Neil A. Russell - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and thank you for your interest in Sysco. With me in Houston today are Bill DeLaney, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Ben\u00e9, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations, or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner.", "Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Earlier in this morning, Sysco reported strong financial results for our third fiscal quarter. Specifically, sales increased 13% year-over-year to $13.5 billion, driven both by a 3.5% local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business and new sales from our Brakes business which we acquired last July at the beginning of our fiscal year. Adjusted operating income grew 14% to $500 million, and adjusted earnings per share grew 11% to $0.51.", "Our results for the quarter reflect excellent performance across a majority of our businesses and build upon our increasingly strong and consistent performance over the past few years. These results were driven by our 65,000 dedicated associates successfully and cohesively executing Sysco's customer-centric strategy at a high level. Further, these results were achieved in markets that for the most part are experiencing modest economic growth and stable employment levels.", "While the energy-related downturn has resulted in regional economic headwinds in certain areas of the United States and Canada and political developments continue to contribute to economic uncertainty in some of the countries we operate in, overall consumer confidence generally remains favorable. Our business strategy is predicated on disciplined, profitable, and sustainable growth with particular emphasis on the following pillars: utilizing customer insights to enrich our customers' experience with Sysco; continuously improving productivity in all areas of our business; enhancing our product, service, and business solution offerings; and leveraging our talented associates while further developing our rich culture.", "In recent years, we have made tremendous strides in more effectively and consistently executing the specific initiatives developed pursuant to this strategy. By putting our customers first and embracing the right kind of properly-paced impactful change, we've built a foundation that has both supported our improved business performance and positions us well for continuous improvement as we move forward.", "The other key pillar of our business strategy is to continually assess new market opportunities for profitable, long-term growth. To that end, we see many exciting opportunities ahead for our international business in Canada, Latin America, and Europe.", "In closing, I am encouraged by the strong, positive momentum we currently have in our business and am pleased to report that we remain on track to achieve our recently upwardly revised adjusted operating income growth target through fiscal 2018. In addition, we are also in the process of developing Sysco's new three-year plan through fiscal 2020, and look forward to sharing that publicly later in the calendar year.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional discussion about our recent business results.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, our associates are executing at a high level as we continue to deliver on the key strategic levers of our three-year plan: delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, growing gross profit dollars, and managing overall expenses.", "This morning, I'd like to discuss our segment results with a focus on U.S. Foodservice Operations and International Foodservice Operations. I will also highlight some of the key strategic initiatives of our U.S. business that are helping us to differentiate Sysco in the marketplace.", "Starting with our quarterly results for U.S. Foodservice Operations, sales grew 2.2% and gross profit had growth of 4%, while adjusted operating expenses grew 2.3%, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 7%. Overall, our U.S. Foodservice segment had a strong quarter. We experienced strong growth in our local business as we accelerated case growth to 3.5%, which was partially offset by declines in case volume for our multi-unit business, resulting in 1.8% total case growth.", "Importantly, as we strive to deliver disciplined, profitable growth as a part of our three-year plan, our continued focus on providing value to our local customers through innovative product offerings and value-added services, along with improved e-commerce capabilities, has enabled our growth with these customers for the 12th quarter in a row.", "Looking at gross profit growth for U.S. Foodservice Operations, we delivered growth of 4% and gross margin expansion of 35 basis points as we continue to manage the deflationary environment well. As you all know, the industry has been in a deflationary environment for an unprecedented six consecutive quarters, and that trend is finally beginning to shift toward inflation. Meat prices are abating, and dairy and produce prices have begun to rise. Based on those changes, we are anticipating overall modest inflation in the fourth quarter.", "Our strategy around accelerating growth with local customers is working. Over the last several quarters, we've improved the capabilities of our sales force through investments made in training, technology, and targeted resources. And as a result, our marketing associates are spending more time selling and focusing on delivering benefits to our customers versus spending time on non-value-added activities.", "In addition, our insights-based approach to understanding and meeting our customers' needs continues to guide our efforts. As an example, one of the insights we've received from customers was around providing healthier product options. In response, we created a good-to-grow promotion during the third quarter that highlighted the large variety of fresh and healthy produce options available to our customers. Furthermore, we brought innovative products to market through our Cutting Edge Solutions program. This program introduces new product ideas to customers, which can help them reduce labor costs and/or improve the quality of their menu offering. These are just a few of the programs that have translated into improving loyalty scores for Sysco this past year. We are committed to delivering value to our customers while also providing a more consistent experience of doing business with us.", "From a cost perspective within U.S. Foodservice Operations, our expense management was solid as we limited growth to 2.3% on an adjusted basis for the quarter. Looking at U.S. Broadline, cost per case improved by approximately $0.02 compared to the prior year. And on a fuel price-neutral basis, cost per case improved by $0.01, ahead of our three-year plan objective.", "In our supply chain area, we are seeing positive momentum from our productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements which are driving efficiencies. One example is our slotting initiative that's helping our warehouses to build pallets faster and more accurately.", "In the area of delivery, we are seeing progress in improved routing and delivery metrics through the leverage of enhanced technology. While there's still a lot more work to be done, we are seeing improved operating expense trends, and we are focused on continuing this performance throughout the balance of the fiscal year.", "Additionally, we are continuing to thoughtfully manage our administrative expenses through a more consistent approach that is improving our overall efficiency while maintaining service level to our customers. Looking at the overall performance for U.S. Foodservice Operations, I'm very pleased with our level of execution, which enables us to deliver solid operating income growth and improved operating margins by 34 basis points.", "Moving to International Foodservice Operations, sales were up $1.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased $6.6 million, both driven largely by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group. During the quarter, Brakes performed well amidst a challenging environment in the U.K. and is continuing to make progress in their supply chain transformational efforts. Growth in France remains steady, and Sweden continues to produce favorable results. Additionally, we continue to see opportunities for growth across our European business. Lastly, although we are in the early days of integrating our Ireland businesses, things are progressing well, and we expect to achieve modest benefits from that integration.", "Looking to Canada, we are pleased with our performance despite the continued softness in Alberta which has been driven primarily by the energy market decline. Our Canadian business overall is leveraging the many learnings and successes of our U.S.-focused initiatives and is now implementing many of them. For example, we've introduced the category management and revenue management processes, and we are offering multi-channel ordering via online and telephony, as we provide our customers the ability to choose how they order from Sysco. These initiatives are a few examples of how we are enhancing our customers' experience, as we support the growth of our local business.", "In addition, we are effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity. As a result, we expect the Canadian business to continue to deliver improving positive performance.", "Turning to Latin America, we are excited about new facilities in both Costa Rica and Panama. Specifically in Costa Rica, we have opened 180,000-square foot, state-of-the-art facility with a test kitchen and training facilities. This new space will enable new products and full product lines to be available to our customers, and we're excited about the accelerated growth potential those offerings will deliver.", "In summary, our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution, and delivering our financial objectives as a part of our three-year plan.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade for further details.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the third quarter. Our ongoing quality of earnings growth reflects continued momentum from our business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth, and good cost management.", "This morning, I like to cover our third quarter results for the company both excluding and including Brakes. For the purpose of comparing to our three-year plan, I'll start with our quarterly results excluding Brakes where we delivered sales growth of 2.3%, gross profit growth of 4.3%, which included margin expansion of 34 basis points, and adjusted operating expense growth of 1.9%, resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 13.6%.", "We continued to maintain the gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth above 2%, which translated into strong adjusted operating income leverage and continued progress toward achieving our three-year plan objectives. As Tom mentioned earlier, we now expect modest inflation for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 in our U.S. Broadline business. While it is important to note that this change from deflation to inflation can pressure gross margin as a percentage of sales, we do not anticipate inflation to negatively impact our ability to grow gross profit dollars.", "Shifting gears, I like to transition to our results for the quarter including Brakes. Sales grew 12.7%, and gross profit dollars grew 18.3%, while adjusted operating expenses grew 19.3%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 14.3%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 10.9%. On an adjusted basis, our Brakes Group operations contributed approximately $0.01 per share to our consolidated earnings per share this quarter. As Tom noted earlier, Brakes performed well during the quarter and continues to make progress in their transformational efforts.", "The reason the performance was accretive rather than dilutive, which was our original expectation for the third quarter, was largely related to changes in deferred taxes for our European business. Additionally, there are negative tax impacts to our domestic business, also driven by changes in deferred taxes. As a result, our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35%, compared to 34.3% in the prior-year period. These changes, along with increased interest expense, ultimately impacted our adjusted earnings per share growth of 10.9%.", "Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2017, which was $36 million higher compared to the same period last year. Free cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2017 was $630 million which was $11 million lower compared to the same period last year. These changes are largely due to improved business performance, improved working capital, and favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the US Foods termination payment last year, offset by higher cash taxes from deductions related to the US Foods settlement and a deferral from flood relief.", "Net CapEx for the first 39 weeks was $395 million. We now expect the total CapEx for FY 2017 to be in the range of approximately 1% to 1.1% of total sales, slightly above our previous guidance. Investments have been related to capital improvements in the business, including supply chain opportunities at Brakes.", "Net working capital performance has continued to improve. We have improved net DSO by 2.7 days compared to fiscal year 2015, driven by improvements in all three areas: payables, receivables and inventory. As a reminder, we are measuring these results ex-Brakes, consistent with our three-year planned targets.", "Our third quarter results include certain items that were related to the Brakes acquisition, including amortization associated with the transaction and accelerated depreciation related to our revised business technology strategy. As a reminder, the accelerated depreciation will continue through the end of fiscal 2017.", "One last item before closing. This month, Sysco voluntarily withdrew from a multi-employer pension plan previously disclosed in our 10-K, and has recorded a $35.6 million withdrawal liability subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We consider this fourth quarter charge to operating expense as a certain item.", "In summary, we had another high-quality quarter reflecting continued momentum from our business, including strong local case growth, solid gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business, which will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term.", "Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO capital. Your line is open.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the independence, I guess, a little bit. Always hard to gauge, but with 3.5% growth there, very strong. I was just curious if you feel like you gained some share there with that customer this quarter, and anything to call out that you think is driving that that you're doing or regional trends or types of restaurants that are really kind of outperforming among that group.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, good morning, Kelly. It's Tom. Thanks for the question. So, let's start with \u2013 I think we feel really good about the work we've continued to do in this segment. And if you think about where we said we'd be on our three-year plan, we're right where we've said we would be, which is around 2.5% local case growth. So, obviously, good quarter this quarter. And what I would say is I think over the three-year time, our goal was to continue to gain share in this space, and I feel like we continue to make progress there. But I think what I'd attribute it to is continued just execution of our strategy. If you think about these customers, we've been very focused on them. I think our value proposition is resonating with them. And I think based on that, we're seeing more and more customers support Sysco and partner with us.", "If you think about new business growth, we're also seeing some new business growth in this space. But overall, I would say it's really just more consistent continuation of the work we've been doing, and I think we're seeing the recognition of that effort with these customers.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Great. And then, I guess just to follow up on that with the core gross margin expansion of 34 basis points, I guess a little bit slower than the past couple quarters. So, can you comment a little bit more on the drivers there and also elaborate on that comment about potentially the return of inflation maybe weighing on gross profit margin percentage but not impacting gross dollar profit growth? I think there's still a lot of confusion on that front, if you could talk about that a little bit.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Okay, I'll start and then I'll toss it to Joel for some of the further discussion around the deflation and inflation. So, I think gross margin percentage, yes, it probably slowed a little bit versus where we've been, but I think still very strong. And I think you are starting to see a little bit of impact of that starting to move from deflation to inflation that could be impacting that. But just as a reminder, the areas we continue to talk about regarding gross margin improvement are the category management effort we've had for a few years now, continued improvement in Sysco Brands. So, you saw again additional growth in Sysco Brand with our local customers. Obviously, that shift of mix to higher local case growth versus corporate multi-unit is going to impact that as well.", "And then, obviously, now revenue management is kind of part of the way we operate day in and day out. So, I think those are all key drivers, what continues even as we start to see a little bit of slowing of the deflationary environment start to happen.", "Why don't I toss it to Joel? He can talk a little bit about some of the categories that are starting to shift a bit. You heard me talk a little bit about it and then maybe just idea of gross margin dollars versus just gross margin percent.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, so, Kelly, the question you asked in terms of the impacts, yeah, just as a reminder, the deflation tends to impact the margin percentage, and so we've seen some benefits over the last few quarters that we've called out the impact of deflation on our margin percentage. But we typically would see that as a headwind in terms of the gross profit dollars. As we shift to more modestly inflationary environment, one of the things I think you \u2013 again, and certainly I called this out in my script as well, we do anticipate some impact on the margin percentage, which we began to see in this quarter, but we certainly also do not consider that an impediment to growth in our gross profit dollars.", "And so, again, we've talked oftentimes in this industry that a couple percent of inflation is what we would view as the \u2013 some of the optimal state. In other words, so an opportunity where costs that come through to us, we can pass to our customers, our customers can pass to theirs. And so, I wouldn't look at this more the return of inflation in a negative way. Again, gross profit dollars, we certainly feel good about our ability to generate. Again, we may see erosion in our margins.", "To Tom's point, in terms of product categories, just remember again, we talk about one number, but it's certainly made up of a lot of different product categories. And some of the things that you're seeing here is some lesser level of deflation in our meat area, though that area still is deflating. But other areas such as produce, and we've seen some in bacon and other product categories that are continuing to actually accelerate in their inflationary characteristics. And so, all told, again, looking at some more modest levels of inflation as we head into the fourth quarter.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Kelly, this is Bill. I just would add that in addition to everything these guys just took you through, we're now talking about gross margin improvement over gross margin improvement. So, there's a little bit of math in this thing right now in terms of year-over-year comparisons. So, we're actually quite pleased with the performance. And to Joel's point, I think the 4% gross profit dollar growth we feel very good about, and that's been a target of ours. And so, I think whether it's modest deflation or modest inflation, we certainly want to stay locked in on growing the gross profit dollars. So, I would just say that as we get back into some modest inflation, if we can hold the margins flat, little up, little down, that type of thing, I think we'll be pleased with that. And you should see a very good gross profit dollar growth.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Just wondering, given the growth that you're seeing, and I mean it looks like the momentum is here to stay for a little bit. Can you just give us an update on where you're at from a capacity perspective? How much more whittling down, I guess, you have to do with some of your less profitable customers? And then, I had a follow-up.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Good morning, Karen. This is Tom. So, I assume when you say capacity, you're just talking about overall warehouse capacity?", "Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "And so, I would say we are fine in that regard. You heard me talk kind of over the quarters about different efforts we're talking where we may have some capacity constraints to get more capacity out of our facilities and more throughput, and a lot of those initiatives in our supply chain area have been working very well. So, we're going to continue to focus on those where we have challenges. But we think we feel very comfortable at this point about our ability to not only handle our existing customers but continue to grow this business within our current footprint.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "I think one of the things you did hear \u2013 Karen, it's Joel \u2013 from us also is this approach to a disciplined approach to growth. And certainly, part of that is around the idea of a very thoughtful and carefully thinking about opportunities where they may exist to either add or retain, and how that fits in with the overall network of facilities that we have. So, again, certainly, something we do consider. But again, as Tom said, I think we're in a decent place there.", "Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then, I just wanted to switch gears to SYGMA for a second. Because SYGMA was up, I mean, decently on tougher comparisons. So, wondering what kind of drove that shift suddenly in the quarter.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Well, you heard me talk over the first couple quarters about some of the challenges we've had in the SYGMA business. And some of that had to do with some of the operational aspects of the business specific to certain customers, and also the deflationary environment we've seen. So, I think as you start to see some of that deflation slowing as we talk, there's some benefit we're seeing there. And we continue to focus on improving our operational effectiveness. I'd say that those are probably the two biggest drivers of the kind of shift in our performance, although I would say while we feel better about the quarter, we still feel like we have a lot of opportunity in the SYGMA side of the business.", "Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start with some operational expenses, including Brakes. They came in a little bit higher than expected. How much of that was Brakes, and is there anything else to note during the quarter that might have drove higher OpEx?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "No. I mean, I think part of what you may be seeing in the Brakes, again, if you remember there is some seasonality in that business. And so, some of the things you see there is just on a smaller base of business as a higher relative expense. But I \u2013 I would not say there's anything of any significance there at all in terms of that comparison. It's really more related to what I talked about there in the smaller business. I think we're very pleased overall with our expense performance.", "Again, we maintained a gap in our overall business in the nearly 2.5% to 2.5 points between our gross profit dollar growth or operating expense growth. Again, as Tom pointed out, on a cost per case basis with our U.S. Broadline, we came in actually, on a fuel adjusted basis, $0.01 better, which is actually a little better than the goal we talked about of a flat cost per case. So, in general, I would just tell you what you're seeing there again is a little bit more reflective of the smaller businesses seasonality as it is anything else. But overall, we're very pleased with the expense results.", "Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And if I could just follow up on the topic of deflation. As you've started to see it come back in some categories like dairy or produce, have you been able to pass along the higher product cost to your customers? And are you generally seeing rationality in the \u2013 amongst your competition when it comes to passing through the return of inflation?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "This is Tom. Yeah, I'd say, Marisa, that we're \u2013 again, we're talking about mild numbers at this point, and as Joel said earlier, this industry historically, I think, operates pretty well at these kind of lower inflation levels. So, we're not seeing anything that would concern us right now about our ability to pass along those prices. I mean, in the category like produce, when you get some of the weather issues they had in California earlier this year, you'll get some spikes in certain areas that have to be kind of managed closely. But generally speaking, we feel fine about how it's affecting the business right now.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I would actually distinguish dairy and produce from other items in our mix. Those are very volatile items, dairy maybe even more than produce at times. So, I think in the course of 12 months, Marisa, you could see those go up and down within that period. As I think we alluded to, the meat, center-of-plate items, obviously, high dollar boxes there. They drive a lot of this thing over the medium to long term. Still some modest deflation going on in the meat side, but we would expect that to continue to turn in that direction as well. So, I would look more in terms of long-term thoughts on deflation more in terms of wait and see on the center-of-plate items. And I think dairy and produce will, for other reasons, be up and down from time to time.", "Marisa C. Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, good morning. So, I guess, I'm just looking to tackle capital allocation here. I think you've essentially exhausted your $3 billion ASR at this point. Can you just remind us of what you have remaining for just general buyback programs and then potentially update us on your order of importance when it comes to capital allocation?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Sure, be happy to. So, we think about capital allocation really in number of few key priorities, starting with investing in our business. And so, certainly technologies, facilities, fleets, et cetera, those are the kinds of things that, as we talked about today, actually are getting our CapEx numbers even up slightly, and that certainly reflects our continued emphasis on reinvesting in our business as a key priority. Certainly, dividend was a key part of our strategy that obviously is very important to a large part of our investor base, and remain committed to growth in our dividend as we have over a long time in this company.", "Pursuing strategic M&A, and both in our core space and adjacencies and additional geographies certainly remains a key focus of this company. And then, to the points you're bringing up, again what I call a balanced view between paying down debt and buying back shares is really the other key component of our capital allocation. I think the question specifically you asked, so just as a key point, we're a good majority of the way through the two-year $3 billion ASR that we announced a couple years ago, following the termination of the US Foods merger. I would call our share repurchase strategy opportunistic. That would certainly fall into that category. And in addition to that type of repurchase, we also, as a reminder, do continually repurchase shares to offset option dilution. So, hopefully, that...", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Yeah. And then, I guess, just my second question as it relates to case growth itself. If I recall in the last earnings call, you guys were actually sounding a bit cautious heading into this quarter itself. But obviously with the results, they were really quite impressive and must have seen some nice acceleration in the month of March. I'm just curious if you can provide any real color on the case growth cadence and if you've seen some continued trends quarter-to-date.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I'll start here, Chris. And kick it to Tom, since I'm usually the one who's most cautious. So, part of the reason for the caution, we had had a couple quarters where we were between 1.5% to 2% case growth. And we were heading into a quarter, being the March quarter, that's a hard quarter to predict early in the quarter, March, because of the seasonality within the quarter, March is a big, big percentage of the overall sales and earnings. And we'd had a pretty mild winter the year before. So, we were a little bit cautious. At the same time, the point I made and I will continue to make, Tom mentioned it as well in his prepared comments, is we feel very good where we are in the three-year plan, and frankly, where we are in our plan for this year. We're running about 2.5% local case growth over the seven quarters now and over the three quarters for this year.", "And we would love for people to kind of look at us the way we look at the business, which is we've got a three-year plan and it'll be a rolling three-year plan over time. And there's going to be some ebbs and flows in any individual quarter or even couple quarters in a row. But overall, we're running this business certainly for the long term, but also understanding that we've got some three-year financial objectives out there. So, we're very pleased with what we're seeing here. We've got some good momentum, as we said in our earlier comments. And I'll let Tom give you a little more color on that.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Chris, I think the only thing I'd really add was more \u2013 and some of that caution might have also been around the corporate multi-unit because at the time, we had been slowing in that area. We obviously rely heavily on how each of those concepts themselves perform. And so, I think that's always something that we are thoughtful about as we go into any quarter. So, I don't think there's much else to add to what Bill said. I think we feel really good about where we're at, and I feel like we've got good momentum which is important going forward.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "All right. Best of luck, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is open.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "So, maybe for Tom. When you look at the local case growth, roughly how much of that is coming from existing customers? Could it be two-thirds or 70% or something in that ballpark? And then, maybe talk a little bit about growing share with those existing customers going forward, both from other broadliners and then specialty distributors. Does one have more potential than the other?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, John, good morning. So, look, I think \u2013 let me say a couple things. One, I'd say, we definitely feel like we are improving our level of penetration with our customers, which is selling more to our existing customers. To give you a number on what percentage, I think that's probably a bit of a stretch and...", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "But I think we feel like we are continuing to further penetrate and gain our share of wallet with those customers. And we obviously are growing new customers and adding customers to the portfolio as well. So, I think we have a good balance of both of those working, and I think we feel really comfortable with where that's at. As far as where that's coming from, it comes from a lot of different places. It's hard to, again, peg, is it just in the specialty area? I think we continue to perform well in the specialty areas. But I also would say that the broadline business is really doing very well. And a lot of what you see is the sheer size of our broadline business especially in the U.S. That's where a lot of the growth is going to come from, is from more within our existing customers and certainly picking up some new business from other broadline competitors.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "John, the other thing I would add there, which kind of gets buried in these numbers as well is we're having the best year we've ever had on retention of local customers, off of a very good year last year. So, it's all of the above. You certainly always want to have new business coming in. But in addition to penetration, we're managing the current portfolio very well.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And then, maybe just shifting gears a little bit. On to Brakes, I guess we knew it was seasonal, maybe we didn't appreciate how seasonal. But you think about the amount of deleverage there, is it solely that deleverage or is there a mix issue as well? And does it have to be that seasonal? You sort of wonder, is there an opportunity for you to do things somewhat differently, and so it's not so skewed, 3Q versus the first half?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I mean, John, I think \u2013 I mean, first of all, this is Joel. I mean, this \u2013 as you know, it's our first full year of this acquisition.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Yeah.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "So, we're certainly seeing some of those things for ourselves for the first time as well. But I would just say, again, if \u2013 keep in mind, just in terms of the order of magnitude of the size of their business, there's certain fixed costs that size leverages in different ways. And so, I think there's always going to be an element of some of that. And I think that's \u2013 but certainly to your point, I mean, there are things that as we go along, we'll continue to find ways to try to take a little of that seasonality out. Now, we did anticipate it. Again, last quarter, we called it out that certainly the second half of what is our fiscal year is a weaker time for them, particularly in our third quarter. So, again, we certainly anticipated some of that. But again, over time we'll certainly get smarter there, and look to find ways to continue to drive a little less seasonality in the business. But it certainly is inherently there.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, John, I think on that one, to Joel's point, we need to get through 12 months with this business and kind of really understand their cycles. I think the top line probably will remain pretty seasonal. There's some CapEx we need to invest in over there. We need to better understand how they work with their big customers and their suppliers. So, I think over time there may be an opportunity for us to better understand, not just the seasonality, but the efficiency of some of these things and \u2013 so hopefully, as we get into the fourth quarter and we talk to you in August, we'll have a better handle on that. But I think, over the next year or so, it will still take some time to work through some of that, and we'll give you the best guidance that we can.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on the international front. Quite a bit of commentary upfront just around kind of the opportunities and the different geographies. Any further color you could provide at this point in terms of kind of either timing effort or capital that may be allocated to those, that would be great.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "I think I was the one who was so effusive upfront there, Vinny. So, I'll start. I think Tom hit on up some of it. I mean, we certainly feel good with some of the earnings momentum that we have up in Canada right now. We've had to go in there and obviously look at our cost structure pretty aggressively, and we continue to do that. As Tom also mentioned, some of the initiatives that we've rolled out now for a couple, three years, and four years really in cat man's case, we're looking at how to deploy those in Canada in a way that makes sense for that country and that market.", "And there's some things that we're already doing up there with the telephone sales and that type of thing. So, we're learning from Canada and vice versa. And so we feel good about that. The Latin American business, a couple joint ventures, Bahamas, smaller in scale but exciting in terms of what we see over the medium to long term down there in terms of growth potential, new facilities in Costa Rica and Panama, that kind of thing coming up. So, that's really what I was talking about.", "And then, we just talked about Brakes, and lot of opportunity in Brakes. There's going to be opportunities to certainly improve how we execute over there. I think there's going to be some investment opportunities. And at the same time, we still think from an acquisition platform standpoint, it's just a tremendous vehicle for us to do more in Europe over time.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, maybe just following up on that, Bill, and thank you for the commentary. Just on kind of on the international margin, I know you said, obviously seasonality, still early, still learning, Brakes specifically. But that it was a bit lower, of course, in 3Q. Anything else to call out outside of just kind of continuing to work through Brakes, and how we should just kind of generally think about that profitability in that line of business kind of on a go-forward basis?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "I don't think so right now. I'll let Joel weigh in. We're just now beginning our planning process for next year with them. So, I think as we finish up this year, like I said a minute ago and as we get into their planning process, to the extent that there're some nuances here or some things that we think we can maybe work with them to do better or differently, we'll certainly give you some guidance there. Joel?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, Bill, I actually don't really have anything else to add to that. I just think it's, in general, again \u2013 just always remember, again, order of magnitude, a little bit smaller businesses, so more impacted by some of the cost structure and smaller volume quarters. But other than that, there's \u2013 again, we'll keep getting smarter about this, as Bill said, and I talked about earlier. At least, again, we've had these people as part of our company now for not even a year yet, and so we'll continue to be able to refine our talking points around that and hopefully give you guys continued clarity as we go forward.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks, fellas.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Yeah, hi, guys, good morning.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Hi, Ed.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Bill, last quarter, obviously, the market hated the fact that your total case growth was roughly flat. And then, this quarter, it really kind of came back pretty good. You had talked about, post Q2, about the multi-unit side. And I think if I remember correctly, some business that didn't renew because you didn't like the pricing. Did something else happen this quarter? Was there a new business here to fill the void? Just thoughts around that. And then, as we think about total case growth going forward, I think what a lot of us were doing we're kind of assuming that you'd be flattish to up modestly for three quarters now. And it doesn't seem like that's going to be the case. So, I guess, how should we be thinking about this going forward? Was Q2 just an anomaly?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "I don't believe in anomalies. So, I won't say that. I can't say that with all of our people listening right now, Ed. But now, look, let me start, and I'll have Tom give you a little more color on the large account, what we call the CMU part of the math here in a little bit. But I think the way we should be thinking about it is the way we're trying to run it here, which is we've got these three-year targets, and we have an annual plan. And we bifurcate it today, because when we talk about disciplined, profitable, sustainable growth, we really run this thing, even though we run them out of our operating companies, we run them differently. And a lot of the large accounts, they're much more complex relationships and they're longer term generally. And there's going to be normal ebbs and flows in those negotiations as well. And while we've done a great job over the years growing that business, and frankly, retaining the business, when you do lose an account or two accounts, even if you are maybe the catalyst in that transition, i.e., Sysco, that's going to make an impact over, not just one quarter, but a couple quarters. And obviously, perpetually, you're always bringing on new business. Hopefully it's not four quarters, so you have a chance to mitigate it.", "So, I think you're seeing a little bit of that with the new business offsetting. I'll let Tom go there. I think the bigger point is more on the local side, which is we're looking to grow that, in the current three-year plan, 2.5% or more. And if you go back and look at Q1 and Q2, we were between 1.5% and 2%. So, we certainly weren't where we needed to be, and I think now you're seeing a strong quarter here in the third quarter. And so far, this quarter we're seeing similar types of results.", "So, when we talk about momentum, that's really what we're talking about there and our ability to leverage it. So, feel good about the local case growth, feel good about our ability to leverage it. Feel very good about where we are, relative to our three-year plan.", "And I just think the CMU side of it, the way I'd like you to think about it is we're managing this in a very disciplined way. We're not trying to get rid of customers. We're trying to work with customers in a way where we can grow, support their growth in a way that's profitable for both of us. But to the extent that there is turnover in that account base, it will impact the numbers a little more significantly.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I don't think I have really that much to add. I think Bill answered that pretty well. The only thing I'd go back to, we've said earlier around the local, is we feel like we're very focused on improving our share wallet with our existing customers, and we're seeing good momentum there. And then, sure, we're always looking at new business opportunities in that space. But I would say it's not anything unique or different this quarter than what we've been doing. I think we just feel like we've got good momentum, and we're continuing to execute our plan accordingly.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. And then, just one quick follow-up. And we're kind of beating a dead horse a little bit here, but it's probably worth it. As you think about inflation and deflation and your goal to drive gross profit dollar growth, a couple hundred basis points faster than SG&A, you would rather have an inflationary backdrop than a deflationary backdrop in order to achieve that, number one. And then, number two, sounds like you'd encourage us to really think more about, as we analyze you as a company, more about how you're achieving that gap and how you're growing gross profit dollars over really what your gross margin is doing in any given quarter. Is all that fair?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "I would say yes and yes. And on the first one, what we would prefer is modest inflation, let's call it low-single digit, Ed.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys. I'm curious if you have any thoughts on the disconnect between the improving consumer confidence trends, yet underlying restaurant traffic, particularly chains, looks to be pretty choppy. I'm curious if you think there's been any change out there with regard to the reallocation of consumer wallet. And if you see this variability as more temporary or if you think restaurant spending can reaccelerate from here going forward.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I'll take a stab at that, Zack. It's hard. I mean, it's hard to really get a handle on it. These trends aren't exactly new, so I think the traffic phenomenon, it's probably \u2013 it's been a few quarters now where we've seen somewhat less traffic. It's not dramatic, but a little bit less. But the nice thing is the check amount is covering that, and we're still seeing some real growth at the restaurant level. It obviously changes from subsegment to subsegment from quarter to quarter. And obviously, within the individual operators.", "I think the good news here is while there's consumer confidence or some of the other feedback we get from surveys we do with restaurant operators that we participate in, it is positive. So, I think you always want to be in an environment where people are looking forward or feeling better about things. And I think that's a good thing. So, if the economy can continue to at least move along even modestly and if that translates into our business, that will keep our customers positive and obviously that keeps the business in a good way. So, I think right now, we'll take it. It would be good to see a little more traffic. But the fact that people are positive is very good.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "The only thing, Zack \u2013 this is Joel \u2013 that I could add, just to remind you and others, yeah, and we certainly talk about restaurants, as we should, frequently. But always keep in mind, about a third of the business is actually outside of the restaurant space, as well. So, things like healthcare, thing \u2013 sports stadiums, universities. Those types of government institutions. And I only just say that as a reminder that some of the opportunity we have is part of Sysco's kind of what we've begun portfolio diversification, if you want to call it that, and the ability to have some level of buffering, if you want to call it that, and some of those trends. So, just as a reminder. No other comment there.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks, Joel. And I had a couple housekeeping items. Sorry, if I missed this. But what was the specific impact of deflation in the U.S. this quarter? And then, also, with respect to the volume uptick, was the U.S. Broadline all organic growth for the most part, or was there any small M&A or anything like that in there as well?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "So, I can take that. (50:16) I'll call it slightly deflationary for the quarter. And the other one I would consider \u2013 there's some M&A growth, not a large amount. So, it's considered mostly organic.", "Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Got it. Thanks, Joel. Appreciate the time, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Obviously, your cost per case continues to come down. Expense management has been pretty strong. Are you guys seeing any signs of the labor cost inflation in the U.S.? Any indications that you're seeing upward pressure on wages in any of your markets?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Well, certainly, our customers have been experiencing that for a year or two now. So, that's been one of the benefits of the deflation, is that we've been able to work with our customers well on that while they were incurring a fair amount of labor increase. As far as our labor costs go, to your point, Shane, we're managing it very aggressively. And I would say we're doing a decent job managing both the head count as well as the costs. So, we're keeping those in line. We're a heavily incentive-based company. So, when the company performs, our people do well, our sales people are on commission. So, it's a heavily incentivized cost structure here on the payroll side.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "I think the only thing I'd add \u2013 this is Tom \u2013 is that the minimum wage changes you might see around that Bill referenced that certainly impacted some of our customers, don't really impact us much because we're generally well above the minimum wage with all of our employees.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. And then, just a quick follow-up on your M&A outlook. I know that's \u2013 still you mentioned it was a strategic priority. What are you guys seeing today in terms of the M&A environment? Just any color you could give. Do you guys see a lot of willing sellers out there? And do you anticipate more opportunities over the next year?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "I think the first thing we see is a pretty wide open space for us, both domestically and international. So, it comes down to prioritization and just the right kind of acquisitions whether they're what we call fold-ins into our broadline, additional businesses that can complement the specialty companies that we have or international. So, there's plenty of opportunity.", "Obviously, over the last couple of years, three years, really we've been more locked in on some larger deals. So, we're remobilizing our team here to staff up for going out and being \u2013 if not more aggressive, certainly broader in our thinking up and down the line in terms of opportunities there, as I said. So, we think there's good opportunity. How that translates into (52:59) acquisitions, that's always a little bit more difficult to predict. You need willing sellers. You need an environment where they can take their proceeds and reinvest them in a way that works for them. But we think it's actually a very good environment right now for acquisitions.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Kirk with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you for taking the question. It sounds like you're pretty confident in your ability to pass food inflation to your customers. But how do you feel about their ability to then pass it on to the final consumer in the face of some of their existing traffic deceleration?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I think what we've seen over the years, and this really just comes from data that we see \u2013 industry data, that kind of thing, is that most restauranteurs and the restaurant industry in general, and then to Joel's point, that's only about 60% of our customer base or revenue stream. It's a very interesting phenomenon. Year in and year out, they pass on about 2%. And so, when you hear me talk about \u2013 and we've been saying this quite consistently for years. When you hear us talk about low-single digit or modest inflation being a good environment, that's good for our customers, and therefore, it's good for us. And so, I think if it stays at those levels, they should be able to pass it along reasonably well. If it were to go back up to the 4 or 5s, that becomes more difficult. And obviously, in our situation, you don't necessarily pass it all along every day. It depends on the category and that kind of thing. But within a reasonable period of time in a modest inflation environment, I would agree that we should be able to cover it.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "I think the only thing I'd add is just keep in mind, I mean, we are still in a deflationary point with meat. And again, a couple of the other categories. Again, we talk about dairy, produce, some of those, to Joel's point earlier, tend to be more volatile in general. So, again, I still think we're certainly in a decent place there. And again, certainly a modest inflation level is something we feel good about in this industry.", "William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. That's all for me. Thank you.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Yeah, hi, good morning. Obviously, with Brakes, you did better than expected in Q3. I was just wondering if you can give an update on your outlook for Brakes in the fourth quarter. To what degree you expect Brakes to be a net tailwind or a drag on earnings?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. So, thanks for the question. Yeah, it's \u2013 so, again, as we guided previously, we certainly anticipated that the second half of their year \u2013 again, certainly second half of our fiscal year, if you want to call it that, would be less favorable in terms of accretion than the first half, where we also \u2013 we talked about that as \u2013 in particular, the third quarter, we expected some modest dilution. And then, that in the fourth quarter, we expected some modest level of accretion. So, we certainly maintain that belief as we head into the fourth quarter.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay. And as a follow-up, it looks like adjusted operating expenses outpaced gross profit dollar growth for the first time, I think, in about six quarters by about 100 basis points. And I know you've already gotten some questions about this and you called out seasonality with Brakes in response to one of the earlier questions. But the fact is, Brakes was accretive, so can you give any clarification on what's driving the higher", "relative expense growth to gross profit, and if this is some kind of inflection point?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I'd just \u2013 again, as I mentioned earlier, there's nothing there that I would call out as something that I would consider any type of inflection point or change point there. Again, I would just tell you that, in general, in a quarter, our smallest, their smallest, it tends to be a little less leverage on cost than there are in some of the other quarters. Again, our core business actually had very strong leverage between gross profit dollar growth and expenses. I don't anticipate \u2013 again, there's really nothing to call out there, honestly, in terms of that (57:43) business outside of this.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, just keep in mind, I think everyone knows this because you're probably ahead of me on your modeling, but Brakes is a higher gross profit, higher expense business. So, when you get into a quarter where you have this seasonality, which is even more pronounced than our seasonality, that's going to accentuate that even more. But that's really why we break it out the way we do. We're actually quite pleased with how we manage the expenses from the core business, if you will, to Brakes to the corporate office. So, I would say right now, we're feeling good about the expenses. We need to keep growing the gross profit, keep that spread, to Joel's point. But that is totally consistent with what we talk about. We talk about discipline. We talk about that and the customer mix, and we talk about profitable. In this business, what we mean with profitable is to keep that spread there. So, overall, we feel fine on the expenses.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Hey, if I could ask one final question. I just wanted to clarify a comment from your prepared remarks. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought you mentioned that accelerated depreciation for SAP would continue through Q4. So, does that mean the add-back for depreciation ends in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, or do you continue to benefit from technology restructuring next year, and by that, I mean incrementally benefit next year?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Well, so, again, I think the comment there was around the fact that we actually have, as we talked about during the announcement of our revised technology strategy, that because of that and because we're moving away from the SAP platform, that there would be actually accelerated depreciation that we would reflect up until the end of our fiscal 2017. And then, at that point is when we are actually completed with that transition which we are certainly on track to do. And so, the accelerated depreciation that you're seeing in our numbers will end, if you will, at the end of fiscal 2017. And then, there would be some level of benefit we would see from that although, again, I think, as we've talked about that as well, there're some opportunity to reinvest in additional technologies, particularly around customer facing. But to answer your question directly, the accelerated depreciation that you're seeing ends at the end of this year, and you will not be seeing that starting fiscal 2018.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "And it's all embedded in the three-year plan targets.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Correct.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Just another question on gross profit per case. And looking at the gap between inflation, assuming moderate deflation by 1% or something like that, it looks like the gap between gross profit per case and the rate per case growth came in pretty sharply this quarter, still positive but smaller than it's been, which you wouldn't necessarily expect given the sort of favorable mix shifts in the business. I don't know if there is anything you can do to help us decompose how much of that would be related to just the multi-unit piece of the business, or just help us understand why that sort of trend changed. Thanks.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "This is Tom. You might have to help a little bit with \u2013 so, you talk about gross profit per case which we don't really talk about. Are you talking about gross margin and the slowing of the gross margin percent improvement?", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Well, you can look at gross profit growth and gross profit growth versus case growth, and get an idea of what gross profit per case growth looks like. And the gap between that has been running 500 basis points or so ahead of \u2013 in the U.S. Broadline business. 500 basis points or so ahead of inflation or deflation the last couple of quarters. And then, this quarter (01:01:23) like 200 basis points. So, a pretty sharp compression. If you can help us understand what could be driving that.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "I don't really see anything unique or different from what we've been talking about. I think it's obviously the mix of our business continues to drive some of the change. That's certainly, as we talked about, on the gross margin percentage also lapping. We're year-over-year now lapping growth rate upon growth rate from a gross margin percentage perspective. But I guess the last thing I'd say is we feel very good about our 4% gross profit growth in the U.S., and I think relative to the overall case growth that we're seeing, which was slightly below 2% for that same gross profit growth. So, I think we feel very good about where we're at. Joel, if you have anything to add (01:02:13).", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, Karen, I think \u2013 this is Joel. I mean, the main thing I would continue to focus on here is around the \u2013 again, as we talked about, the growth in gross profit dollars and that growth relative to our operating expense dollars. And so, the reason we keep talking about that is at the end of the day, whether it's inflation, deflation, et cetera, that gap certainly drives the efficiency in operating margin. And that's certainly, again, something we're very pleased with. And so, I would just continue to remain focused on those things that really ultimately drive the operating profitability.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you. The question was on the market share that you're taking relative to the broad foodservice distribution industry. Is it happening in some of the smaller independents finally where they're just having a difficult time keeping up with merchandising and technology, and maybe, for lack of a better word, poor sellers of their business to you? And then, secondly, and I think related, and about an hour ago, Tom, you talked about improved e-commerce capabilities for your independent restaurants. And just hoping to get an update on that, and whether you're seeing gradual improvement or maybe something more of step function in terms of how things are changing on that front. Thanks.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Sure. So, I'd say, just back on the market share. So, we obviously are very focused on continuing to grow our share across the business. I think, as you know, there are lots of competitors out there. So, to isolate in one area or another is really hard to do, given we compete with so many different types of folks, literally market by market. So, I would just say that we continue to be focused on delivering the right value proposition for those customers, which includes all the things that I've been talking about. So, I won't reiterate all of those.", "One, in particular, that you did ask about was where we're at on the technology rollout, and we continue to feel really positive about that. We're now seeing across our local customers around 25% of those customers ordering via our online applications. So, we feel really good about the progress we're making, and we continue to feel like that's going to be an area that we'll continue to see growth. But we also \u2013 I want to remind everyone that our approach and our strategy around this is to do this in a way that supports whatever our customers are looking for, meaning giving them choice. Whether that's through online or that's through the marketing associate or through some other way of ordering with us. But we feel great about the progress we continue to make and think it's a combination of all those things that are helping us continue to gain momentum.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Steve Gojak with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.", "Steven Ivan Gojak - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you. Just two quick questions. Just on the corporate management case growth, what was that this quarter, and any impact from customer exits or wins there versus, I believe, the minus 2% last quarter? And then, secondly, just your thoughts on the competitive environment in the third quarter versus the last several quarters. Any change there in it being more or less aggressive. And then, within that, following up to a prior question, as you move from an inflationary environment to a deflationary environment, those competitive pressures, and then the cost and demand pressures on the restaurant operators themselves impact the ability to pass through any sort of price increase or inflation, again, even though you're seeing modest inflation right now? Thank you.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "I guess, let me start with \u2013 we don't communicate the actual numbers on our corporately managed growth. But you know roughly from our prior conversations, we're around 50/50 on our local versus CMU business. And so, we talked about our local and U.S. Broadline being up 3.5%, and our total of 1.8%. So, you can surmise from there. I missed kind of the second part of that, I think it had to do with the inflation-deflation...", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Kind of environment, how would that be accentuated by inflation?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "So, I don't think \u2013 I mean, we've talked about, it remains highly competitive out there. I don't think that the inflation or deflationary environment necessarily affects or changes that competitive nature and who we're competing with. We all deal with some of those impacts as an industry. And obviously, all of us have our way of dealing with those.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, look, Steve, I think that's probably the best answer we have here. Our focus always starts with the customer. So, as their challenges become greater, certainly they probably put more pressure on their suppliers. But we also think that's an opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves relative to many of our competitors, if not all, in terms of what our offerings are across products and services and just basic relationship management that we've done for years.", "Steven Ivan Gojak - Cleveland Research Co.

Earlier this morning Sysco reported strong fourth quarter and excellent fiscal year-end financial results. For the quarter on a comparable 13 week basis, we delivered sales growth of 14% to $14.4 billion, adjusted operating income growth of 14% to $667 million and adjusted earnings per share growth 20% to $0.72.", "For fiscal year 2017 on a comparable 52 week basis sales grew 12% to $55.4 billion, adjusted operating income grew 20% to $2.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share also grew 20% to $2.48. These results were driven by our 65,000 associates providing our customers with the products, services and business solutions they need to run their businesses successfully.", "I'm especially pleased with our local case growth performance in the United States, our overall gross profit growth while expanding gross margin the right way and our focused expense management throughout the Company.", "In addition our European acquisition of the Brakes Group at the beginning of the fiscal year contributed meaningfully to our sales and earnings growth. Our results for the quarter and the year were achieved in a modestly growing U.S. economy, disparate regional economic conditions in Canada and mixed economic backdrops in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Sweden.", "While we continue to transition some large contract customers in our U.S. foodservice operations. Our case growth with local customers in that business segment improved during the second half of our fiscal year. Favorable consumer confidence throughout much of the country contributed to restaurant check size increases, even though year-over-year traffic trends were unfavorable in certain customer segments.", "Taking a moment to reflect on our steadily improving and strong business performance over the past few years, there is no doubt that our customer-centric strategy with a one Sysco approach has been executed at a high level and that we are well positioned to deliver disciplined, profitable and sustainable growth moving forward.", "We aspire to be the most valued and trusted business partner for all of our customers and are committed to delivering on our targeted financial objectives for Sysco\u2019s shareholders. We will continue to develop new and refined current key strategic initiatives such as category management, revenue management, enhanced customer facing technology and multiple productivity improvement measures in order to further differentiate our industry leading customer offerings.", "We will do this by deepening our customer insight work, continually enhancing our technology capabilities and by attracting and developing highly capable and increasing diverse leaders and associates.", "In closing, I would like to thank all of our associates for contributing to our success this past year and for driving our strong performance through the first two years of our 2016 to 2018 three-year plan. I'm confident that we will achieve the high-end or a $600 million to $650 million adjusted operating growth goal, which excludes the impact of Brakes.", "Further we look forward to presenting our new 2018 to 2020 three-year plan later this calendar year. In the spirit of looking forward and positioning Sysco well for future success, we recently announced that Tom Ben\u00e9 will become President and Chief Executive Officer of Sysco effective January 1, 2018.", "Tom is a strong accomplished leader and most deserving successor. I look forward to working closely with Tom together with our senior leadership team over the next few months to ensure smooth transition process.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Thank you Bill, and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2017 was a successful year for Sysco and I'm proud of the results our associates have accomplished this year. They are executing at a high level as we continue to achieve the key strategies levers of our current three-year plan, including delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers, growing gross profit dollars and managing overall expenses.", "Fiscal 2017 was marked not only by our strong performance in which we continued our relentless focus on the customer, but also because of the some important highlights that include the addition of the Brakes business in Europe, a completion of the successful transition of 12 operating companies from SAP through enhanced version of our legacy ERP system, and validation of our customer-centric approach to our business as reinforced by the improvement in our customer loyalty scores.", "An example is our approach to giving customers a choice in how they want to interact with us, whether it\u2019s through our best-in-class sales force, via our mobile platform or through a phone call.", "I would now like to discuss our segment results starting with U.S. Foodservice Operations including some highlights of key strategic initiatives that are helping to differentiate Sysco in the marketplace. In addition, I will speak to the performance of our International Foodservice Operations.", "Our U.S. Foodservice segment had a solid year with fiscal 2017 results on a comparable 52 week basis of sales growth of 1.5% and gross profit growth of 4%, while adjusted operating expenses grew 1.7% resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 7.8%.", "We once again experienced strong growth in our local business, up 2.4% in U.S. Broadline. This was partially offset by declines in case volume for our multi-unit business due to our efforts to deliver disciplined profitable growth. This resulted in approximately 1% total case growth overall.", "As we progress through the next year, we expect to see those trends around our multi-unit business begin to improve. Importantly, as we strive to provide value for our local customers through innovative product offerings and value-added services, along with e-commerce capabilities, we are seeing them reward us with growth for the 13th quarter in a row.", "Looking at gross profit growth for U.S. Foodservice Operations, on a comparable 52 week basis, we delivered growth of 4% and gross margin expansion of 48 basis points, as we manage the deflationary environment in the first part of the year very well and are now working our way through an inflationary environment.", "Poultry, produce, seafood and dairy are driving the current inflation and we expect inflation to continue for the balance of the calendar year. Our strategic focus on accelerating growth of local customers is working. It all starts with an insight-based customer-centric approach that permeates everything we do.", "For example, we have improved the capabilities of our sales force through investments made in training, technology and targeted specialized resources and as a result our marketing associates are spending more time working with our customers on value-added activities and consultative services such as menu analysis, inventory management and business reviews.", "These services foster a deeper relationship with our customers and further enforces the importance of sales force play in helping our customers succeed. From a cost perspective, within U.S. Foodservice Operations our expense management was solid as we limited growth to 1.7% on an adjusted 52 week comparable basis for the year.", "Looking at U.S. Broadline, cost-per-case for fiscal 2017 improved by approximately $0.01 compared to the prior year. And on a fuel price neutral basis, cost-per-case increased by one penny. The consistent performance we have been to achieve is driven by key strategic initiatives which are supported by the expansive network of dedicated hard working front line associates in the warehouse and those team members delivering our products; through their efforts we have consistently been able to deliver a high level of service to our customers.", "Looking at the overall performance for the U.S. foodservice operations on a 52 week comparable basis, I'm pleased with how all of our associates executed our plan; as our adjusted operating income performed well and we were able to improve adjusted operating margins by 45 basis points for the full-year.", "Moving to international foodservice operations; on a 52 week comparable basis sales and adjusted operating income nearly doubled both largely driven by our recent acquisition of the Brakes Group.", "During the year Brakes performed reasonably well in midst of challenging environment in the UK as they exceed our expectation for EPS accretion contributing $0.14 per share. They are also making good progress in their supply chain transformational efforts as they move to multi-temp capability across the UK.", "Growth in France remains steady and Sweden continues to produce favorable results. We also continue to see long-term opportunities for growth across our new European business. Additionally we are in the process of integrating our Ireland businesses and things are progressing well; we expect to achieve modest benefits from these activities.", "Looking forward, we are excited about the long-term opportunities to create value for our customers in the European business. Over the next few years we will invest capital and resources to build on the existing foundation of the business as we continue to work on key strategic initiatives that will position us well for the future.", "We remain pleased with our performance in Canada despite the continued softness in Alberta which has been driven primarily by the energy market decline. Our Canadian business has seen positive momentum in the growth of its local business driven by improved sales execution and implementation of our customer focused initiatives such as category management and revenue management.", "In addition we are effectively managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity. As a result, we expect the Canadian business to continue to deliver positive performance.", "Turning to Latin America we are excited about the new facilities in both Costa Rica and Panama. Specifically in Costa Rica, we recently opened a 180,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility with the test kitchen and training facilities. This new space is enabling new products and full product lines to be available to our customers and we are excited about the accelerated growth potential those offerings will deliver.", "As we enter the new fiscal year, we do so with strong momentum and I believe fiscal 2018 will bring opportunities for Sysco. Our ongoing focus on customer insights and delivering against their needs for innovative products and consultative services will enable our sales force to continue to add significant value and deliver growth with those local customers.", "We will need to effectively manage the ongoing transition to an inflationary environment with our customers while staying focused on gross profit growth and we will continue to focus on driving efficiency from our supply chain through our expansive network that is built to provide a high level of service to our customers.", "In summary, fiscal 2017 showed important progress against our customer-centric strategy for Sysco. Our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around improving our customers' experience, engaging our associates at the highest level to improve execution and delivering on our financial objectives.", "Finally, as I work through the leadership transition with Bill, I'm personally honored to be given the opportunity to lead this amazing Company and I'm incredibly excited about the future for Sysco.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade for further details.", "Joel Grade", "Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and for the year. Our quality of earnings growth for the year reflects continued momentum from our business including strong case growth, excellent gross profit dollar growth and solid cost management.", "This morning, I will set with our quarterly results on the comparable week 13 basis excluding Brakes, where we delivered sales growth of 3.4%, gross profit growth of 4.2% which included margin expansion of 14 basis points and adjusted operating expenses growth of 2.6% resulting in adjusted operating income growth of 9%.", "As Tom mentioned earlier, we saw inflation of approximately 2.6% in our U.S. Broadline business for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The pace of the transition from deflation to inflation has inferably rapid, as produced, poultry, seafood and dairy were increasing and driving overall inflation.", "We do not see negative impacts on our ability to grow gross profit dollars. However, it is important to note that this change from deflation to inflation pressures gross margin as a percentage of sales.", "Shifting gears, I would like to transition to our results for the year on a comparable 52 weeks basis excluding Brakes. Sales grew 1.6% and gross profit dollars grew 4.1% which included margin expansion of 43 basis points and adjusted operating expenses grew 1.7% which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 12.4% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13.6%.", "We continue to maintain a healthy gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth, which translated into an strong adjusted operating income leverage and continue to progress towards achieving our three-year plan objectives.", "Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion for the year, up approximately $309 million from last year. Free cash flow for the year $1.6 billion, which is about $150 million higher compared to last year.", "These changes are largely due to improved business performance, improve working capital management and favorable year-over-year comparisons due to the U.S. Foods termination payment last year offset by higher fiscal 2017 cash taxes due to prior year deductions related to the U.S. Foods payment and a deferral from flood relief.", "Net CapEx for the year was $663 million or about 1.2% of sales, which is $159 million higher than last year primarily due to ongoing capital investments and the addition of Brakes. Net working capital performance has continued to improve.", "We have nearly achieve our three-year goal of four days and have improved our net DSO by 3.8 days compared to FY 2015 driven improvements in all three areas, payables, receivables and inventory.", "Our fiscal 2017 results include certain items that were related to the Brakes acquisition including amortization associated with the transaction and accelerated depreciation related to our enhance business technology strategy. The accelerated depreciation related to technology has concluded and will not be part of our fiscal 2018.", "Lastly I\u2019m pleased with our adjusted return on invested capital performance which ended the year approximately 13%. Excluding Brakes our ROIC was approximately 16% which exceeded our original three-year plan objective of 15%.", "Now I would like to close with some commentary and the outlook for fiscal year 2018. After two years, we have been able to achieve $417 million of operating income growth since fiscal 2015 and I share Bill's confidence that we will achieve the high-end of our $600 million to $650 million adjusted operating income growth goal which excludes the impact of Brakes.", "As such, we anticipate another solid year in fiscal 2018 driven by gradually improving results throughout the year. The return to an inflationary environment will likely continue for the balance of the calendar year creating a gross margin headwind as a percentage of sales, but it should not hamper our ability to grow our gross profit dollars.", "As we have previously stated, our capital allocation priorities include key focus on investing in our business. Capital expenditures will increase during fiscal 2018 and are expected to be approximately 1.3 to 1.4% of sales including Brakes.", "The increase compared to our recent run rate is driven by a few factors, including increased investments and facility expansions and improvements and increased technology investments. To accelerate the success we are having with customer facing technology and increased investments in technologies to support our shared services organization.", "Even with the increase in capital spend we still expect continued strong cash flow performance for fiscal year 2018. As such, we expect to continue to grow our dividend in fiscal 2018 and finally we have completed our $3 billion two year share repurchase program during fiscal 2017. Our share buybacks in 2018 were in line with our capital allocation strategy and involve opportunistic purchases and buybacks that offset dilution.", "In summary, we had a strong year, reflecting continued momentum from our business driven by strong local case growth, excellent gross profit dollar growth and good cost management. We achieved a healthy spread between gross profit growth and expense growth that has led to strong leverage for our earnings. We also have been able to effectively turn those earnings into cash and grow our free cash flows.", "These results are just the ongoing commitment of our associates to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business. We remain committed to those high levels of service and executions translating into enhanced financial performance in both the near and long-term.", "Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital, your line is open.", "Kelly Bania", "Hi, good morning, just wanted to go back to the comment about the operating income targets and the confidence in reaching the high-end I guess implies an acceleration, you mentioned kind of some gradually improving results in terms of expectations for next year. So I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that where that is. It sound like may be some of the multi-unit trends may be could improve next year or just could you walk us through the thought process there?", "Joel Grade", "Sure, absolutely. This is Joel. So yes. Number one, I think the key point as I have talked about is, we certainly as Bill and I both said, are constant in our ability at the high-end of that target. And I would say that the acceleration that I talked through the year really is partially related to some of the improved multi-unit volume throughout the year.", "In addition to that, in terms of timing, there are some elements of incorporating the Brakes business into our business that will result in some level of increasing transition between the first half and the second half of the year. And so, again that I think as we have kind of talked about here, I wouldn\u2019t look for anything dramatic there, but just a gradual acceleration I think over the course of the year is what we are really talking about.", "Kelly Bania", "Great. And then just to ask also about the independents, the growth with independents again was strong. Just curious if in your discussions with them if you are sensing any change in their confidence or any change in how their outlook over the next couple of years?", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Hey, Kelly. Good morning, it\u2019s Tom. I think we continue to feel that the independent segment is well positioned to continue to perform at a decent level. Obviously as we talked, there is been some I would say some softness in restaurants in general, but I think we still feel like the independents are well positioned whether it\u2019s the product offering that they have, their ability to be flexible to meet the changing consumer needs.", "I think the other thing just as always a reminder is because of our - whether it\u2019s our current share of the market or the fragmentation that exists generally in foodservice, we continue to believe that there is lots of opportunity for us to grow and whether that\u2019s in independent restaurant segment or other segments of our business.", "Kelly Bania", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.", "John Heinbockel", "So, Tom, I\u2019m curious, if you look out the next year or two, what is the prognosis on accelerated growth in some of the centers of plate categories, seafood meals or produce, given that you have made some changes organizationally, is that maybe we see an acceleration in part of the business or is that going to take a little while longer?", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Good morning, John. What I think specifically to those areas we are fortunate at Sysco, we have got an organization and a business structure that is exists around specialty meat and produce that positions us well. And so, I think we continue to believe that center of the plate is an important category and I think we look at that and say whether it\u2019s the way we have structured ourselves now or the fact that we have got those capabilities that we are well positioned to grow.", "And so, whether or not that\u2019s going to be a significant acceleration or not probably has much to do with what is going on broadly in the marketplace, but I think we feel like we are well positioned and we continue to work on improving even our current position in those areas.", "John Heinbockel", "Okay. And then something completely differently, if you think about the international business again framing first, relative to the U.S., I know the goal has been right U.S. to grow GP 100 basis points above SG&A. Is that something that you can duplicate internationally or given where Brakes is can the spread be wider for some period of time?", "William DeLaney", "Well first of all John its Bill, good morning and I'm not sure that we have spoke into a 100 basis points [gaps] (Ph) going forward, but we certainly have talked a lot about that we are pleased with the way we are growing the GP relative to the expenses and we certainly do need to continue grow that faster.", "I think when you look at internationally, we will continue to report that segment and you have got a mix of things going on there; certainly a mature business in Canada where as Tom just said in U.S., we still see a lot of opportunity for growth up there and to leverage some of these strategic initiatives that we have rolled out for the most part in the United States to do that over in Canada, and we are swiftly here moving forward.", "Brakes itself, you heard Joel kind of alluded to it, we have owned it now for about a year, we are really pleased with that acquisition, there's a lot of upside potential, we are in a normal part of a transition process now where we are going to be continuing to invest in some of the transformation work that they had already started to make their warehouses more efficient to put to a big merger that they did in France together and to continue with our integration work in Ireland.", "So I think Europe is a little harder to call on it, but you know certainly growing the bottom line the right way both in terms of top-line as well as leveraging the GPs is that mantra will continue there just as it will in the U.S.; and then in Latin America, smaller markets to be sure and we are really building for the future there with some of the countries that we are in, with the management team as we are partnering with them there. And as Tom mentioned we have got a new facility or two coming along.", "So I would look at international as a little bit more variable relative to the U.S. side, but certainly our overall levers that we talked about here over the medium to long-term which is to grow volume and to leverage that volume and to get a good return on invested capital, those will continue throughout the Company.", "John Heinbockel", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Kirk from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "William Kirk", "Hey guys, thank you for taking the question. I wanted to go back towards the inflation in food, it looks like restaurants their pass through or their pricing hasn't been as strong in the last couple of months as it had been over the last call it two years and that's happening at the same time their food product inflation has now arrived. So that sounds to me like something that's hard for the vertical to manage. Can you help me understand if that dynamics is important and maybe what tier of the vertical it would impact the most?", "William DeLaney", "Yes I will start Bill, its Bill here. I'm not as familiar with some of that data that you're just referencing, and I would just tell you generally what we have seen over the years and we have talked a lot of about this on calls like this. When you have an inflationary period and where that overall inflation is in the 2% to 3% area, it's usually at a level just for the customer in a particular restaurant were able to pass along.", "So generally a 2% rate is a kind of sweet spot for our customers and not a huge challenge for us; now we did point here earlier that the transition from deflation to inflation has been a little more rapid than normal, and there are certainly some categories where we are seeing more than 2% to 3% inflation. So that becomes a challenge both in terms of how we work with our customers and they work with their patrons, but I wouldn't say we are seeing anything out there today that would be overly difficult for our customers to pass along.", "William Kirk", "Okay, and related to that during this transitional period gross margin percentage comes under a little pressure. Would there be any way to discern - is increased competition is part of that or if that\u2019s just a natural pressure during the inflection?", "Joel Grade", "Yes. let me just address that, it\u2019s Joel. I think the main reason really calling that out is really more of what I will call a mathematical function of the inflationary pricing and so I think even in the previously deflationary periods we have talked about that that there was an element of that that was driving a margin as a percentage.", "So I think the main thing for you to take away and just have to remember, our key focus is on gross profit dollars and so while again there maybe some mathematical pressure on the margin percentage, at the end of the day we feel good about our ability to generate gross profit dollars which is ultimately the focus that we will continue to go after.", "William DeLaney", "And look, I think that\u2019s a really key point, we continue to make it - we are going to be going through and we are in the midst of going through transition now in this environment and our revenue management tools, this will be the first time that we have really utilized those in an inflation environment.", "So, that\u2019s an opportunity to continue to manage the price movements more effectively than perhaps we had in the past, but if I really want to emphasize, our ability to grow the gross profit dollars to 4% in a deflationary environment that approach deflation of 2% over most of the fiscal year. It\u2019s really an extraordinary achievement and its one that in my judgment we would have not been able to produce those numbers if we didn\u2019t have the tools available to us that we do today in terms of [CapMan] (Ph) and [RevMan] (Ph) a lot of the sales concentrated work that Tom was speaking to.", "So, obviously our job is to manage and to work closely with our customers through these dynamic periods, but we are much better positioned today to work through this, but the key here really is gross profit dollars that is what we pay our bills with and that\u2019s what drives the earnings growth that John Heinbockel was referencing earlier.", "William Kirk", "Okay. Thank you for that that context. That was useful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Marisa Sullivan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Marisa Sullivan", "Question. Wanted to touch on Brakes and to get your thoughts on accretion that you are expecting for next year and where you see opportunities both on top-line and then also in productivity?", "William DeLaney", "Yes. So, I will start with the accretion number. I think as we have talked about when we originally had announced the deal, we have anticipated in the first year, a mid single-digit accretion and the second year, I think in the low double-digits of accretion. We certainly believe that continue to be the case. So, I think I would look at that as probably roughly similar to the current year as far as that goes. Tom, I don\u2019t know, if you want to talk about the top-line.", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Yes. And then regarding just generally how we are feeling about it, as I mentioned the UK market certainly had some choppiness in it, but I think we are feeling good about where we can be positioned there. We had good movement in growth in France and we feel good about our business in Sweden and obviously with what we are doing in Ireland we continue to feel pretty good about that as well.", "So, I think overall we feel like we remain pretty well positioned and I think we are just obviously going to have to keep an eye on what is going on from a market perspective, but I think we are positioned how we are performing we feel pretty good. We do have some investments we need to make over the next year there and we feel like that\u2019s an important part of us continuing to build on the work they had started pre-acquisition and we shared and talked a little bit about that earlier.", "Marisa Sullivan", "Got it and just to change topics, want to touch on the Sigma business. Can you comment on the sales growth trends excluding 53rd week question and also was curious to see the gross margin up a little bit year-over-year, wonder if you could give some more context on that.", "William DeLaney", "Sure, I mean related to Sigma, we had good top-line growth from Sigma perspective. We had some new customers that have come on board in that business over the last year and so I think that's driving some of that top-line, obviously very competitive out there still in this space and we continue to work through that part of it. From a margin standpoint again I think that has much to do with some of the - think about how that business has managed on a cost plus basis, there's some margin impact of that, but it's mostly driven by new business that is driving the improvements there.", "Marisa Sullivan", "Got it, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Shane Higgins from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Shane Higgins", "Thanks, good morning guys. Just wanted to get a sense of how local case or both U.S. Broadline and local case has kind of trended during the fourth quarter and what you guys are seeing in terms of trends, any color you can give 1Q to-date?", "William DeLaney", "Hey Shane how are you. Well as we said, we had solid, what was it Joel? 2.4 for the year and 2.7 for the quarter coming off of the third quarter we were over three on the local side, so we were pleased with that. You know as I mentioned and Tom alluded to I think as well, we have been transitioning some large contract customer business, some of it our own choice, some of it not, we are in the midst of continuing to do that but we are in a good place there and we expect those trends to gradually improve as we talked earlier you know later in the year. So overall cases flat to one, but local cases 2.5 to 3.", "Joel Grade", "I would just remind you too, I mean it\u2019s part of our - again this is now the 13th quarter in a row we have grown our local cases and in addition to that if you think about the range that we said at the time when we thought about this original three-year plan, I think that you know this range is 2.5%-ish was right close to where we are at and so I think we feel good overall above that.", "Shane Higgins", "Great and just a follow-up on the gross profit dollars and impact of the transition to inflation. Did that actually benefit that 4% type number that you guys put up for the quarter, the return to inflation and how should we think about that impacting your gross profit dollar growth in the first quarter.", "Joel Grade", "Yes, so I think the way I would think about that for this quarter, I think certainly again we are pleased with the 4% plus growth. I think the transition as I mentioned and Bill mentioned as well was fairly quick and so while we don't have a real significant lag in terms of turning over pricing there is some lag and so what I would just say in general is that in fairly rough and rapid uptick in a few categories that I would say again slow to little bit the acceleration of the gross profit growth. So that's how I would think about that in terms of how it impacted this quarter.", "But again, as we talked about going forward, we certainly are confident in our ability to grow our gross profit dollars despite that inflation as Bill talked about. The overall inflation number is well within the range of modern inflation that we think works in this industry well and so feel good in general, but to answer your question directly there wasn't I'd say a major impact in this quarter on that.", "Shane Higgins", "Great. Thanks, I will get back in the queue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Karen Short", "Hi, thanks. Joel just to clarify one thing in terms of the Brakes accretion, mid single-digit year one, I think you said low double-digit year two, is that pennies or percent?", "Joel Grade", "Pennies.", "Karen Short", "Okay. And then I guess I was curious on a couple of things. One of your competitors last week commented on Technomics outlook for independent restaurants. And it just seemed very counter intuitive, I mean when you talk to any restaurant analysts that independents are actually slowing. So wondering if you could give some color on that and I just had one other housekeeping question.", "William DeLaney", "Yes, I will take a shot of that Karen. Technomics you know there is a lot of different sources as you know in the industry that we all rely on to get as much data as we can, and a lot of the data crosses over between custom segments and is somewhat defined differently by different people.", "Technomics has been kind of that consistent barometers, it\u2019s been out there for years and they do a good job. But the reality is while their data comes from people in our industry that they interview and talk to and so I would characterize it as directional and I would tell you six or nine months ago people were saying that the independent was going to grow a lot faster and be in the upper 2% and I don\u2019t know if that totally bought into that. And now we are seeing that their forward view in the medium term, even short-term is lower than 2%.", "So from our perspective I think it\u2019s good information, it\u2019s consistently done. You have got an economy out that\u2019s growing at about 2%. And I think in industry there is no big shocks in this industry right now, so there is nothing going on anywhere close to similar to what we saw in 2009.", "So what I\u2019m trying to say is that I think there is no big secular trends going on, there is some cyclical things, there is always weather, there is comparisons. But I think I 1.5% to 2.5% range out there at different points of time is where we have historically have been and that is certainly how we are looking at it in terms how we work through our strategy and how we plan the business.", "So I wouldn\u2019t get too excited about it being where it was six months ago and I wouldn\u2019t be too excited about the most recent forecast. And the key is growth here and the business is still growing and it\u2019s growing - those check sizes are growing and we are well positioned to take advantage of that growth and Tom pointed out.", "Karen Short", "Okay, thanks. And then I just was curious, I know you don\u2019t want to be pinned down to a spread between gross profit dollar growth versus OpEx growth, but as we look kind of to the next three-years, once we get into 2018, just may be qualitatively could you give us a sense of where you think operating profit growth will come from more, is it more on the OpEx opportunity side or do you think it\u2019s still fairly down the same gross profit, or gross margin, gross profit opportunities in OpEx?", "Joel Grade", "Yes, I think the way I would think about that Karen first of all, as we talked about, we will certainly give more guidance on our next three-year plan later this calendar year. But I would look at this as a very balanced approach to growth, which certainly we have talked about our three-year plan and I would certainly think about as we move forward.", "Again I think both from the focus on local customers, growing local cases and overall profitable cases, focus on growing our gross profit dollars and again being very effectively, aggressively and thoughtfully managing our costs is really a very balanced you know is how I would really think about this moving forward.", "Karen Short", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ajay Jain from Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.", "Ajay Jain", "Yes, hi good morning. Joel I think you mentioned that you're at $417 million in operating income growth towards that three-year target. So I wanted to first confirm that number and I was also wondering if you can confirm how much incremental growth you had in the latest quarter. Correct me if I'm wrong, I thought you are already close to around $410 million at the end of Q3, so that might imply not much incremental growth in the fourth quarter?", "Joel Grade", "So, first of all $417 million Ajay is the number, now keep in mind when you're looking at comparatives you're looking at a quarter of last year that had the additional week versus this year. So the incremental growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis purely is not something you're going to be able to look at just directly. So the incremental growth - Neil if you want to take that during the quarter?", "Neil Russell", "Yes sure Ajay you're right. If you're looking at 13 week versus 14 week it's relatively modest, but if you look at 13 weeks versus 13 week comparable the rate of operating income growth is pretty much in line with what you're seeing throughout the year.", "Ajay Jain", "Okay. I was asking about the sequential increase from Q3 and Q4?", "Joel Grade", "We had $52 million ex-Brakes, so if you're comparing to the $417 million again is part of the three-year plan; so $52 million on a comparable quarterly basis what we added in the fourth quarter this year when you factor 13-13.", "Ajay Jain", "And I just had a question about the U.S. case growth, can you talk about the sequential decrease, typically total case growth should be higher compared to case growth in the street business and that wasn't the case in Q4. I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that they always had transitioning of the less profitable business about 1%, but if you adjust for the calendar shift and the transitional impact for those multi-unit accounts, what was the case growth for the non local portion of the U.S. Broadline, can you quantify that or at least confirm its positive or negative?", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Yes. So, a couple of things, as we talked, we had consistent improvement in the local growth over the last 13 quarters quite honestly, but we talked about the 2.7% in the fourth quarter for local; the contract business or the CNU we talked about it was in fact negative for the quarter and that's consistent with what we have talked about as we have looked at our portfolio and as Bill mentioned earlier we had certain customers we made some decisions on and there are customers who had made some decisions around doing business with us.", "But we continue to feel really good about the overall number that 1% comes from a combination of the contract business declining and the local business continuing to be strong; and my comment about improving is we do see some lapping of that happening in fiscal year 2018 and we also have some new business, will be coming on later in the year.", "Ajay Jain", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Christopher Mandeville", "Hey good morning. The majority of my questions have already been asked, but I guess I was hoping you could touch on wage pressures and the availability of qualified labor, has that worsened at all over the last 12 months or what kind of level of growth can we expect as we look to 2018?", "William DeLaney", "Chris I will start and I will let Tom and Joel jump in here too. I think there's two things going on as it relates to labor, certainly with our customers in certain parts of the country there continues to be some pressure to source employees as well as labor wages and rates to pay and of all that. So, that continues to be phenomena out there that we are working closely with our customers on.", "And on our end of it, when you hear us talk about flat cost per apiece in the most simplicity way what that really is about especially on the supply chain and the operation side of the business is to be keep our wage and benefit increases in line with our productivity increases and productivity obviously comes in a different way. But it\u2019s largely productivity in the warehouse on the truck how we manage overtime all those types of things.", "And so, we are pleased with where we are there right now. I would say most of our contracts and most of our annual increases are in line with that productivity goals that we have set, but it something we have to manage very aggressively and very hard, but over the last few years we have done a nice job of it.", "Joel Grade", "Yes and I think as Bill covered the financial part of that, from a retention standpoint, we measure employee retention and we feel good about where we are today and where we have been as it relates to lot of those types of roles. So, I think the marketplace is I guess in a decent place and obviously I think we as a employer doing a nice job of attracting and retaining the people we need.", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "I think the only thing I would just add, just lot of the questions that we get - questions on minimum wage loss and this and that and the other thing and that\u2019s an impact on our customers in terms of the things they are dealing with that doesn\u2019t necessarily or doesn\u2019t really impact us at all and that most of our labors as well double or wage rates.", "Christopher Mandeville", "All right. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess I have got a random one for you. I\u2019m curious as the Brakes business is been affected by the recent [Agra call] (Ph) in Europe and if so can you help us understand how and whether or not that\u2019s incorporated into the new outlook?", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "I don\u2019t know if we can help you with that one today, Chris. So we will come back to you.", "Christopher Mandeville", "All right. Thank you again guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John Ivankoe", "Hi. Two questions if I may. Firstly, the restaurant industry or at least some of the public data that we see show June is kind of one of the softer months of the quarter and that softness continuing from June into July it\u2019s not actually getting a little bit worse. So, just wanted to get a sense in terms of what you are seeing just in terms of the broad industry and independent restaurants specifically?", "William DeLaney", "Hey, John. Look, I think what we see is it moves around, okay. So there is periods where you have a couple of months where it\u2019s spikes up or at least goes up somewhat and then it comes back down and sometimes it\u2019s hard to explain from one quarter even one month or two months stretch to another.", "So, I don\u2019t know that I would get overly excited about one or two months of data, it\u2019s somewhat mixed out there. Consumer confidence is positive for the most part our restaurant operators and customer feel good about the business not quite, maybe is feasibly good as they were a few months ago, but my experience tells me that these numbers move around and they are still very much on a range that as I said earlier it translates to go to the industry and that\u2019s certainly good for us.", "John Ivankoe", "Okay. And then secondly regarding the CapEx, I think the guidance is 1.3% to 1.4% of sales and I do understand for you that that moves around. Maybe a little bit forward looking on that comment, I mean is that\u2019s the new level of CapEx as a percentage of revenue as we think about your capital needs over the next couple of years where might 2018 be kind of a peak or a trough I guess and the level changes in the years after?", "Joel Grade", "Hey John this is Joel. I think you're first comment was probably the right one in that that does move around somewhat. I don\u2019t know that I wouldn't look at that necessarily as the new norm, I think I would characterize it as the fact that we have strong cash flows, we have opportunities to invest as I have talked about in some things to continue to transform the Brakes business as well technology initiatives and some facility opportunities we have. So I would certainly look at that, I would call as much opportunistic and again just really consistent with our priorities of continue to reinvest in this Company and we will benefit if that is long-term rate.", "John Ivankoe", "And is there anything discrete, I think you said a number of things in your prepared comments, but is there anything discrete that we can point to in terms of capital spend on 2018 that will be a material benefit in 2019 or beyond?", "Joel Grade", "No, I wouldn't look at it that way. Again, across the category as I talked about, again our return on invested capital continues to grow, we certainly feel good about the investments we are making but there is nothing I would finger point as one discrete item.", "William DeLaney", "I mean I would say the aggregate John, the incremental part of that will be a benefit in 2019 and probably more beyond 2019 to be fair, these are capital investments we are making.", "John Ivankoe", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Andrew Wolf", "Thank you, just a quick housekeeping to start with and I might have missed this, but did you say how much acquisitions helped sales in the U.S. foodservice segment.", "William DeLaney", "We did not.", "Andrew Wolf", "Did you provided that number so is...", "William DeLaney", "Andy I guess the biggest acquisition - we certainly talked about Brakes, which is clearly been a significant acquisition for us, but in terms of any small fold ins we didn't get it. Its minor I will tell you just in general, it certainly remains a point of focus here for us going forward in terms of our teams and we see opportunities there're different opportunities.", "As we talked earlier, we still see some fold in opportunities in this country and in Canada, both on the Broadline but in particular on the specialty side of the business. Certainly with Brakes we have a platform over there now in the countries that we are in as well as some other countries to grow and invest overtime.", "You know it's a long-term investment and then what I spoke to as it relate to Latin America that's probably although modest in size at this point in time, you know probably will be the most wide open area that we have for acquisition opportunities.", "Andrew Wolf", "Okay, so I mean I'm sort of throwing in a number of somewhere less than 1% for the whole business not just for the U.S...", "Joel Grade", "It's well less than that, again when you take the Brakes number out again for this year that's was with a key focus. Bill talked about certainly a focus for us moving forward.", "Andrew Wolf", "So on the inflation side for the case growth slowed yet the gross profit dollars were the same as last quarter, so clearly there is some pass through or lot. Could you speak to the cadence of that, did it improve or are there any other players out there who might be struggling, looking for share and maybe using price as a lever. Could you just give us a sense of what's going on in the market as you see on price pass through.", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Andy this is Tom, I think the first thing I'd start with is when we talk we talk a lot about this, it remains very competitive out there. We have lots of competitors in general and from a market perspective I think we continue to look at leveraging all of the capabilities we have whether it\u2019s things like the category management we talked about to make sure we have got the best cost on products or its revenue management tool, so we make sure that we are pricing products appropriately in the marketplace and making sure we are taking care of our customers.", "We still feel really good about obviously our ability to grow and our ability to do it in the right way and I think that\u2019s really what you are seeing. I don\u2019t think there is any specific thing that\u2019s happened in addition to that. This is really about a balanced approach, making sure we are focused the right levers of the business that starts with that local customer where we can incremental value and doing the things that help basically get recognized and rewarded by them for providing the right products and the right services in a right way. So I don\u2019t think there is anything beyond that that you should read into it.", "William DeLaney", "No, I don\u2019t think so either, I mean guess I\u2019m going to go back and reiterate a couple of points I made in my prepared comments that as you know the way we look at this business is we are in a sort of long haul here and we have got a very customer-centric strategy that\u2019s predicated and more and better growing customer insights in terms of what they need to run their business better, how do they deal with commodity pressure, how do they deal with price increases, how do they deal with non-traditional competitive forces in the marketplace.", "And so, that customer insight work that we have done over the years we are going to continue to invest in that, deepen it, broaden it, accelerate it where necessary. And that\u2019s what brings us to where we are today and where we have come over the last several years which is a strategy and a platform here that starts with the customers.", "But very much is about differentiating ourselves in the marketplace from all types of competitors, and in particular, utilizing our sales force more efficiently, more productively providing them tool they need to provide consulted service that Tom referenced to our customer base and leveraging our supply chain.", "We have got a footprint globally now today and growing brand and differentiating products and services in a way that provide values to those customers, but also providing that wide range of products fresh, frozen, dry whatever folks are looking for, utilizing the brand in a way that provides value for them, but also where we can source from around the world. And then obviously technology is another area that we continue to hear from our customers. Anything we can do to help them run their businesses more efficiently, we need to do.", "And that\u2019s where you have seen us pivot here over the last couple of years and on the margin, invest more of our spend on the technology side, in the customer facing side, in the things like supplies on fly, cape, Sysco Labs that are trying to stay current at least with the evolving needs of our customer base.", "So clearly it\u2019s a competitive business and clearly a lot of competition, but we feel we are very well positioned here not just for today, but continue to go forward as long as we stay close to our customer base.", "Andrew Wolf", "Thank you. And a similar question just to follow-up. On the multi-unit side, it sounds like you are stacking better trends there with both sales and profitability. And it sounds like some of the other large players at least one of them sounded sort of has the same expectation. Is it kind of tough market for I think the distributors, but sort of lacking price discipline. But it seems like - just want to get your sense, do you think that might be changing somewhat either from your perspective or again from the market perspective?", "William DeLaney", "I think what we have been really consistent on Andy is that we continue to see opportunities for growth, we are about growth, but we look at growth a little differently than we probably did 10 or 15 years ago, it\u2019s about profitable disciplined, sustainable, i.e. repeatable growth and doing it in the right way in the communities that we serve.", "So I don\u2019t know that there is anything really different out there, this is a strategy that we have put together and executed I think increasingly well over the last few years. It\u2019s going to remain competitive out there and we all go after the business hard, but I think everybody understands it we have got shareholders out there that we need to provide returns for as well.", "Andrew Wolf", "Yes, thank you.", "William DeLaney", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Vincent Sinisi", "Hey guys, thanks very much for taking my question here. I wanted to just go back to the comment that you made that - you have made in prior quarters as well of course about some of typically the larger customer exits, some that you decide some maybe not, just trying to get a better sense of kind of the dynamics of the competitive environment like are you able to kind of follow some of those customers like where do they go or if you're getting them from others where do they come from is that more kind of shifting between the three larger players or are there any other dynamics to be aware of?", "Joel Grade", "So, Vini I assume we are back talking about really the contract side of the business here. I guess we have said and I will reiterate is that Bill just said this as well. We are very focused on kind of disciplined profitable growth and wanted to make sure that we are making the right decisions and sometimes those decisions that we make drive a customer to make a different decision; we certainly know when we lose the customer where it goes and we certainly know when we gain a customer where it came from.", "But I wouldn't say there's anything unique or different going on in the marketplace, it's always been competitive, it continues to be competitive and it's really about making sure that we are making the right decisions for Sysco and for our shareholders and that's how we try to approach this business and so aside from that I wouldn't say there's a whole lot else to say.", "William DeLaney", "Yes, and we stick close them Vini. I mean this business what goes around comes around in this business, sometimes in that part of it takes a while, but we certainly maintain a relationship as best we can and we are investing for the long-term so it's not unusual for a customer perhaps to move on and then come back to Sysco at some point in time in the future.", "Vincent Sinisi", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up to the comments on the 2018 CapEx, I know you guys have said in the prepared kind of facilities expansion, tech investment things of that nature, I'm sure we will get more color in the fall, but anything you could tell us today in terms of anything that we should be kind of be expecting with any of those and also maybe a split between the U.S. and in the international sides of the business?", "Joel Grade", "This is Joel. I think as we have talked a little bit before, I mean it's a pretty broad portfolio of investments we are planning to make that we certainly anticipate benefits from in aggregate over the upcoming years.", "Again, it's really focused around just broadly opportunities to reinvest in our facilities, add capabilities and expansions there, technology again really focused to the most part around our customer facing technologies and the customer experience as well as opportunities to enhance our shared services platform to drive further efficiency and then from the standpoint of investing in the continued transformation opportunities in Brakes.", "I think again that would be broadly characterizing the high points of that and so I think you have a little bit of a sense from this year's earnings where the amount of investment that we put into Brakes, we called that out as we talked of our FY 2017 CapEx, it's probably reasonable and fairly consistent here over the next year.", "Vincent Sinisi", "Okay. Great, thanks Joel and Bill, Tom best of luck to you guys over the next few months here preparing for the transition.", "William DeLaney", "Thanks Vini.", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Zachary Fadem", "Hey good morning, thanks for fitting me in. Quickly on the three-year plan, you said you're tracking at the high-end of the six to 650 range, but as you look at the year ahead with a little more clarity on the current operating environment is there still potential to come in above the high-end and if so what are the drivers that need to happen to get there?", "William DeLaney", "Hey Zac. There is always potential, but I think where we are at right now is we are trying to signal that we feel good about the high-end and that\u2019s where we would like to leave that for today, but certainly we are not going to stop at 650 if we don\u2019t have to and that\u2019s really our message for the day.", "We have said now several times that the markets are going to be somewhat fluid here, but overall we now operate in several large markets, we are well positioned if not the leading player in all of those markets and we see plenty of opportunity for growth and we are much more disciplined about how we go after growth today.", "So, if you put all this in some type of historical context that 650 is about $200 million higher than where we started two years ago. So, I\u2019m not ready to go above that today, but we certainly feel good about the number.", "Zachary Fadem", "Fair enough. And is there any directional commentary you could provide on Broadline case growth in the next year, for the national account level should we anticipate further calling here? And then second, should we think about continued share gains for the local customers in 2018?", "Thomas Ben\u00e9", "So on the contract side, as I said earlier, I think you will see us showing some improvement in those numbers as we get into fiscal year 2018, because of the both lapping some of the decision were made last year and also we have some new business that will be coming on. So, I think you should feel like there will be some improvement there.", "Regarding the local business, I mean we continue to feel really good about how we are positioned and as we talked about why we feel like we are able to succeed in that space has really more to do with how we are focused on delivering the value for those customers. I did say in my prepared comments about our loyalty score is going up.", "And I think one of the things as we think about what drove that, we talk to our customers a lot and what we have heard was everything from they are feeling about our marketing associates and continuing to add a lot of value through our selling resources and that means we are accomplishing the things we said, which is making them much more capable on and be more consultative and how they are working with our customers.", "We also heard good things around our technology platform, so I think we feel really good about the types of strides we are making the strategic initiatives we have been talking about. And so I think to us that\u2019s confirmation that the things we are trying to do for these customers is working.", "Zachary Fadem", "Got it. Thanks so much Tom, really appreciate the time guys. Best of luck.", "William DeLaney", "Thanks Zack.", "Joel Grade", "Thanks Zack.", "Operator", "Our last question comes Bob Summers from Macquarie. Your line is open.", "Robert Summers", "Hello. Thanks guys for squeezing me in. I just wanted to a dig a little more into the deflation, inflation dynamic and better understanding and maybe you have something here from the customer insight work that you have done. But, the situation seems unique and that overall product cost have been coming down in aggregate for the last you call it 20 months against that backdrop restaurants have generally been taking pricing. I\u2019m not really sure what that pass through has been to the end operator. But as you think about the resistance to price increases what is the risk, hat there is more margin risk here than you have seen historical in inflection points?", "William DeLaney", "Hey, Bob. I think the risk is that it spikes in some high cost boxes. In another words, - if it were to spike into double-digits as it has in the past with meat or poultry that type of thing. That would move the number overall and those boxes tend to be expensive and that puts a little more pressure on our customer and we have to manage that the right way.", "So, as I said earlier I think the range right now is still in that range that is manageable, but I think the bigger issue is one or two key categories that are high dollar categories may spike. Things like produce and dairy they are going to move around. They move around multiple times within a 12 month period generally.", "So that would be maybe my contingent caveat there that if it were to spike up in meat, poultry, seafood not as big a category obviously that would put more pressure on the customer, but right now it's in the manageable range.", "Robert Summers", "Okay, thanks.", "William DeLaney", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you for joining us today.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin today's call with opening remarks and introductions.", "I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.", "Neil A. Russell - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks, Tiffany. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Joining me in Houston today are Bill DeLaney, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom Ben\u00e9, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause the results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings.

The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found in the Investors section of our website.", "Additionally, due to the Brakes Group acquisition that closed in July 2016, we've previously referenced financial performance results both including and excluding the acquisition for our fiscal 2017. Beginning this quarter and going forward, as we now have a full year's worth of financial results, we will be referencing financial results for Sysco in total. The one exception will be for operating income, as we still plan to give visibility on our original three-year plan target which did not include Brakes.", "Additionally, we have scheduled our Investor Day for December 7 in New York. We look forward to seeing you there.", "To ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bill DeLaney.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our start to fiscal 2018 as reflected in the solid financial \u2013 as reflected in the solid first quarter results Sysco reported earlier this morning. For the quarter, sales increased 5% to $14.7 billion; adjusted operating income increased nearly 6% to $662 million; and adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.74. These results were achieved in the midst of several devastating natural disasters during the latter part of the quarter which adversely impacted our business and that of our customers in several key markets. We estimate that our operating income for the quarter would have been approximately $10 million higher if not for the lost sales and reduced productivity caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Tom and Joel will provide additional perspective on the financial impact of these unprecedented events later on in the call.", "Additionally, I'd like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all of the first responders, volunteers and charitable organizations who worked tirelessly to support those in need. I'd also like to thank our dedicated associates who sacrificed personally to ensure delivery of product to those customers with critical needs such as hospitals and shelters. Further, it has been incredibly gratifying for me to witness the tremendous outpouring of support amongst thousands of our associates for one another through Sysco's Disaster Relief Foundation.", "Moving now to the current economic and market environments in which we operate. We are hopeful that the recently reported and improved GDP trends in the United States could ultimately lead to demand lift for our domestic customer base. While it's difficult to totally isolate the impact of the extreme weather experience in Texas and Florida in September, it appears that current market conditions in the United States for foodservice operators are modestly favorable. Larger check sizes at restaurants continue to offset somewhat lower traffic counts while consumer sentiment remains at relatively high levels.", "Conversely, economic growth in the European markets we operate in is more muted. In addition, significant foreign exchange-driven food cost inflation in our UK business continues to pressure our pricing, which has impacted our volume growth and gross margins. We are highly focused and actively engaged in addressing these challenges in a manner that is beneficial both to our customers and to Sysco.", "Turning to Sysco's current state, we continue to execute our customer-centric strategy at a high level. The fundamentals of our business are strong and we are well-positioned to achieve disciplined, profitable and sustainable growth in the future. I'm confident that we will be able to continue to leverage quality sales growth in our domestic Foodservice business by continually improving the implementation of our commercial, supply chain and cost reduction strategic initiatives. The prospects for our international businesses are also compelling as we see significant potential over the next few years to penetrate the markets we currently serve, enhance operating best practices, and further expand our geographic footprint.", "To summarize, we're off to a good start in fiscal 2018 and remain confident in our ability to deliver another strong year and achieve our current three-year plan financial targets. In closing, I would like to express my appreciation to all of our associates for their ongoing efforts and contributions as we strive to fully realize our vision for Sysco: to be our customers' most valued and trusted business partner.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Tom Ben\u00e9, President and Chief Operating Officer.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Sysco's financial results announced this morning reflect solid operating performance and continued progress against several of our key multi-year initiatives. While we did experience some temporary headwinds, including the impact of the hurricanes on some of our customers, rising inflation, and a challenging inbound freight environment, we remain on track to achieve a successful year and ultimately deliver on our three-year operating income target.", "Looking at our first quarter results by business segment, beginning with U.S. Foodservice Operations, sales grew 3.9% for the quarter, gross profit grew 3.8%, and gross margins remain flat. Adjusting for the hurricanes, gross profit dollar growth would have been approximately 4.3%. The growth in gross profit dollars can be attributed to the continued focus on category management including positive momentum from Sysco Brand and a balanced approach to pricing with our ongoing revenue management efforts.", "For the quarter, local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business remained strong at 2.8% and has now grown for 14 consecutive quarters. Adjusting for hurricanes, we believe that local case growth would have been over 3%. Our multi-unit customer segment declined, driving overall case growth to a modest 0.3%. As we've discussed, we have proactively managed our business in a more disciplined, profitable manner with multi-unit customers. We have recently begun to add some new customers and should see multi-unit growth begin to build in the second quarter and continue throughout the remainder of the year.", "While we do see customers' preference \u2013 consumers' preferences in restaurants continuing to include new, unique and customizable options that are fresh and healthy, we also see relative strength in concepts that offer convenience, low cost for consumers, and familiarity. These combined preferences benefit both our local and emerging multi-unit customers who provide value in terms of quality, dining environment, and a reasonable price point.", "From a product perspective, we continue to invest in our Sysco Brand as part of a larger brand revitalization effort including a reinvigoration of our portfolio that offers cleaner, fresher images for our branded products. These changes, along with new innovation, have positively contributed to brand growth, up another 82 basis points versus prior year.", "Regarding our supplier community, there were many examples during the recent storms where our supplier partners were there to support us and our customers who were in need. And I also want to share our thanks to all of those who supported us.", "Our digital ordering presence continues to grow and has now improved to approximately 40% of local cases ordered. This increased utilization is a result of our solid technology platform including improved product images and content, enhanced system capabilities, and increased levels of training. Also, as we centralized our support model for multi-unit accounts with tools such as order guide management, both Sysco and our customers have begun to see the benefits of working together to drive efficiencies in the business.", "Turning our attention to cost, our adjusted operating expense growth for the quarter was 3.2%. While there were some definite headwinds that drove our supply chain costs, we continue to see positive momentum from productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements. We are now implementing next evolution of tools to help streamline hours, improve delivery, and drive warehouse efficiencies. From an administrative cost perspective, we continue to focus on managing these expenses throughout the organization. Effectively managing overall cost structure remains a key priority for us, and we continue to focus on a variety of opportunities to deliver improvement.", "A key pillar of Sysco's strategy for growth and value creation is the continuous assessment of new market opportunities. As many of you know, we recently acquired HFM FoodService, a Hawaii-based broadline distributor with approximately $290 million in annual sales. HFM has been providing quality service to Hawaii and Guam for over 50 years. We're excited to welcome them to Sysco family. Acquiring HFM provides Sysco with direct access to the growing Hawaiian market and is in clear alignment with our strategy for disciplined, profitable growth of the business. We will report this business in our U.S. Foodservice segment going forward.", "Moving to International Foodservice Operations, we had mixed results for the quarter. With sales growing 6%, gross profit growing 3%, and adjusted operating expenses increasing 5%. Driven by investments in our European supply chain transformation, transition costs associated with a new large customer in Mexico, and currency translation in Canada. Overall adjusted operating income declined by 8% for the quarter.", "Our business in Canada is off to a great start this year. We are experiencing local case growth in most regions, especially in major markets. We are also thoughtfully sharing and implementing strategic initiatives from our U.S. business, such as revenue management and other customer-centric solutions, including online ordering, to their business. These capabilities, along with a more focused approach to local customers, have translated into accelerated local case growth. Additionally, we are effectively managing our cost structure and improving supply chain efficiencies to help maintain a healthy gap between gross profit growth and expense growth to drive our overall performance.", "Our European business is facing some macroeconomic headwinds, as customers are experiencing slower restaurant traffic and an overall slowdown in Food Away From Home in the UK. Additionally, the UK continues to experience acute inflation due to weakness in the pound sterling, which resulted in high food cost inflation of about 9% during the first quarter. While we expect these headwinds in the UK to continue throughout our fiscal year, we are actively managing the business to mitigate these impacts.", "As for our business in Latin America, we are excited about the growth opportunities in this region, although there were some weakness due to the recent earthquakes in Mexico City and expenses related to the addition of a large customer in Mexico that I mentioned earlier. In Costa Rica, we continued to see solid growth as we continue expanding our Cash & Carry footprint. Additionally, subsequent to the close of our first quarter, we have completed the purchase of the remaining 50% of the Mayca business in Costa Rica. We will use cash to complete this transaction, and our debt levels will not be affected. We initially purchased 50% of the business in 2014, and we are very pleased with the performance thus far, as adjusted EBITDA has doubled in the past three years. We look forward to continued success with the Mayca team.", "Lastly, our SYGMA segment continues to grow. We are focused on implementing operational improvements that will contribute to long-term operating income improvement.", "In summary, we feel good about the fundamentals of our business and about the trajectory that we're on for fiscal 2018, to close out our three-year plan.", "Despite the severe weather-related challenges we faced in Q1, we continue to make progress on our customer and operational strategies to improve our customer's experience, and I remain confident in our ability to deliver the high end of our adjusted operating income growth target of $600 to $650 million.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Bill and Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter. Our earnings growth reflects continued momentum from our business, including strong local case growth and good gross profit dollar growth and cost management.", "This morning, I'll start with our quarterly results on a comparable 13-week basis. For the quarter, sales grew 4.9%; gross profit grew 3.8%; while adjusted operating expense grew 3.2%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 5.6%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 10.4%, to $0.74.", "During the quarter, our results were impacted by both the impact of multiple hurricanes and a lower tax rate that, when factored together, would have resulted in operating income growth of more than 7% and earnings per share of $0.72, which is in line with our planned expectations.", "For the first quarter fiscal 2018, we saw inflation of 3.8% in our U.S. Broadline business. The pace of inflation has been rapid for a few categories, such as meat, poultry and dairy, ultimately driving overall inflation.", "During the quarter, we had gross profit growth of 3.8%, driven by local case growth and improved Sysco Brand penetration. Adjusted operating expenses grew 3.2% for the quarter, driven by increased transportation expenses and unusually lower bad debt expense in the prior year. In addition, our expenses include the impact of labor and related costs during the storms that we continued to pay, despite lower volumes in those affected areas.", "We continued to maintain a gap between gross profit dollar growth and adjusted operating expense growth. While the gap was not as strong as in prior quarters, we still feel good about the performance and the ultimate translation into adjusted operating income leverage and continued progress toward achieving our three-year plan objectives. Part of the compression of that gap can be explained by the impact of hurricanes and inbound freight, which negatively impacted cost of goods. In fact, adjusting for the impact of the hurricanes, the gap between gross profit dollars and expenses is approximately 1 point.", "As it relates to taxes, effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.7% compared to 32.9% in the prior-year period. Cash flow from operations was $83 million for the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2018. Net CapEx for the quarter was $135 million or about 1% of sales which was roughly flat to last year. Free cash flow for the first 13 weeks of fiscal 2018 was negative $52 million. It's important to note that the first quarter often produces negative free cash flow, largely due to investments in working capital. However, we continue to expect strong cash flow for the full fiscal year 2018.", "Now, I'd like to transition to three (sic) [four] (18:10) business updates. First, regarding second quarter expectations, we expect to see further softness in the International segment followed by a modestly stronger second half of the year as we align the Brakes Group calendar year to our fiscal year. Second, as we previously discussed, we will realize a one-time net benefit and depreciation expense related to technology changes. This benefit will be approximately $50 million recognized evenly over four quarters. Third, regarding share repurchases, we've been aggressive in the market as we've seen opportunities to repurchase shares this quarter. We've maintained our approach in purchasing shares opportunistically, but we do not expect that pace to continue for the balance of the fiscal year. Finally, a new accounting standard became applicable in fiscal 2018 that requires access \u2013 excess tax benefits or detriments from stock compensation to be recognized within the income statement in the income tax line.", "For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized the benefit of $15 million (19:25) as a reduction of income tax largely from stock option exercises that occurred in the first quarter. These tax benefits are difficult to predict and depend on factors such as our stock price and option exercise activity. Absent these tax benefits, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 35% and 36%.", "In summary, we had a solid quarter that reflected the continued momentum in our business. I remain confident that we are on track to achieve our three-year plan financial objectives, including the high end of the $600 million to $650 million range of improved adjusted operating income comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015 excluding Brakes.", "The fundamentals of our business remain strong as we continue to deliver strong local case growth and good gross profit dollar growth and cost management. We are committed to serving our customers and delivering a high level of execution in all areas of our business.", "I'll now turn it back over to Bill before we go to Q&A.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks, Joel. As you know, I will be stepping down as Sysco's CEO at the end of the calendar year, so this is my final earnings call. I'm the sixth CEO in Sysco's 47-year history as a public company, and serving in that capacity over the past nine years has been an honor. In addition, I have been truly privileged to work alongside hundreds of committed and highly-capable associates throughout my nearly 30-year career.", "Today, I would like to especially thank all of our associates who have supported me throughout my tenure as CEO. We faced many challenges together. Most importantly, we have together, as one Sysco, driven significant and much needed transformational change, expanded our international and domestic footprint, increased revenues by nearly $20 billion, and doubled Sysco's market capitalization.", "The great news is that there remains a lot of opportunity ahead and really good work to do. Tom Ben\u00e9 is the absolutely right person together with our leadership team to take Sysco to the next level, and I am confident you will be well-served by his leadership going forward.", "In closing, I just would like to note that I've been actively involved with Sysco's Investor Relations program during much of my career, including my early years in various Treasury functions and, of course, the past 11 years as CFO and now CEO. To those of you whom I've crossed paths with over the years, thank you for your interest in Sysco and for the respect you've provided me both in good and challenging times. I wish you all the very best.", "Operator we're now ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. John Heinbockel, your line is open.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Can you hear me?", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Can you hear me, guys?", "(22:45)", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "So, I was going to say in light of the 4% inflation rate in the U.S., flat gross margin was actually a fairly decent outcome. So, maybe talk about where we sit with the evolution of revenue management. And kind of what you're doing at the margin here on price elasticity?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "So, John, good morning. It's Tom. What I would say is that we talked a lot over the last couple years about all the tools that we've been building in the revenue management area and that we felt good that they were going to help us both in deflationary and inflationary times.", "And what I would just reiterate is that a lot of those tools \u2013 because what we are seeing in some of these categories is fairly heavy inflation in a couple of the ones that Joel highlighted: meat, poultry, dairy. And so what they really allow us to do is effectively pass on the pricing where we can, but do it in a balanced way such that our customers aren't feeling significant impacts over the short-term as well. So, it's really a matter of week-by-week providing our salespeople the right information, insight and guidance on how to basically price and be competitive in the marketplace.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, the \u2013 when you look at what needs to be done at Brakes, right, and I know you've obviously made some management changes there. If you think about the two or three things that Sysco can bring to Brakes in terms of best practice sharing, what are they? And what is the margin opportunity at Brakes today when you look at the delta versus where you guys sit in the U.S.?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "So, I assume \u2013 let's start with margin. When you talk about margin, you're probably talking about gross margin. And generally speaking, the margin \u2013 gross margin in Europe tends to be higher than what it is in the U.S. But their cost structures tend to be a little higher as well, which ultimately affects the operating margin.", "A lot of the activity that we've started to share, they have their own kind of category management approach and program, but we're starting to share more information between the European team and the U.S. team around how we might think about that process going forward. So, there could be some benefits regarding the product costs. But I'd say the bigger areas are probably around how we leverage some of the solutions we've built around the sales model here. We've talked over the last couple of years about the solutions that we've built out, whether it be things like business review or the revenue management capability, or even how we think about building out the branded portfolio in our Sysco Brand, and those all remain, I think, opportunities for us to help leverage some of that learnings out of the U.S. and share those best practices in Europe. And we've started that process already with that team.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "And, Tom, if I could just add one other thing to that. It's Joel. I think the supply chain piece is probably the other part that I would just add to that. I think, obviously, some of the investments that we've talked about that we continue to make are around continuing to enhance their transformational work on the supply chain side as well as, again, to (26:00) around putting some of those best practices in place. So, I think, just to add one other thing to Tom's point. I think I would \u2013 the other part I would single out is an opportunity for us.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And, Bill, congratulations on your retirement.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo", "Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. And, Bill, good luck in the future as well.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo", "So, I just wanted to start it \u2013 start on SG&A, particularly within the Foodservice side of the business. It was certainly higher than what we were expecting, up 3.2% on basically 30 basis points of case growth. Can you just provide more color on the impacts here? How much did the hurricane actually hurt that line item? The bad debt expense that you mentioned on the comparison side, what did that mean? And then can you talk about diesel costs and the impact that that had in the quarter as well?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yes, sure, Ed. This is Joel. I'm going to start. I think a couple parts to that. Number one, there was some impact on our cost per case as it relates to, again, what I'll just call overall productivity. In other words, there's certainly as part of that, there are admin costs that we continue to pay where we're not shipping case volumes in those areas. And so, that would have a negative impact on that leverage.", "From a bad debt perspective, a lot of that's related to some actually positive bad debt results we had in the prior year that were, I would say, significant relative to what would be normal for us. So, when that comparison hits, it actually elevates what would be a growth in our admin costs for this year on that side of it.", "I think a couple of other pieces of that, again, certainly from a segment perspective, as what I've talked about mostly relates to the U.S. side. We certainly did have some higher levels of expense growth in our International businesses, so much we've talked about. There's some start-up cost with a new customer in Mexico and some investment costs that we've put into the UK Again, all of that now is actually factored into our cost structure, which would not have been something you had been used to seeing as much last year because we'd always talked about ex Brakes but, obviously, includes all that and \u2013 so, I would say those are really some of the primary callouts and, again, the hurricane, again, did have some productivity impact there, without a doubt. But I think it's a few \u2013 collection of a few things. We still feel good about our ability to manage costs still in this area going forward.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "The only other thing...", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo", "Yes, got it.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. The only thing you mentioned...", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo", "I'm sorry, Tom.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "... was fuel. And so where's (28:48) about a penny detriment on fuel versus prior year. And the buildout, the cost comments that Joel made from an operating perspective, when you think about the way we run our business and the impacts of the \u2013 some of the storms, we still are basically paying all of our associates, drivers, warehouse, et cetera, without any case activity during those times. And so, that's what drove some of that incremental expense from an operating perspective as well.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo", "Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up. Profit per case on U.S. Foodservice has been really strong the last months \u2013 been strong for a while, but the last couple of quarters seemed notably strong. Can you just talk about that acceleration and the momentum? And then how does that change over the next few quarters as you have some new business coming in?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "So, Ed, I assume you're talking about gross profit per case.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo", "Yeah.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. So, it's a really good question given the inflationary environment we're experiencing. So, we continue to see our gross profit per case improve, even though, obviously, we haven't seen margin expansion during this time of inflation. So, we continue to feel good about that and that's a combination of things. It's the category management effort we've had going. We talked earlier about the increase in Sysco Brand, another 82-basis-point improvement with our local customers, which is again, as you think about the challenges on inflation we're seeing, our ability to give customers options, including Sysco Brand, and help them maintain their cost, while also delivering improved margins for us, is a kind of a win-win in there. And so, as we see our case volume increase, we would actually expect to see us continue to be able to manage that accordingly. And so, we do feel like you're going to see some improvements there, predominantly in this multi-unit side, as we continue to go forward throughout the year.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital. Your line is open.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to elaborate a little further on the international comments. I think you mentioned some further softness expected in 2Q, but an improvement in the second half? Did I hear that correctly, if \u2013 and can you elaborate on that?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yes, Kelly. I think, again, as I talked about \u2013 I mean, some of this is really related to what I'll call some timing elements of the fact that the previous fiscal year with Brakes was on a calendar basis. And just essentially moving that now to where their fiscal year aligns with our fiscal year does cause some changing of the way some things are recognized. And so I think, from a timing perspective, again, that impact is going to most notably hit us in the second quarter, which again, used to be their \u2013 the final quarter of their calendar year. And again, \u2013 but certainly we'll expect some level of pickup in that, in the second half of our year.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay, and the other question I wanted to ask was just on the corporate multi-unit trends. Do you continue to expect those to improve, I think, starting next quarter? Can you quantify the magnitude of that there, and is this a positive or a negative for gross margin within the U.S. Foodservice?", "32:10: So, I guess \u2013 let me take that at a high level, Kelly. It's, definitely, from an improvement \u2013 the trend's going to improve, okay? So, what's been going on as we've talked, we've been very thoughtful about the way we approach the multi-unit segment of our business. And we have had, obviously, some situations over the last year where we've not renewed some business, or lost some business there. And so, what we now are getting ready to do is lap some of that as we go into Q2, and we have picked up a couple of new customers as well. And so you \u2013 the combination of those things will in fact improve the multi-unit sales trends that we've been seeing for the last kind of three to four quarters.", "As far as gross margin, obviously, overall, that business is a lower margin than our local customers. As far as us sharing a specific number with you, it would be really difficult for us to do that. But you certainly will expect, as we get overall customer growth volume growing, that there will be some benefits to the gross profit dollar line. And it could have some impact on margin.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question and, Bill, of course, best of luck to you in the next chapter here.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Vinnie.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Just \u2013 absolutely. Just wanted to \u2013 I guess, just first going back to inflation. Just to kind of get your sense versus what you guys were expecting heading into the quarter. Obviously, 3.8% was a bit above probably most of our estimates on the line here. Just wanted to see kind of versus your internal expectations, and if any changes have happened since. And maybe \u2013 I know you mentioned there's been some kind of changes where you can promote some of your private label. Has that been kind of a meaningful change with the higher inflation?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Here, let me take the first part of your question and then I'll let Tom chime in on the other. I think the \u2013 it's Joel. I think the \u2013 certainly, Vinnie, I would say that the level that we've seen here in Q1 \u2013 say, it's fair to say, is higher than we anticipated. And I guess I would say that the speed to which it actually happened in a few of the categories we called out was, I'd say, something that happened faster than we anticipated.", "But I think, at the end of the day, it certainly, as Tom pointed out, I think that some of the things that we've done, in particular, RevMan, CatMan, certainly provided us with the tools and resources, and certainly provided our sales team with the opportunities to manage this fairly well and, again, I certainly \u2013 somebody called out earlier, I mean, the fact that our U.S. Broadline \u2013 our U.S. Foodservice, excuse me, segment was relatively flat from a margin perspective, I think, is pretty strong relative to where (35:02) \u2013 despite, again, as you pointed out, things that happened probably faster than we anticipated. Do you want to add anything to that, Tom?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. I think the only thing I'd add, Vinnie, is that obviously, we continue to see some inflation through at least the balance of the calendar year. There are some things, like produce, that we think might be impacted more, given the recent fires in California. So, there are going be some continued areas we're going to have to deal with. And again, as w talked \u2013 from the first question \u2013 I think we feel good about the tools we've got in place to manage through this. But as Joel said, these categories that move fairly quickly and fairly aggressively is where we run into the biggest challenge and we just \u2013 always you (35:42) need a little time to maneuver around that and work through it, but I think we're doing a pretty good job.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then, just a fast question on the International side, and I'm sure we'll get more color in December. But just around Brakes \u2013 it seems like the UK, obviously, has more of kind of the macro issues there. Would you say, though, that kind of the basis (36:07) of the business now, just over a year into the integration here, has been going relatively according to plan? And maybe just if there's any changes in any of the regions, more just on a competitive front or pretty much in line with your expectations?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, Vinnie. So, yeah, I would say it's relatively as we had expected and on plan. Now, having said that, we are making investments over there, as we've talked. The transformation efforts in the UK continue. We're looking to make some other investments in some of the other parts of Europe, including France. And so, I think we continue to believe that it's a great business, and one we see lots of potential out of. But there are some things we've not \u2013 need to get in place and operating the way we'd want, to get that type of growth in the future. The only other thing we already talked about with the UK in particular, and some of the macroeconomic challenges they have, the inflation there driven by the currency issues are significant.", "So, 9% inflation is a massive number. And we are seeing impacts from that. And we see that unfortunately, continuing for some period of time here. So, I'd say that's the only other piece of this that \u2013 that's different than what we had hoped or expected. Obviously, with Brexit happening, we knew there was going to be some impacts but it's sustained at fairly high levels for quite a while now.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Very helpful. Best of luck, guys.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. It's Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. And thanks for taking the question. Did you say what operating profit was excluding Brakes? We're just trying to get to what the three-year incremental operating profit is now and by our rough math it seems like you're up to $460 million, so you would need to generate almost $200 million the rest of this year to get to the high end. Does that sound right?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. So, this is Joel. I mean, we actually \u2013 if you want to take the dollars ex Brakes, we added $52 million operating income dollars, again, ex Brakes and so that takes us to a total of $469 million for the \u2013 for, now, the nine quarters of the three-year plan.", "Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. And would the $50 million D&A (38:19) benefit contribute towards the plan as well?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yes. Yes and, again, that's going be spread evenly across the four quarters of the year.", "Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. And on tax reform if it's passed and corporate rates are lowered, what are your views on whether or not incremental profit dollars will drop to the bottom line versus get computed (38:37) away?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Well, yes. First of all, it's \u2013 to you speculate on anything coming out of Washington right now is a little bit interesting. But I think the \u2013 yeah, look, we're a company that obviously has a large percentage of our profits in the United States and so, certainly, just based on that fact it certainly seems like a positive opportunity for us. I think the \u2013 in terms of passing some of that along, I \u2013 to be honest with you, I get asked this question a fair bit. I don't know that most of our customers spend a whole lot of time thinking about the correlation of prices and tax reform necessarily. So, I don't personally anticipate that being a significant issue either way, as it relates to this. But, certainly, again, overall, from our company's perspective, again, were that to happen, I think there's certainly some positive opportunities for us.", "Ryan Gilligan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "That's helpful. Thank you, and congratulations, Bill.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Ryan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "Hey. Good morning. Just on the private label or brand penetration itself, if we think about it over the next three to five years within both Broadline and local, where do you think that ultimate penetration goal could go? And maybe in that context, when you guys are having your conversations with your suppliers, how are those discussions going these days? Do you feel like maybe you're able to receive some greater concessions out of them if they're not necessarily providing innovative or value-added product?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Chris, from a Sysco Brand perspective, as you know, we've continued to see this grow over the last couple of years and our total business is up 62 basis points and 82 basis points with our local customers. So, we continue to see opportunities there. And we get asked this often is how high is \u2013 could it go? And I don't think we really have a good view of that. And the reason I say that is what we continue to focus on is bringing very high quality products to the market at very competitive pricing. And I think as our customers continue to feel different impacts whether that's the cost of labor, wage rate increases or other challenges they might feel in their business, product costs' always going be there. And we bring them alternative solutions with Sysco Brand.", "So, the other thing we've done \u2013 we've talked about is we've been focused on bringing innovative solutions and products with Sysco Brand to the market. And I think the combination of those things continues to be well-received by our customers and that's why we see these increases. So, I know that didn't answer you directly, but what I'd say is we continue to invest here. We feel good about it. I talked about this brand revitalization effort. We've been doing a lot of work around refreshing the look and the feel of those brands and making sure that they're on trend whether that's with fresh and local products or that's with the ripe (41:37) types of products, whether that be organic or wholesome type products. So, we \u2013 we're doing a lot of work in that area and it's \u2013 appears to be resonating nicely with our customers.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "All right. And the last one for me very quickly in terms of ROIC in the quarter as you calculate with and without Brakes, what was then numbers for those?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, the number, I think, in aggregate was 12.3%, as an overall enterprise. Actually, Chris, off the top of my head, I don't have that number without Brakes.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "That's okay. We can follow up. Thanks, guys.", "(42:14)", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the U.S. Broadlines business. When you exclude inflation in case growth, it looks like there were some other negative pricing impact to U.S. Broadline sales growth. So, can you just give us a little bit more detail on this and was it related to an inability to pass through all the inflation or was it a decision by Sysco to get sharper on pricing or was it a more competitive environment? Just more color there would be great.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, Marisa. I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. I think we feel really good about the U.S. Broadline business and we talk about it in context here of our U.S. Foodservice Operations segment. And given we talked about some of the impacts of the storms on both volume and on gross profit dollars, and obviously the impacts on costs as well. So, I think when you think about everything that that business went through in this first quarter, we continue to feel very good about how we're managing it, including some pretty significant inflation in the quarter. So, I \u2013 the fact that we're basically flat on our gross margin given all those circumstances, we feel actually very good about that business.", "Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Right. And then have you \u2013 are you at the point where you're getting any push back on the ability to pass inflation onto customers now that it's close to 4%?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Again, I'd say as we always talk, that's an average. So, category by category, sure, we run into some challenges from time to time and that's where we leverage things like Sysco Brand. And, candidly, we share a lot of information with our customers, so this isn't about just us moving our pricing. We share a lot of industry information with them, what's going on in the various categories and why the costs are going up from suppliers the way they are. So, it's \u2013 we're pretty transparent in that area and we try to spend a fair amount of time educating our own people so they can obviously educate our customers.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "And the only thing I'd say, Marisa \u2013 I mean, again, we had a \u2013 despite all those things, we still had a very strong local case growth as well. So, I mean, when we combine that with some of the \u2013 again, holding a flat margin during this time, I can overall \u2013 certainly, on a customer-by-customer basis, could there be some pushback? Sure. But I think overall we've done a good \u2013 really good job there.", "Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And then, just lastly, I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the sales performance of your non-restaurant customer and how you're thinking about sales and margin opportunities within that segment.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "When you say non-restaurant customers, are you just talking about other segments within...", "Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Like hospitals. Well, it'd be like hospitals, schools, kind of the \u2013 some of the institutional customers.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "We feel good about them. I think that we continue \u2013 we're fortunate that we've got this broad segment that we operate in, our customer segments, and our mix is such that while restaurants certainly represent a big chunk of it, there are lots of other customer segments. As we've talked in the past, we see growth in areas like the foodservice management and also in the retail foodservice. So, I think the other segments continue to grow. Healthcare's always been a pretty good-sized segment for us and we are performing well there also. So, I think we feel great about the balance that exists across the segments. And I'd like to mention (45:47), other than making some decisions around certain multi-unit customers, we feel really good about where we are.", "Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks so much and best of luck, Bill.", "William J.

One quick housekeeping one. Could you give us an idea of what the blended interest rate on your debt was this quarter?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. Karen, we'll have to get back to you on that.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, looking at some of your commentary earlier about seeing strengths in brands that are familiar, convenient value, is that really a comment on maybe some strengths in fast food relative to casual dining as a category with what you're seeing in your customers?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "I think it's commentary not necessarily on fast food but on independent restaurants and what we continue to believe is why they are positioned well to grow. And so, there are, obviously, more flexible menus, more ease of creating the right environment for consumers. And so, it has more to do with just acknowledging that there are lots of things still happening in that restaurant space and these newer concepts, whether they're independent or small multi-unit chains, they are continuing to see growth because they are bringing the kind of things that consumers are looking for to the market.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "And then one other quick housekeeping. Are there any calendar shifts we should be thinking about into the next quarter with Christmas switching \u2013 moving off of the weekend?

You're very welcome.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you. I appreciate it.", "Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "So, I think, Tom, in your introductory comments, it sounded like ex hurricane, the U.S. business accelerated a little on the case side and was a little better on the gross margin side. So first, just to kind of check that, if you take the markets that were not impacted by the hurricanes, was case growth in fact \u2013 the local case growth, over 3%?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yes. In many cases it was.", "Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. But in total \u2013 I mean, I'm just trying to get some \u2013 because, obviously, estimates are one thing and then there's other ways to sort of get...", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Well. (48:38)", "Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "I guess, another way I want to ask it is \u2013 and it's sort of related so, is \u2013 how are these hurricane markets doing post hurricane? There's a lot of different theories, some is people are pent up and they want to go out to eat. Others is businesses are closed, people are moving. Are those markets normalizing? And are they running decently?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. I would say, ex a couple of key geographies, right? So whether it's here in the southeast where there are restaurants that are still closed or in parts of Florida like the Keys, where things are \u2013 many things are still closed. Much of the market is starting to get back to a normalized state. So, I would say yes, in general.", "Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And related to that, the math, if you just take the math of what you said, it looked like the $10 million hurricane impact to the operating profits really came out of the case side and the gross profits. But it also sounded like, from what, Joel, some of your commentary, it might have also been in the OpEx side which I also would have expected. So, could you talk a little about that $10 million? Is it a, kind of, a hard estimate or how did you get to that?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Well, so look, it's a fairly \u2013 I get it. It's high level. It's ball park. It's directional. I \u2013 it's, I think, again reasonably, and accurate, I think it is \u2013 yeah, we looked at it mostly all along the lines of what you said, from a volume and gross profit impact. Certainly from a productivity impact, again, as we described it earlier, it's interesting, I mean (50:14) our costs to some extent didn't go up, if you want to call it that. Because we had \u2013 we're paying people, whether it's drivers, whether it's administrative people, we're paying them, irregardless of whether we're shipping cases or not. And so, I would say, in general, from a productivity standpoint on a per case basis, we actually had some impact there. But I \u2013 so again, it's \u2013 again, Andy, it's not an exact science but we certainly got what we thought was a pretty reasonable view of it. And what we quantified was mostly on the gross profit piece of that. And probably, maybe a little conservative on our part but we thought it was a reasonable view of what happened.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "And, Andy, that was all based on case...", "Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Got it.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "All based on case volume, right. We didn't project any impact on a rate basis from gross profit per case. We just looked at purely at cases. And you asked about the 3%, we think that's a fairly conservative estimate, given what our run rates were in those markets.", "Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Got it. Thank you. And just wanted to follow up on Brakes, and my last question is \u2013 just like, as you look \u2013 Joel, you mentioned you're reconciling or harmonizing the fiscal years, and that obviously has some tweaks to it. But is most of the slowing from just what's going on there with the cost inflation and consumer \u2013 fundamentals side, with what's going on in the UK? Or how would you portion it, between timing reconciliations and a little fundamental slowing, or some fundamental slowing?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I'll start and Tom can chime in. I'd say, Andy, it's really some of both. Again, I think what I would say to you is that some of the timing issue is going to become more accelerated in the second quarter, which is why we're calling that out. Which again, will then rebound to some extent, in the second half of the year. But I would say for this particular quarter, it was some of both.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "I don't have anything really incremental to add. I mentioned earlier some of the other impacts from \u2013 as you mentioned, from inflation and some of the macros in the UK.", "Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Could you talk a little about the rationale for the recent deals off mainland U.S.? You gave some details on HFM, but how do you think about this deal and the completion of the Costa Rica stake versus opportunities that would be, kind of, more in and around your core or existing infrastructure?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Let me \u2013 I'll talk about those two, and then I'll let Joel embellish on kind of our broader strategy there. The \u2013 let's start with the Mayca in Costa Rica. So, as I mentioned, that was a business that we went into a joint venture with back in 2014. We feel great about the partnership we've had with the folks at Mayca. And as I shared, the results have been very positive over the last couple of years. So we exercised our option to basically acquire that business completely recently. And so, that's an example of where we started down a path with a partner and liked the way it progressed, them leveraging what they could from Sysco, and obviously them doing a great job in their marketplace.", "Separate that from HFM, which is just an outright acquisition and a market within the U.S. that's been white space for us. Other than some export business into Hawaii, we don't really have much of a footprint. We'd have no footprint there, and we didn't really do a lot of business there, so it's a white space opportunity that we're very excited about. They're a terrific distributor with businesses on a lot of the islands, and are really excited about what we can do together in Hawaii. As far as other types of acquisition, I'll let Joel talk a little bit about how we think about it and where you might see us focusing.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. I think the way I would characterize it, I mean, it's a little bit coincidental, I would say, in terms of timing, that we had two acquisitions we announced that were both on islands here. But I think in general, I would tell you that our overall strategy around M&A, it's \u2013 those are both very consistent with that. We're very \u2013 continue to be very focused on opportunities within our own domestic and core markets, or areas that might supplement our existing businesses, as well as geographic expansion.", "And so, I would just say, again, the timing probably a little coincidental on those two things, but our acquisition strategy has remained very consistent. And those two deals are very much a part of our overall strategy.", "William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. That's it for me.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah, good morning. Just a question and some clarification here, on how the local case volume trends were during the quarter in the markets that weren't impacted by the hurricanes? Did those accelerate throughout the quarter?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Shane, did they accelerate? So, I mean, when you think about this, we're \u2013 we break our U.S. out into six markets. And so, as you guys know, I mean, different things drive the business in different markets, not the least which is overall population growth, economic impact. So, what \u2013 as we said earlier, we saw good growth outside of those other markets, generally speaking, in the U.S. And so, we feel pretty comfortable with the numbers we've shared regarding the impacts due to the hurricane in primarily what we call in our South and Southeast markets.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks for that. And how are case volumes trending 2Q to date?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "We continue to feel very good about the growth that we've had in the \u2013 both local, and as I mentioned, change in multi-unit.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And just had a question on the \u2013 you guys called out some challenging inbound freight environment. Could you just give a little bit of color on kind of what changed there during the quarter, and what you guys are doing to mitigate these headwinds?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I would just \u2013 I'll take that. It's Joel. And I would just say in general, the way to think about it is that there's been some level of shortage of drivers in inbound freight, and that's something that was happening somewhat prior to the hurricane, and then that got accelerated by the bad weather. So, lots more sheetrock being moved, and I would say carriers are taking the opportunity to move more expensive loads, and that doesn't always necessarily \u2013 that pinches supply on our side.", "And so, that was something \u2013 again, at the end of the day, our product costs is basically the cost of our products plus the costs of inbound freight. There's some increases there from an inbound freight perspective and, certainly, that's something, as we move forward, continue to find ways to mitigate that \u2013 it's continued somewhat here and as we moved into this quarter.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then congratulations, Bill. That's it for me. Thanks.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Bill, I also wanted to say congratulations and wish you good luck in your retirement.", "William J. DeLaney - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Ajay.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Now that you've anniversaried Brakes, would it be possible to break out the actual currency impact, both in terms of revenues and operating profit? Maybe you already mentioned that earlier and I might have missed it, but it would be nice to get a sense of the actual operating performance in International after stripping out the currency impact, especially for the markets that Brakes operates in. So, if you can comment on case trends for International and also the overall currency impact, that would be great. I'm assuming that you can track those things a lot more easily now that you've cycled Brakes.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yes, so Ajay, again, so the breaking out specifically \u2013 again, we're \u2013 we don't \u2013 we don't typically do that. What \u2013 here's what color I would give you, though. I mean, and actually general, the impact of foreign exchange overall for us has been relatively negligible for this quarter. So, there is \u2013 some of this stuff we've talked about that Tom referred to in terms of the weakness of the sterling really has played itself out in the selling margins. Because there's a fairly sizable percentage of products that the UK, or that are bought outside the UK, which has impacted the selling margins, but if you actually look at the overall impact of foreign exchange \u2013 again, the U.S. dollar's been somewhat weaker out there, the Canadian dollar, as well as the euro. Then there has been some impact where the sterling has continued to weaken. But \u2013 yet overall, on the top line and certainly on our operating income line, there's been a relatively minimal impact overall on foreign exchange. More on the top than overall, but again, not much on our operating income line when you aggregate everything.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay. So, going forward should we infer that you're not going be breaking out the currency impact based on the year-over-year comparisons?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Well, I guess, I would say in this particular case, it's \u2013 it was not significant and we didn't do it. If it's something really significant, we'll probably break it out.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay. And just one follow-up in terms of the U.S. local case growth, you've had a pretty impressive run now in terms of local case volume. So, over the past couple of years since the start of your three-year growth plan, has there been any noticeable shift in terms of where that volume is coming from at this point? Are you selling more cases to existing customers or is the local case growth coming more from new business? I'm sure you'll probably say it's a little of both, but if you can comment, that would be great.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Sure. And it is obviously both. We track both penetration which means more sales to existing customers as well as new lost business. And I would say in each of those areas, they've continued to grow. In Foodservice and generally, new business is very important because there are a fair amount of customers each year that cycle for various reasons. And so, I'd \u2013 it's a pretty good balance actually of both though. And I'd say the thing for us that we've really tried to focus on is penetration because we believe that the more products and service that we can provide a customer, obviously, that also provides more \u2013 what we call maybe stickiness or loyalty from those customers. You heard me talk in the past about loyalty and we continue to have a positive trend in our loyalty metrics, including about a 3-point improvement in the first quarter. So, we feel good about what we're hearing from our customers as far as what we're providing them.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. I think at this point my question is limited to some comments that Tom made in, I think, his prepared remarks around not just the move towards healthy, local, organic in terms of consumer preferences which is pretty easily understood. But also the comment around convenience, low cost, and familiarity. I interpreted that either in terms of traditional fast food which is obviously done very well over this cycle, but it could also mean things that aren't necessarily restaurants, like convenience stores or maybe other types of Foodservice operations that are more hybrid in terms of what their approach is. So, could you elaborate on that sub segment and how big of an opportunity that is relative to the business that you're currently serving?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Sure. First of all, I think you articulated it actually pretty well. And so, I think that that's \u2013 it was good to hear that what we said is \u2013 was translated, I guess, by you in the right way. I think, there's some of this is certainly the retail segment that we've talked about. We do see it continuing to grow. But the other segment that we all know is growing is this \u2013 kind of think about as prepared meals and this ability to get your \u2013 whatever your favorite restaurant is delivered to you now versus having to either go there to dine in or even to go pick it up. And we continue to see that movement happening. And there are lots of different folks getting into that space now in these prepared foods that are both retail, but also in many cases in foodservice outlets that are handling that. And so I think the more those folks continue to grow, that just provides more opportunities for our customers to grow and for consumers to get access to things that they like and enjoy. And so, that's really \u2013 is what we were trying to refer to there.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So, that sounds more independent restaurants and chains or maybe that also includes some smaller chains in that segment? And are you alluding to meal kits as well? Or is that a different segment than what you want to be doing?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yes to your first part of your question and comment. And as far as meal kits, yeah, it's part of it. It's a fairly small segment and while I think it's still got some growth in it, as we've all seen, there's a lot of movement going on in that space right now. I think what we're seeing, though, is there are \u2013 think about it, instead of someone like a Blue Apron where you're having to get something shipped to you, there are local outlets that are accomplishing that same type of solution for customers or for consumers on a local level, whether that be an independent or a chain who are providing that same type of service.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "William J.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.", "Neil A. Russell - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks, Megan, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Sysco's Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. Joining me in Houston today are Tom Ben\u00e9, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner.", "Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings.

Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results represent continued momentum in the business, most notably in the top line fundamentals, driven primarily by solid case growth. The quarterly results also include some circumstances that created gross profit and expense challenges as well as some tax-related impacts that Joel will describe in a few minutes. Nonetheless, our strategy of delivering disciplined profitable growth remains our focus, and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year fiscal 2018 financial targets.", "Our results for the second quarter include: sales increase of 7.1% to $14.4 billion, driven by U.S. Broadline local case growth of nearly 5%; gross profit growth of 5%; and adjusted operating expense growth of 5.3%, which delivered an adjusted operating income increase of 3.9% to $579 million; and an adjusted EPS increase of 34% to $0.78. Further adjusting to remove the beneficial change in our statutory tax rate, adjusted earnings per share grew 13.8% to $0.66. Joel will take you through the details in a few minutes.", "We achieved these results in a favorable macroeconomic environment propelled by steady spending from businesses and households in the United States. Market conditions in the U.S. for foodservice operators remained somewhat favorable as sales at restaurants continue to rise, offsetting somewhat lower traffic counts. Economic growth in the international markets in which we operate is mostly positive, including modest growth in the foodservice sector. However, significant food cost inflation in our UK business, driven by a combination of both product cost increasing, along with less favorable currency translation, impacted both our volume growth and gross margins.", "Transitioning to our quarterly results by business segment, beginning with U.S. Foodservice Operations. Sales grew 6.6% for the quarter, gross profit grew 5.1%, operating expenses grew 5.9% and operating income grew 3.6%. For the quarter, local case growth in our U.S. Broadline business was very strong at 4.8% and has now grown for 15 consecutive quarters. Local case growth, excluding acquisitions, was also strong at 4%. Cases grew by nearly 2% with national customers, driving overall case growth to a healthy 3.5%. The national customer case growth is the result of recently added new customers and we will continue to look for opportunities to grow in this segment in a disciplined and profitable manner.", "While we are pleased with the gross profit growth we delivered this quarter, we continue to face challenges from escalating inbound freight costs, which have provided headwinds to our gross profit dollar growth. The industry is facing driver availability challenges, which is leading to increased lane rates for many carriers. As a result, our cost to move products has increased, and we've had to utilize more spot loads to transport goods. We are actively working to mitigate these risks and continue to ensure that Sysco remains a preferred customer with various carriers we work with.", "From a product perspective, Sysco Brand continues to grow with local customers, making up almost 46% of cases purchased, which is up 37 basis points for the quarter versus the prior year. The consistent success we've seen is driven by a few factors, including the breadth of products that are offered across multiple categories and tiers, along with continued progress from our brand revitalization work and new innovation concepts.", "Some examples of this work include products that offer our customers unique value through labor savings as well as on-trend products that fulfill specific customer needs. Our e-commerce ordering utilization continues to grow, and early indicators tell us Sysco customers who shop via digital platforms have higher penetration numbers versus customers who do not. We are pleased to see increased utilization. However, we continue to believe that providing choice to our customers in how they want to interact with us is the right strategy to ensure the best possible customer experience.", "Turning our attention to cost in our U.S. Foodservice Operations. Our operating expense growth for the quarter was roughly 6%, driven by volume-based supply chain costs, startup costs related to some new national account business recently signed, continued investment in our selling organization and increased fuel prices. In supply chain, some of these costs are offset by improvements in productivity that are result of reengineering the delivery process to be more efficient while also providing higher service levels.", "In the selling organization, we are once again adding marketing associates in an effort to accelerate our local sales and are doing so through a targeted insights-based approach where we have the greatest opportunities for growth. We continue to believe that our consultative approach to selling is the key driver for local case growth, and we believe these efforts will continue to enrich our customers' experience of doing business with Sysco.", "Moving on to International Foodservice Operations. We had mixed results for the quarter with sales growing 9.3%, gross profit growing 4.1%, adjusted operating expenses growing 11.9%, and adjusted operating income declining 28.8%, driven by the reporting change from a calendar year to a fiscal year, investments in our supply chain transformation, and new change initiatives targeted to grow local customers all within our European business. Additionally, we had transition costs associated with the acquisition of a large customer in Mexico.", "Our business in Canada had a strong quarter, with gross profit dollar growth of more than 4% and an operating leverage gap of nearly 2 points. This led to strong operating income growth, driven by an improving macroeconomic environment, increased restaurant traffic and improved execution of our customer-centric strategy.", "Our business results across Europe were mixed. Looking at overall product costs, the UK continued to experience acute inflation of about 6% during the second quarter, driven by a combination of Eurozone sourcing and the relative impact of the pound sterling versus the euro. Also in the UK, we continue to invest in the supply chain transformation to multi-temperature facilities and fleet as well as new initiatives such as technology solutions that are being implemented to enrich the customer experience, which will ultimately lead to improved loyalty and local case growth.", "Outside of the UK business, France and Ireland are performing well. France is driving solid top-line growth while recently completing key IT milestones that will help us to integrate the Davigel and Brake France businesses. This is another important step to build on our position as a leading European foodservice provider.", "In Ireland, we are ahead of expectations in cost synergies from the merging of Brakes Ireland and Pallas Foods. And finally, in Sweden, we recently acquired a small produce company that has broadened the range of fresh fruit and vegetable products offered to our customers and we are seeing positive trends as a result.", "As for our business in Latin America, we continue to be excited about the growth opportunities in this region. In Costa Rica, we continue to see solid growth and have continued our expansion of Cash & Carry locations to complement our Broadline footprint. In Mexico, we're absorbing the costs of adding a new customer and are due to annualize that addition next quarter. We remain confident in the performance of Mexico and expect continued growth in the future.", "Our SYGMA segment continues to grow and performed well this quarter, producing high single-digit growth in sales and gross profit while expanding gross margins by 6 basis points. Operating income grew approximately 6%, and we are focused on continuing to improve operational performance that will contribute to long-term operating income growth.", "And lastly, our Guest Supply entity continues to be a great business model, serving our hotel customers with various products and services, which help them to be successful. Although their overall results were slightly down for the quarter, we are confident in their ability to deliver growth in fiscal year 2018 and remain excited about the long-term potential for this business.", "In summary, we feel good about the fundamentals of our business and about the trajectory we're on for fiscal 2018 to close out our initial 3-year plan. Despite the inbound freight and unique expense challenges we experienced in the second quarter, we continue to make progress on our customer and operational strategies to improve our customers' experience.", "One example of this is Sysco's redesigned website sysco.com, which we'll be launching this week. This site will be enhanced to further enrich our customers' overall experience of partnering with Sysco and to provide all those looking to engage with Sysco, a clear understanding of the company's differentiated position within the foodservice industry. Showcasing Sysco's breadth of industry-leading innovative solutions, including products, services, and customer-facing technology, the updated site will reinforce Sysco's brand and recent positioning at the heart of food and service.", "With that, now I'll turn the call over to Joel Grade, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the top-line fundamental results for the second quarter. Our earnings growth reflects strong sales and case growth, partially offset by challenges from inbound freight, increased investment in our sales force and national customer startup costs in our U.S. operations. In addition, our continued transformation investments and integration costs in Europe, as well as the reporting change from a calendar year to fiscal year impacted our performance for the quarter.", "This morning, I'll start with our quarterly results. For the quarter, sales grew 7.1%. gross profit grew 5% while adjusted operating expenses grew 5.3%, which resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 3.9% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 34.5% to $0.78 per share. As Tom mentioned, when further adjusting for the tax benefit, our adjusted earnings per share grew 13.8% to $0.66. This further adjustment assumes a consistent statutory tax rate to the previous year and provides a better apples-to-apples comparison of performance on an EPS basis.", "For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we saw foreign exchange benefit to sales of approximately 1%. Sysco experienced inflation across all of our segments in the second quarter. In our U.S. Broadline business, we experienced 3.3% inflation, driven by a few categories including meat, dairy and produce. The pace of inflation increases in some of these categories was rapid, ultimately driving overall inflation.", "Within our international business, inflation was a combination of both product costs increasing along with currency translation in the UK. During the quarter, we had gross profit growth of 5%, driven by overall volume growth and improved Sysco Brand penetration. As Tom mentioned earlier, the increased inbound freight expense is a headwind for gross profit dollars as both the product cost and associated inbound freight both reside in our gross profit line.", "Adjusted operating expenses grew 5.3% for the quarter. The increase in expense is largely due to overall volume growth, new customer startup costs, increased investments in our sales force and increased fuel prices in our domestic business as well as investments in our transformation and integration costs in our international business. As a result, we did not leverage operating expense growth to gross profit dollar growth in the way that we would have liked to. However, we expect to improve this trend in the third quarter and for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "As it relates to taxes, our results for the second quarter were impacted by excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and additional tax credits. In addition, per the new tax reform legislation, we incurred a provisional estimated charge of $115 million for our onetime transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. And we incurred a provisional estimated benefit of $15 million related to the remeasurement of our accrued income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the change in our U.S. tax rate. Because we are halfway through our fiscal year, our U.S. statutory tax rate is prorated to 28%, retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year.", "Our second quarter income tax expense include a tax benefit of approximately $64 million related to applying the lower rate to year-to-date earnings. Our U.S. statutory tax rate will change to 21% in fiscal year 2019.", "Cash flow from operations was $933 million for the first half of fiscal 2018. Net CapEx for the first half of the year was $255 million or about 1% of sales, which was roughly flat to last year. Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2018 was $679 million, which is $313 million higher compared to the same period last year. The significant improvement in free cash flow is largely driven by cash taxes that were not paid in the second quarter due to flood relief associated with Hurricane Harvey. We continue to expect strong cash flow for the full fiscal year 2018.", "Now I'd like to transition to three business updates: first, regarding second half expectations. We still expect to see a stronger second half of the year including the international segment, as we align the Brakes Group calendar year to our fiscal year. Second, regarding U.S. tax reform. We currently estimate $200 million to $300 million in annual savings from lower taxes as a result of the Tax Act. We will continue to evaluate our options with regard to how to best utilize these savings and will do so consistent with our capital allocation priorities.", "Finally, as a financial update, we expect our earnings per share for the second half of fiscal 2018 to be positively impacted by $0.09 to $0.13 as a result of tax reform changes related to the ongoing effective tax rate.", "In summary, I remain confident that we're on track to achieve our three-year plan financial objectives, including the high end of the $600 million to $650 million range of improved adjusted operating income comparing fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2015, excluding Brakes. The fundamentals of our business remained strong as we expect to deliver solid local case growth and good gross profit dollar growth along with improved cost management. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. Good morning. Was hoping you could just help us kind of understand the components of the pressures on the margin, the inbound freight, the investments in the sales force and the startup costs. Can you quantify those? And just particularly on the inbound freight costs, how are you thinking about passing those along if those continue? And what is the mechanism to pass those on, on the local side and the multiunit side?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Good morning, Kelly. Let me take a cut at that and then give Joel an opportunity as well. Let's start with the freight and the margin side. So inbound freight obviously does impact our gross margins. And as I think everyone's fairly aware, there's been significant increases, specifically in spot loads in the marketplace, driven by carrier challenges with drivers primarily. A lot of it started with some of the recent storm activity in the our first quarter or the third quarter in the U.S. and has continued and we continue to see that impacting our business. We're able to pass on some of that certainly to our contract customers, and we are doing everything we can to try to move that along as quickly as possible.", "But on our local customers, it's obviously a little more sensitive. We're having to deal with both product inflation and the cost of that inbound freight. And it's just a balancing act of how much of that you can move through at any point in time with those local customers. And so, we continue to work on that. We, I think, are doing as good a job as we can, leveraging in some of those tools we've built in our past and we've talked about regarding revenue management. But the fact remains that the rates that are increasing in some of those spot loads are dramatic, and we are struggling to be able to pass all that along.", "That's one of the primary drivers obviously of the margin impact. The other things that we can talk more about is some of that customer mix is impacting margin. And obviously, the impact of inflation, while we're able to pass along some of that on a percentage basis, it's affecting the gross profit percentage. And then on costs, you'd asked about cost, a couple of comments there. The investment to sales force, we are, in fact, adding additional marketing associates. We believe that we got into a point where you heard us talk about leveraging data and analytics to target those resources. We're at a place where we believe we now can add effectively. Even though we're getting some leverage with e-commerce, we feel like there's enough opportunities, and we know where those opportunities are that we're now adding marketing associates again. And we feel really good about that and really do believe that will help us continue to accelerate our local case growth. So those are a couple of the headlines. Joel, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I think the only other thing I'd add is, we talked about some of the startup costs, again, we certainly have continued to talk about our disciplined approach to growing our business. And we did, as Tom mentioned earlier, take on some additional multiunit business and have incurred some startup costs associated with that. And so, I think the one thing I would take away from a lot of that stuff, certainly, some of the challenges in the inbound freight were certainly actively again (22:21) to do something with. And these other areas with some of the investments in the sales force as well as some of the startup costs for some of these multiunit customers certainly over time obviously, we expect some benefit out of that to come through.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just another one on the local case growth, obviously very strong, ahead of your target for the next couple of years I think the strongest growth on the local in several years over the past couple of years. But just curious if you feel like that was market share gains on the local side or you feel like that local customer in general is improving? I know it's hard to pinpoint, but what's your sense just from talking to your customers?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "I think, Kelly, it's a combination of all. I think we're certainly having success and gaining some share in certain markets. And I think as we've talked we feel pretty good about that local or independent customer, that restaurant operator, in particular their ability to continue to grow in the local marketplace. So I think it's a combination of both.", "Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey great, good morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So just to go back, I know the big question on folks mind of course around is kind of the margins. And as you had mentioned in the past, in an inflationary environment, should we basically think of it as obviously the dollar's going up, the percentage going down. But I guess, more of my question is, as we're getting into the second half of the year when you're starting to go against compares that are less increases from last year, should we \u2013 I guess, maybe just any thoughts on how you see that in the back half of this year for folks would be helpful.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "So again \u2013 Vinnie, good morning.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "One, I think you got it right. Obviously, as with inflation, margin dollars are going to go up generally and the percentages are going to be pressured a bit. And we are seeing that. As an example, our gross profit per case has actually gone up in the second quarter. So we feel good about that. Remember though, this inbound freight thing is going to impact our gross profit line as well, so you got to continue to keep that in mind. That's beyond the inflation. And then I think as you think about it going forward, we're going to have some of those inbound freight challenges, we believe, will still be with us in the next couple of quarters. We're going to do everything we can to mitigate that and pass along where we can, but we know that's going to continue to be in there.", "And I think not knowing exactly how inflation is going to play out and as you guys know and as we talked about a lot, it's not \u2013 even though it's an average number we talk about, there are certain categories that are moving a lot more than others and produce is a great example of that, certainly impacted by some of the activity and the storm activity that's affected various parts of the U.S.", "So longwinded way of saying I think modeling going forward, you should probably expect some continued pressure on the gross margin percentage. But we should be continuing to be able to grow our gross profit dollars at the rates we've talked about, and our \u2013 for case gross profit, we anticipate to also be favorable.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yes. And I would just add, I mean, I think when you look at some of the other components, I mean, our Sysco Brand percentage continues to perform well. We continue to have benefit from category management. So I mean, there are some puts and takes on this. Certainly, we're calling out some of the headwinds, some of the challenges, but we certainly have some good things happening as well. And so, I think in general, we actually feel good about that moving forward. And certainly, on the margin piece, again when you factor out the impact of the freight and some of the inflation impact, again, I think overall, our margins are actually in a decent place as well.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. Just if you can give a little bit of an update just on the UK business? Obviously, we know that you've got inflation and some currency effects going on there. But just maybe more on kind of the fundamental investments that you guys have been making. I know you said kind of we're making these now for the longer term. But if you could give us an update maybe how kind of far in you are? Is that something that we should expect to kind of wind down over the next couple of quarters? How should we think about that?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "So good question. And so the UK is probably, of all those markets, the most unique. Everything from the Brexit impacts that are still obviously not all that clear and yet would be \u2013 ultimately the outcome of that's going to be in the marketplace. Because we source a lot of products for the UK out of other parts of Europe, that impact \u2013 the Brexit \u2013 Brexit basically, but on the pound sterling versus the euro, it's certainly having an impact on our costs. Therefore, the inflation we're having to try to pass along in the marketplace is quite high. And so, we've struggled to be able in all cases move that completely through and remain competitive.", "So we talked about the impacts both on our gross profit, but also on our volume in that market. And some of that's driven by the competitiveness, and some of that's driven by the consumer not being as confident in that market as maybe they are certainly here in the U.S. And so, I think we're going to continue to see some of that on the margin line.", "Regarding costs, when we acquired that business, they were on their journey of this multi-temp transformation. We are accelerating some of that across the UK and looking to get that in place. And so we still have certainly, I'd say another year or so of investments there that we have to make to get that up and running. And we feel good about it. We think it's the right thing for the long-term and it will certainly put us in a very solid position in the UK. But that investment's going to continue for a little while here.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. And I think just a couple of things on that also. Just in addition to the multi-temp transformation, there are some things that we're doing even from, in terms of the way we go to market there that we're making some investments as well. And so again some of that's going to be ongoing. The one thing I'll remind you though, and that we've been calling this out over the last couple of quarters, just to remind you. I mean there was a calendarization impact that you saw this quarter, and again we've certainly been foreshadowing here because as we switched the Brakes Group from a calendar year to a fiscal year, again, all those things were true about some of the investments in here. But again, just a reminder, some of the \u2013 I'd say somewhat acute performance that you saw this quarter certainly also, in large part, is related to some of the transformation in the year or the calendar, excuse me, transforming from a calendar year to our fiscal year, and some of that impacts is going to \u2013 you'll see some of that picked up in the second half of the year.", "Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks very much, guys. Good luck.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "So a couple of things. Let me start with, is inflation continuing to run here in this quarter kind of in that 3% range? And with respect to, have you seen any change in pricing, right? Because you look at the pickup in local case growth, I assume that had very little to do with any change in pricing on your end, so the price environment remains rational, is that fair?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, John. Yes, a couple. So inflation, yes, we expect it to continue kind of the same pace that it has been. And from a pricing standpoint, no, we didn't see really any major changes or impacts. And certainly, we aren't investing in price at this point. So don't believe that's an issue or will be one going forward other than the normal competitive environment we operate in.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And if I look in the U.S. business, the margin pressure this quarter, do you think was that evenly split between inbound freight and impact of inflation, right? So inbound freight may be in that 10 basis point to 15 basis point range or is that not right?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "I don't know, we want to get that specific. Let me just remind you and everyone. We feel actually really good about the gross profit increase this quarter. We were up 5% in the U.S. and that's a really positive number even of the case growth numbers that we shared. So yes, all those things are impacting that number, including the addition of, while our local was good, we also had an increase in the CMU business, so that national account business, and those all impact that gross margin number.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yes, I would say, John, just on a real high level, there's probably a little more impact of inflation than the other, just kind of a high level.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "All right. And then lastly, right, if you think about getting to $650 million for the year, right, your target pre-Brakes, U.S. EBIT probably has to step up from where it is, 300 basis points or 400 basis points in terms of growth. What's the biggest thing that changes? And is it more on the SG&A line? Or I imagine it's more on that line than gross or is that not right?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. It's on the SG&A line clearly. I mean, you saw the numbers. Again, we feel really good about where we're at from the top line and a gross profit perspective and we had some cost challenges that we're dealing with, but yeah.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. I just wanted to start with the inbound freight. Is that a structural thing that you kind of \u2013 or let me put it this way. Is that something you can fix structurally by increasing contracting or hauling it yourself? Or is that just something that's sort of you're stuck with and it's going to have sort of pass through as the market allows?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Look, I think we're doing everything we can to try to mitigate the impact. I think the part that's less controllable is as the overall shortage of drivers is there, the carriers are choosing what products they're going to haul and who's going to pay them the best rates to haul those products.", "From a service standpoint for us and, I think, you all know in this industry we've got to have our products available for our customers and they've got to be there when they need them. So, we've got to make sure we've got them in our facilities. So the big impact to us has been having to pay higher rates to get the products here, so we can make sure we're servicing our customers. And we're always trying to balance that. But getting the products in the facilities to be on hand for our customers is job one for us.", "So a longwinded way of saying, I think you should expect that we're doing everything we can but we're going to continue to see some challenges here as we try to impact that. It's not like we're going to pick up a lot more loads ourselves because we're not going to necessarily add the fleet to do that or move our outbound organization to handle inbound. So it really is something we've got to manage through our carrier partners.", "Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And just related to that as a follow-up, do you have any sense that \u2013 is that at all related to some of the things we've seen on the retail side of food \u2013 Walmart and Kroger have sort of \u2013 were getting shorted or they weren't happy with their logistics and tried to penalizing some of the vendors. Is this at all related to that or maybe some of the resources in the trucking world are going to make sure that's handled, or do you have any feel for that?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "It'd be hard for us to comment on whether that's driving it. I think we know what's started a lot of this was the storm activity. And we know then carriers were either being diverted to carry and handle other products that those areas of the country needed. There's been some rail issues, as I think have been well-documented that also put some additional pressure on the trucking industry. So there're probably a lots of things, but I don't know if we can comment or know anything specific to the points you made.", "Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And sort of a housekeeping and then I'll cede. For Joel, on the $200 million to $300 million range from tax reform that seems like you expect, it seems like a fairly wide range. Is that because you and your tax folks are still kind of figuring it out? Or is it more some of the discretionary things you can do with CapEx and other things?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I would say I mean probably a little bit of both. But I think \u2013 obviously, this thing is somewhat complicated and there's certainly a lot of things we're looking to do to optimize this, which would certainly impact the dollars. But I mean suffice it to say, certainly with the significance of our profits in the U.S., it's certainly going to be positive opportunity for us.", "Andrew Wolf - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marisa Sullivan with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch back on the expense outlook for the second half. You called out a number of factors that impacted your second quarter customer startup costs, fuel costs, increased investments in international. How much of those do you expect to persist into the back half of the year? And which of those would actually alleviate and help you to get that better back half performance? Thank you.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Thanks, Marisa. So I think certainly, the startup costs, we anticipate those, obviously, going away or being much less in the third quarter and beyond. The investment in the selling organization, obviously, we're going to have that with us for a while, but we look at that also is them providing growth on the top-line. So the investment there, we think, gets covered pretty quickly with some of the other top-line benefits. And then as it relates to a couple of the other things, the calendar move was a one-time thing in the European or the UK \u2013 sorry, the European business, that calendar year to fiscal year. So those are the primary things. We talked about fuel \u2013 that isn't really \u2013 the fuel rate, that will probably continue here for at least another quarter or so. But those are the primary ones, I'd say.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yes. And I think some of the other investments we talked about in Europe also. I mean, those again, those continue to be ongoing. But I mean obviously, Marisa, there's certainly things that we're doing, we're working on that also ultimately \u2013 those aren't simply the only categories or things that we're dealing with, that we're focused on here. And so again, we said a couple of times, I mean, we certainly feel good about the remainder of this year and as we head into the second half of the year, I think certainly anticipate some of that cost pressure to mitigate some.", "Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And then just quickly to follow-up on that. For the MA sales force expansion, do you expect that to continue in the second half? Or was that more just the onetime step-up in 2Q? And then was the sales force investment, was that mainly just in the number of MAs that you're hiring or you're also seeing any wage pressures in that part of your business?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Great question. So think about it as we've added the resources now, so it's somewhat of a onetime or of an acceleration. And now that they're here, obviously, the costs will continue. But we don't look to continue to accelerate that beyond necessarily those numbers at least at any significant pace. And from a wage pressure standpoint, we really aren't seeing anything new or different for our business.", "Marisa Sullivan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, and good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just circling back on the previous question. What was your productivity for the U.S. marketing associates during the quarter? And has it kind of capped out here? And should we expect it to decline slightly as you guys step-up investments in the selling organization?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Hey, Shane, so we don't necessarily talk about our share productivity metrics for our selling organization. But if your question is, are we feeling like they are continuing to be productive and grow in their productivity, the answer is yes. Obviously, the e-commerce work that we've been doing and the utilization continuing to grow is enabling that. In addition, the way we're resourcing and supporting them with this consultative model, we also feel like it's continuing to drive productivity.", "The opportunity we saw was in targeted areas where we were underdeveloped, and we felt like we had now enough inside knowledge around where we could target those resources to drive incremental growth, specifically with our local customers. So that's why you're seeing the investment we're making, but we feel really good about that organization and the progress we keep making and the leverage we're getting with them across the business.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "And then Shane, the only other thing I would add is that I mean, as we one of the great, I would say, advances we've made as an organization is the ability to actually rollout new sales associates, once they get through their training with actually larger territories than we used to have with some of the tools, some of the things that we've talked about here. There, I would say, even the newer people are more productive faster in the world we're in today. And so I think that's also a benefit.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great, I appreciate the color. And then just a question on the lower corporate tax rates, I mean do you guys think that gives you an advantage versus some of the smaller private distributors out there? I'm not sure how their taxes are, or if they're similar to yours or if they're completely different. Thanks.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Sure. So again, this is probably a little bit of me giving an opinion or speculating here. But I would say in many cases, as we've gone down the acquisition trail, we certainly have some exposure to some of the smaller distributors that are in our industry. And I would just say this. In some, not all, but in some cases, certainly, part of their goals of family-owned business is to minimize their tax that they would pay. And so, I would say that in general, our ability \u2013 again, given the amount of profitability we have in the U.S. and sort of again, just the amount of tax that we pay relative to our overall profitability, I would say that we have a good opportunity over and above, in some cases, what they may have. Again, that's a very general statement, not necessarily certainly applies to all. But I would certainly say that there's probably some opportunity there for us versus some of the \u2013 particularly, the smaller family-owned competitors.", "Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "All right, great. Thanks. That's it for me.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thank you. First, just a question on international. I mean, we've talked about the fiscal or I guess, the calendar to fiscal calendar shifts a couple of times. I'm sorry if I missed this, Joel, but did you quantify in dollars or in basis points whatever you want to do, how that hurt the second quarter and therefore how it may help the third?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "We didn't, John. We have called it out for a couple of quarters now that we're certainly looking at the fact that this quarter, we'd see a negative impact of that. That would then be somewhat picked up over the last couple of quarters but we did not quantify that.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. But that amount was not adjusted out of operating income as one of the operating income adjustments for the international segment, is that correct?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "That is correct. We did not provide any of that, no.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. Thank you just for clarifying that. And then certainly, it's interesting, and I think you touched on this a number of different places. But it is interesting that you're adding marketing associates at this point in the technological cycle. Obviously, you're putting some of the technology initiatives in the hands of the customers, allows them to order easier and allows your salespeople to focus more on selling and consulting as opposed to order-taking. Is there may be a point in your forecast, I don't know if it's 2019, 2020, 2021, whatever it is, where you expect the sales force to become much more efficient, in other words, utilizing technology themselves to the extent that they can, cover bigger territories, as you mentioned? Just want to get a sense when that you can inflect that to where we can actually start to leverage the salespeople as opposed just in incremental costs, which I think was the case in the second quarter?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "So John, let me try to take a shot at that. So again, this was what I said a couple of minutes ago around how we're thinking about this. We actually feel really good about the productivity we're getting out of our existing selling organization. You got to think about though is there's a difference between better managing the current customers and trying to acquire and drive our relative share in the marketplace through incremental business. And so I think you need to think about the two of those in conjunction. And the adding of the salespeople really on a more very targeted basis is all around trying to improve our position in certain markets where we believe we've got significant opportunities.", "And given our share position relatively in the industry, we've got plenty of room to grow and we've talked about that. And so, it's a combination of, yes, you should expect us to continue to get productive with our current selling organization with existing business. But as we look to take on new business, we do need resources in place. And those resources not only are the people but the training and the support that goes along with that. So there's \u2013 it is an investment, but one, we feel really good about and one we feel like will create a nice return for us.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. And just to reiterate, Tom said that extremely well, and I think the one thing just to reinforce, this is not \u2013 you should not take away from this that for whatever the reason there is an \u2013 productivity impacted a negative way of any of the stuff. We certainly look at this as an ability to continue to take share again in a targeted way. And so that to me is a separate and distinct from the fact that we also have some continued increases in productivity through some of the tools we've talked about. They're not mutually exclusive here in terms of adding MAs and driving productivity that they can (45:05).", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, understood. And certainly in the press release I mean I think selling expenses were called out. And so when you see that you just assume that we're just going through I guess an investment phase before we can start to get some of that full benefits and maybe that's where a lot of the questions are arising from.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "I think that's fair.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, all right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "Hey good morning. Joel, just excluding the calendar change to international and how that might affect Q3, should we be expecting the underlying business to have a better second half versus first half?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "The underlying business in international or just in general?", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "In general.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. So yes, the answer is yes. And certainly, part of in my script, I wanted to make sure I called that out. I mean we do anticipate an improvement in the second half of our year over the first half of our year. And so, I think in a number of different areas but I would certainly say the answer to that is yes, and again, we certainly tried to call that out in the script.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then just one on the modeling front for me, assuming you guys are still looking at CapEx of 1.3% to 1.4%, as a percentage of sales, that would assume or that would imply a pretty sound acceleration in the back half of this year?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. that hasn't changed. We typically experience actually a heavier amount of CapEx in the second half of our fiscal than we do in the first half. And again, our first half CapEx is very consistent with where we were in the last year. And so, we do anticipate some level of acceleration in the second half.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "Right. And then just a follow-up on that, when it comes to D&A is there any ability to help us guide with that line item since it's been moving around quite a bit?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah. No, I mean, I don't \u2013 we haven't typically guided that. I don't think there's anything really unusual to go there. I mean, just as you had modeled just our normal CapEx I would think just keep a normal view of D&A I think is reasonable. There's nothing really exciting there.", "Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, Joel, can I just clarify just from a guidance perspective? So, you're still talking about the upper end of the $600 million to $650 million, excluding Brakes. What should we be thinking about for Brakes at this point? I think at one point, you were expecting that business to be flat year-over-year. I don't know if that's still the case. I'm just trying, as we piece all this together, what should we be thinking about from Brakes in this year as we try to get ourselves to total EBIT?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. And so, what I'll tell you is we're going to give you a little \u2013 an update on that probably in our Q3 call. I would say, it's likely that will be slightly less than flat, although some of that is due to \u2013 and the reason I'm hedging in terms of the timing of this is that there were some actual tax reforms that happened in the UK and in France as well that we're still working through to be able to quantify the impact of that also factored into that number. And so again, I would anticipate that there'd be somewhat less than we guided. But again, I'd like to get a better number before I quantify that for you, we will plan to do so.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "As we think about international as a whole, is it possible for international to be flat this year? What I asked that question because EBIT was down about $40 million in the first half. And I'm just wondering how big of a ramp we should be expecting in the back half of the year with this calendar change.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yes, again, I don't want to be not responsive to your question, but we just haven't guided that number. I would just suffice it to say that again, that there will be some level of pickup in the second half of the year. But again, we haven't guided specifically of what that was like. And keeping in mind, as Tom talked about earlier, I mean, there's been somewhat of an acceleration and where we've seen opportunities that we anticipate long-term benefit from to accelerate some of the investments that we made both in the multi-temp and in some of the (49:40) as well.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Just to follow-up on the question on tax reform. As you go through the process and think about the possibility for reinvestment, can you maybe just talk about the process, what you're considering? I mean, you could probably make the argument that you've already made some reinvestment, given what we've seen on the startup side on the SG&A. But just thoughts around how much of reform, at the end of the day, you think you're going to end up keeping versus putting back into the business and how you think about that?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yes. So I think the main takeaway I'd have from that, number one, one of the things I talked about in my prepared remarks is around making investments in our business that are in line with our capital allocation priorities. And the reason I said that specifically is that we've done a lot of different questions around, will you invest in pricing, will you do some of those things? And the answer to that is that, that's not part of what we're talking about here. When we talk about investing in our business, we're talking about opportunities. Again, part of our capital allocation priority is to continue to find ways to accelerate items, to invest in assets and technologies and people and in ways that ultimately drive long-term value for this organization.", "And so, I would look at it and think about it more that way, and again certainly not \u2013 we're not thinking about as just turning around and investing that ultimately in price. And so I think \u2013 and again, as you know, our capital allocation priorities, I think, are quite balanced between investing in our business, providing value to shareholders. And I think that again, our overall investment moving forward is going to be very consistent with that.", "Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain with Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I had a question on just the currency impact. I'm guessing the currency should have helped this quarter as opposed to being a tailwind. And I don't think that's been the case for a while. So now that you have clean comparisons for Brakes year-over-year, can you confirm what the currency impact was in Q2 on a consolidated basis, or even just for international specifically? So I'm just wondering if you have any color on the relative impact from currency on revenue expenses and the earnings impact overall.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, Ajay, it's Joel. I would \u2013 on a top-line basis, it was just a little bit over 1%. We also had \u2013 there was obviously impact on the gross profit, impact on the expense. For the most part, that washed out as you translate that down to our operating income line. But we did have some benefit on the top. Again, certainly, there was somewhat \u2013 again, a little bit relative strengthening in the sterling and the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. is really what's driven that recently. But at the end of the day, again, the overall impact on the operating line is not a lot, but on top, we did get 1%.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. So really no flow through to earnings, you would say, from currency?", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah, I would say nominal amount, but nothing of what I'd consider real significance there.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay. I had one follow-up on tax reform and my question is twofold. So maybe it's a little early to talk about the consumer-related impact, but do you have any preliminary sense on whether there's been any kind of impact, like any discernible impact on restaurant spending in general in terms of what you're seeing and what you're expecting going forward? And then I was also interested in how your customers are reinvesting the tax benefit. I don't know if you've got a lot of direct visibility into that, but I'm also curious if you expect to see any benefit being ploughed back into wage adjustments by your multiunit or Broadline customers.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Well, why don't I start and I'll let Tom add his thoughts on as well. I mean \u2013 a couple of comments there. I mean, I think broadly speaking, anything that ultimately is positive for the consumer or positive for the overall economy, we certainly would view as a positive for our industry and so I'd certainly start with that.", "Yes, I think the question of, have you seen impact or what do we anticipate from a restaurant perspective, I'm sure, I think, it's varied to some extent across restaurant types. Again, one of the things I've mentioned a little bit earlier in terms of the smaller distributors, a lot of our local restaurants tend to be family-owned businesses. And so again, this is really me just opining as much as anything else. But to some extent, more family-run businesses tend to try to look at ways to minimize tax. So I'm not necessarily sure on the local level that there's going to be still that \u2013 again, in all cases, it will be different, but so much impact from that perspective and their ability to plough some of that back into the business.", "On the multiunit side, probably some extent more so. But again, I would just go back to saying in general, where there's a positive macroeconomic opportunity there, I think that certainly provide something we see positive benefit for our industry. And I don't know if there's anything else do you want to add, Tom?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Yes and you guys have probably seen some of the restaurant data, I mean, some of it was good for December. If you think about same-store sales versus \u2013 traffic continues to be a challenge in certain areas for sure, but same-store sales seemed to be growing and that's helpful. Also if you look at the relative improvement throughout the end of last year, it was stronger obviously than the first part of the year. So I think a lot of the indexes that are out there, a lot of the data that's being shared across the restaurant industry is somewhat positive during this quarter.", "And so we're hopeful that that continues, the consumer confidence that Joel is referring to and that we're all hearing about, reading about, you hope translates into increased \u2013 hopefully increased traffic but certainly increased sales in the restaurants.", "Ajay Jain - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Summers with Macquarie Securities. Your line is open.", "Bob Summers - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Good morning, everyone. I guess I want to leverage that last question a little bit and maybe ask it in a different way, which is when you look at prior instances where you \u2013 the consumers had tax relief, can you go back and look at a discernible change in trend within restaurants and your business? I mean, I think it's widely speculated on the Street that with sort of restaurant spending being high at \u2013 top of the list that you'll be a beneficiary, but empirically I'm wondering if you have any data from the last 30 years or so.", "Joel T. Grade - Sysco Corp.", "Yeah.", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "Bob, I don't think \u2013 I mean the data that's out there, we have not spent any time looking at that, it's probably something worthy of us and the industry looking at, but I can't honestly (56:51) say we've got that data in front of us. But we tend to believe a lot of the things that we're all seeing and reading. And I think that that will \u2013 we know in this business, consumer confidence, unemployment all those things are positive drivers for foodservice and for restaurants in particular. And so we're hoping that all those things do, in fact, continue to provide some nice tailwind for this industry.", "Bob Summers - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay. And then separately on the incremental hiring of salespeople, which I think as I look at advantageously or as a positive, that seems a little different than maybe you've been talking about over the last pick a timeframe. One, am I interpreting that right? And then two, I guess if it is different, what's driving the change?", "Thomas L. Ben\u00e9 - Sysco Corp.", "It's a great question Bob. And I think you are interpreting it correctly that over the last probably year-and-a-half or so I would say we are more stabilized with our selling organization. We're very focused on building out this consultative model. And so where we were maybe adding some in the past it was more around the support resources versus the actual selling resources. We're now at a place both because we have the insight and data to tell us where we should be focusing. And we've I'd say optimized might be the right word that current selling organization we felt like it was the right time to be able to start to add. So we just feel like we're in a much better position from an insight and knowledge basis and know where we have the opportunities to go ahead and start making those additions.", "Bob Summers - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Okay, great.
