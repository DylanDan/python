LLC", "Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC", "Operator", "Welcome to the Time Warner, Inc. Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. My name is Rob and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Jessica Holscott, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mrs. Holscott, you may now begin.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's Third Quarter Earnings Call. This morning we issued two press releases; one detailing our results for the third quarter and one updating our 2016 full year business outlook.", "Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, refer to certain non-GAAP measures \u2013 GAAP measures setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our Divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler, and Kevin Tsujihara, and our General Counsel, Paul Cappuccio, will join us for our Q&A session.", "Jeff?", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Jessica. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for listening in. As you know, on October 22 we announced our agreement to be acquired by AT&T for $107.50 per share of Time Warner, and that will be half in cash and half in AT&T stock. That represents a premium of more than 35% over our trading price on October 19. This transaction is an excellent outcome for our shareholders and it's an excellent opportunity to drive long-term value into the future. We believe combining with AT&T is the natural next step in the evolution of our business and it's one that allows us to significantly accelerate our most important strategy. We believe that putting these complementary businesses together will drive innovation and accelerate the transition of the ecosystem to more and better choices for consumers. We anticipate the transaction will close by the end of 2017, if not sooner.", "Turning to our results, we had another strong quarter and we remain on track to exceed our original outlook. We've delivered these results while making investments to capitalize on the growing consumption of video across both traditional and new platforms all over the world, which we're confident positions us for continued industry-leading growth over the long-term.", "In the quarter, our revenues grew 9% to $7.2 billion and adjusted operating income increased 12% to $2.1 billion, and we saw growth at all our divisions. Adjusted EPS grew to $1.83 a share and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Echoing what we've seen not only through this year but also for the past several years, our performance was propelled this quarter by creative excellence from across every one of our divisions. We're in an environment where leading brands with distinctive content that engages audiences stands apart. It's also an environment of unprecedented consumer choice and control. And as was outlined for you before, we're committed not just to being home to the world's best content, but to generating new revenue streams by leading evolution of how and where content is consumed and experienced. This is where we see enormous opportunity from joining forces with AT&T, because it brings us closer to consumers and allows us to go where they're going. And that is increasingly mobile, it's increasingly multi-platform, increasingly on demand, and it's increasingly through new services and packages via direct consumer relationships over broadband.", "As you've all heard from Randall Stephenson at AT&T, we're really focused on the growth opportunities of this combination. We think we can innovate new services and forms of content and experiences faster and better together, and that will benefit not just us, but all our business partners and consumers all over the world. If you look at our third quarter, the strength and breadth of our premium content was underscored at this year's primetime Emmy awards, where HBO, again, took home more awards than any other network for the fifteenth consecutive year. All told, across our networks and studio, Time Warner's divisions won 40 Emmys. That's more than any other company.", "More recently, we've just seen the powerful return of the D.C. entertainment-based TV slate on the CW and CNN's continued standout performance in the final stretch of the election race. And the thrilling start to HBO's newest original series, Westworld, produced by Warner Bros. More than 13 million viewers have tuned in to the premier episodes of Westworld so far and that exceeds the first episodes of Game of Thrones and True Detective.", "In film, Warner had a terrific quarter led by the latest DC installment, Suicide Squad. And Clint Eastwood's Sully. Sully is our sixth release this year to do over $100 million in domestic box.", "Now at the same time, we continue to make progress on our initiatives to develop new revenue streams outside the traditional TV ecosystem. iStreamPlanet, which Turner acquired a majority stake in last year, demonstrated that power when it used its technology to make the live streaming of the real Olympics a reality for NBC. And Turner just debuted its first direct-to-consumer offering in the U.S., FilmStruck, that's an arthouse film SVOD service.", "Over at Warners, our SVOD partnership with Tencent \u2013 Tencent video VIP continues to exhibit tremendous subscriber growth and it's currently the second-largest SVOD service in China.", "And HBO continues to make progress in its streaming strategy both here and around the world. HBO NOW is building momentum, while HBO's OTT business in the Nordics is showing accelerating growth. And we're on track to launch in more international territories before the end of the year.", "These are just early examples of the kinds of vibrant new services and capabilities we're working on, and we plan to accelerate these as part of AT&T.", "Now let me spend a little time highlighting what each of our divisions accomplished in the past quarter. At Turner, we've been investing in our leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids to make these brands even more engaging and essential to audiences. And those investments are driving real momentum across its businesses.", "During the third quarter, Turner had three of the top six ad-supported cable networks in primetime among adults 18 to 49, namely, Adult Swim, TBS and TNT. And Adult Swim was the number-one ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 34 for the 34th consecutive quarter.", "At TBS and TNT, we're very encouraged by the brand refresh that's underway and the distinctive programming that we've been rolling out. At TBS, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee has already overtaken the Daily Show in just its first season, and Sam has emerged as a distinctive voice this election, which is saying something, given some of the voices this election.", "And on Monday, we debuted People of Earth, a Warner's production, and we'll follow that with Search Party premiering November 21.", "Over at TNT, the refresh is at an earlier stage, but we're excited about Good Behavior, starring Michelle Dockery of Downton Abbey fame. And that premiers on November 15.", "And we have a very strong pipeline of originals for 2017. We also announced this quarter that TBS and TNT have reached a deal with Disney to be the cable home for the entire cannon of Star Wars movies and a similar deal with Warner Brothers for its DC theatrical titles, and that's adding to an already strong movie lineup that also includes Disney's Marvel movies and the Hunger Games franchise. This aligns perfectly with the younger audiences these brands are drawing.", "Let's all turn to CNN, which continues to win over audiences with its mixture of indispensable news and election coverage along with innovative original series.", "CNN was number-one news network among adults 18 to 49 in primetime for the fourth consecutive quarter, and CNN had its most-watched quarter in eight years among total viewers and among adults 25 to 54. And CNN's coverage of the second U.S. Presidential debate, co-hosted by our own Anderson Cooper, was its most-watched general election debate ever, making CNN one-number one among all cable networks for that night.", "And CNN Digital continued its streak as the number-one news destination, outpacing all news and information competitors with more mobile unique visitors, more multi-platform views, more video starts and more video minutes than any other news outlet.", "Let's turn to HBO, which continues to raise the bar and define the word premium for our industry. As I mentioned, its 22 primetime Emmy awards were the most of any network for the 15th consecutive year, and they included Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones, Outstanding Comedy Series for Veep, Outstanding Variety Talk Series for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. In fact, Game of Thrones received 12 awards and has now earned 38 Emmys, more than any single scripted series in television history.", "Never one to rest on its laurels, HBO is aggressively expanding its content as well. In addition to Westworld, it recently introduced Insecure, High Maintenance, Divorce and the new nightly newscast from Vice.", "What you're seeing at HBO is our ongoing strategy to provide consumers with a steady flow of the very best content in order to drive demand across both traditional distributors and with HBO NOW.", "Speaking of NOW, we remain very pleased with its progress, and in late September, we further expanded its reach with the announcement that HBO NOW along with HBO and Cinemax are now available on Sony's PlayStation platforms.", "Looking at Warner Bros. strong performance during the quarter, it underscores its global leadership position in the production of film and television, and it remains on track for another record year. Our theatrical business is setting the pace with a number of standout performers over the last few months, including the Conjuring 2, Central Intelligence, the Legend of Tarzan and Lights Out. But our blockbuster for the quarter, of course, was Suicide Squad, which not only had the biggest August opening ever but has gone on to generate nearly $750 million in worldwide box office. And that's just the most recent example of how we're tapping the growing potential of our DC entertainment IP. We've only just begun our ambitious slate for DC theatrical. Next year's much-anticipated releases include Wonder Woman and Justice League as well as Lego Batman, a fun feature that builds on the franchise we started with 2014's hit, The Lego Movie.", "We also have an unprecedented 10 television series airing this season based on DC characters, with DC's TV business now generating more than $1 billion a year in revenue, going up. And I want to highlight the excitement we're seeing for these iconic brands digitally in consumer products and even in print. Our DC Super Hero Girls partnership with Mattel has action figures flying off the shelves. And since May, DC has shipped a record 18 million comic books based on the new Rebirth series concept that was spearheaded by Geoff Johns the renowned comic book writer \u2013 he knows how to pronounce it \u2013 who's also actively helping shape our DC films.", "In the near-term, we're very excited about Fantastic Beasts, a brand-new story based in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, that we think will be a global hit, not just at the box office but in consumer products and across all platforms. Jo Rowling has already written a script for the second film that's set for release on November 16, 2018 and the third will follow in 2020. And as Jo herself recently announced, the story's so rich that she now plans to tell it in five films, giving fans even more to look forward to.", "Warner's great franchises like DC, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera are also the driving force behind our consumer products business, which is also enjoying a record year. As we continue to roll at our franchise films and develop more kids content as part of the kids venture between Warner and Turner, we think this business can be an important growth driver going forward.", "You can see we're heading into the fourth quarter with a lot of momentum and, as I said up front, we positioned ourselves to benefit from the growing opportunities we see worldwide for the best video content. We're moving aggressively to strengthen our position within the traditional ecosystem while also building new revenue streams outside of it.", "As we look at the fourth quarter of 2016 and beyond, we remain very confident about our ability to continue to execute on our plans, and we're even more excited about what we can accomplish given the combination with AT&T and what that will enable us to do as one company, uniquely focused on delivering great content and a great consumer experience across platforms.", "Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard.", "Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results, we had another great quarter with growth across all of our businesses, fueled by the positive trends we've seen throughout the year and we feel very good about how we're positioned to close out 2016 and as we head into 2017.", "In the third quarter, revenues were up 9% and adjusted operating income grew a very strong 12% to a quarterly record of $2.1 billion. Margins expanded about 100 basis points in the quarter despite continuing investments across the company in content and digital initiatives. That was partly due to limiting growth in SG&A to the low single digits. Adjusted EPS was up 46% to $1.83 and included a $0.28 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would've increased a healthy 24% to $1.55, as we benefited from great operating results, a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program.", "During the third quarter, we repurchased over $700 million of our shares and paid $315 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we've returned nearly $3.3 billion to shareholders.", "So we're very pleased with our strong operational performance so far this year, and when combined with the tax benefit, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS to $5.73 to $5.83, or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit I just mentioned. I'll touch more on our outlook throughout my presentation.", "Now turning to the segment highlights, I'll start at Turner, where our revenue trends remain robust and translated into solid double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues increased 12% in the quarter, and that included 100 basis points of FX headwinds. Domestic subscription revenues grew 15% as we continued to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle. That puts us right on track to deliver the growth for the year we've discussed with you, and we expect another year of solid double-digit growth in 2017.", "International subscription revenue was up in the low-single digits, and that included a more than five percentage point drag from FX.", "Advertising revenue was up 2%, in-line with our expectations coming into the quarter, and that included about 100 basis points of negative impact from FX. Domestic advertising increased in the low-single digits led by solid double-digit growth across our linear and digital news properties. That was somewhat balanced by the impact of our decision to air significantly less original programming at our domestic entertainment networks in part to avoid competing with the Olympics. International advertising was essentially flat in the quarter, but up high-single digits when excluding an eight percentage point FX drag.", "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be approximately flat. The scatter market remains healthy, with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up double-digits over the upfront. At the same time, we faced very difficult comparisons to last year's record Major League Baseball playoff performance and we aired three fewer playoff games this year. We'll also have fewer hours of original programming as the content refresh at TNT will accelerate more in 2017. And based on current rates, we expect FX to have a similar impact as in the third quarter.", "Moving on, content and other revenues were up 33% in the quarter. That reflects higher international licensing revenues as we're seeing healthy demand for our original programming abroad.", "Adjusted operating income was up 12% in the quarter, and margins expanded 140 basis points. That was despite higher programming costs which increased 5%, mainly reflecting CNN's election coverage.", "So Turner is executing really well and is on-track to deliver another year of strong growth in adjusted operating income. And we think the investments we're making in great content as part of the TNT and TBS rebrands as well as the new capabilities and businesses position Turner to carry this momentum into 2017 and beyond.", "Turning now to HBO, where we continue to invest in the business and lay the groundwork for accelerating revenue trends over the next few years. Consistent with the first half of the year, domestic subscription revenue grew in the mid-single digits. We continue to see a sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW as we benefit from the strong subscriber growth so far this year. On the other hand, similar to the last couple of years, we continue to experience headwinds related to subscriber mix.", "Looking ahead, we expect HBO subscription revenue growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter and in 2017. We're currently in the midst of our affiliate renewals, so the timing of when deals close and their implementation will determine the pace of the acceleration.", "Content and other revenues were down slightly in the quarter. Last year's quarter included the domestic licensing of a library series and that was mostly offset by increased international licensing revenue as the global demand for our original programming remains robust.", "Across HBO's international networks including unconsolidated JVs, revenues once again were up double-digits when excluding FX, and that primarily reflects continued positive trends in LATAM and the Nordics.", "Adjusted operating income was up 2% in the quarter, as programming cost increased mid-teens. That reflected investments in new original series like The Night Of and Vice Principals as well as the timing of theatrical availabilities.", "Overall, we're very pleased with the performance of HBO's programming lineup and excited about the strong pipeline of new series slated for the next few years, and we're confident the investments we're making in the business and the robust consumer demand for premium content around the world will contribute to significant growth in the years to come.", "Moving on to Warner Bros., where despite difficult comparisons in TV and video games, we delivered strong results with revenue up 7% and adjusted operating income increasing 12%. Warner's theatrical business led the way with revenues growing a robust 45% as we benefit from the great box office performance of our film slate. That included our most recent franchise release, Suicide Squad, which has grossed close to $750 million at the global box office. The diversity of our slate was also on display this quarter with the success of Sully, The Legend of Tarzan, and the most recent release in our very profitable horror slate, Lights Out.", "In television, we faced difficult licensing comparisons due to the syndication of 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest in last year's quarter. However, TV revenues only declined modestly as Warner's benefited from increased production with the start of the new TV season, including Warner's continued expansion in cable with shows like Westworld on HBO and Animal Kingdom on TNT.", "Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were flat in the quarter. Digital trends remain encouraging, though, with EFT revenue up 25%, and we expect improved revenue trends as our strong theatrical slate continues to move into the home entertainment window over the next few quarters.", "So Warner Bros. has great momentum and is on pace for another record year in adjusted operating income. And the initial success of this year's franchise movies gives us even more confidence in the exciting franchise-led slate we have for the next several years. So combined with the attractive growth opportunities in TV and games, Warners is well-positioned to continue delivering solid financial results over the long-term.", "Turning to the next slide, free cash flow totaled $3.3 billion through the third quarter. That's up 15% from a year ago, largely due to the growth in adjusted operating income. Year-to-date, working capital has improved due to the CME refinancing payment we received in the second quarter. So we remain on track for another year of very healthy free cash flow in 2016.", "Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $22 billion of net debt. Looking forward as we move through the approval process for the AT&T transaction, we expect to continue to pay our regular quarterly dividend. However, we have discontinued repurchasing our stock. We've done about $750 million year-to-date in M&A, largely related to the investment in Hulu in August.", "Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75 times, and we expect to end the year slightly below that target as a result of discontinuing share repurchases.", "With that, let's move onto the final slide which looks at our outlook for 2016. We're very pleased with how we're operating across the company and with our solid financial performance year-to-date, and that's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS for 2016, which we increased to $5.73 to $5.83, or $5.45 to $5.55 when excluding the $0.28 tax benefit we recognized this quarter. The midpoint of that range implies mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS, putting us on track for our eighth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth.", "Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect Warners to be the primary growth driver, led by its strong theatrical slate, including the first installment in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them franchise. Meanwhile, we continue to invest significantly in programming across our networks. HBO already premiered four new original programs in the fourth quarter, and at Turner our new NBA contract at TNT kicks in. CNN will continue to have elevated costs related to its election coverage. So we expect programming cost at both HBO and Turner to be up double digits in the fourth quarter when excluding last year's programming charges.", "In addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range and we expect that to be a sustainable level going forward.", "Overall, we have great operating momentum across our businesses and we think the investments we're making both inside and outside the traditional TV ecosystem we're very well-positioned to continue this momentum and deliver strong financial results for many years to come.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Howard. Before I turn the call over to Q&A, I wanted to add that we'd like to focus the Q&A on the third quarter results and operating performance, as there are some limits on the type of questions we can answer regarding the pending merger with AT&T.", "Operator, can you please open up the line for our first question?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes, thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session.", "Our first question today comes from the line of Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions.", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you. Good morning. I do have one merger question and then one operating question. There's some concern that an FCC review could be challenging, and so my question is do you expect ownership of any of the assets that you have broadcast licenses or your CW stake or Hulu would result in an FCC review? And do you think you, you know, would you consider divesting any assets as part of the process?", "And then I have a second question.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "All right, I'm going to pass it to Paul, our General Counsel. Go ahead, Paul.", "Paul T. Cappuccio - Time Warner, Inc.", "Hey, Mike. Thank you. As you pointed out, what the FCC does is they review and approve the transfer of licenses. We have one broadcast license, and that's for an independent local TV station that's managed not by us but by a third-party. And we have a fair number of what we would call operational licenses, many of which are not different from what any company in America has. We're currently in the process of reviewing sort of which, if any, of these licenses will need to be transferred to AT&T in connection with the transaction or which could be relinquished. And the result of that inventory will dictate what's required at the FCC. We'll say what AT&T said, which is we'll do whatever the law requires.", "But I think the point is, you know, we have a number of licenses that are essentially operational and we're looking at in fact whether those need to be transferred over to AT&T.", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "And then secondly, can you help us think a little bit, help us a little bit with the longer-term domestic affiliate growth at Turner? I mean, the 15% is very impressive. We know that you've had industry-leading growth with the renewals you've done, but can you help us with how much of that is kind of step-ups as you've moved some of the agreements to kind of market rate? And maybe how we should think about escalators and growth going forward beyond 2016? Thanks.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "John, you do it.", "John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Mike. It's John. Listen, I think we're delivering the type of results this year that we predicted a number of years ago based on the renewal cycle that we were coming up and the deals that we were successfully executing. So really pleased to be able to report subscriber revenue growth domestically in the mid-teens, which is a pretty extraordinary growth rate off of an already high base.", "And we expect to have a very strong subscriber revenue growth year next year as well, which we've highlighted and signaled, and I still think we're very, very much on-track for that.", "We haven't given any specific guidance beyond that, but I would tell you, we continue to believe that the strength of the Turner networks and our position within the ad-supported cable market is going to be able to garner fair value, and we're going to do everything we can to continue to extract fair value for the value that we think that our networks are bringing to both distributors and consumers.", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks, John.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Mike. I think we're ready for the next question, operator.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Omar Sheikh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thank you. Just got a couple; one for Jeff, one for Howard, if I could. Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you talked a lot about the creative performance of all the business units in the company. I just wonder whether you could let us know how you think you can ensure that creative culture is preserved and enhanced under AT&T's ownership, because that's I think a sort of quite a big focus for a lot of investors?", "And then secondly, Howard, on the guidance, I wondered if you could just let us know \u2013 obviously excluding the $0.28 tax benefit, since the beginning of this year, you've raised guidance by $0.15. Could you just tell us what that increase would have been if you'd excluded all the FX impacts?", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Hi. I'll start on the first one. First of all, I'm not going anywhere, and we'll be here through the closing and into quite a period of transition after that, and then Randall and I will figure out what's the best way to go over the long run.", "The same is true of our division heads and all of our top execs, so whether it's John, Kevin and Richard and all the teams they lead. And then think of our creative partners, not just our programming development execs inside the company, but all of our very, very important \u2013 most of the creative input comes from outside the company in partnership with us.", "That's the essence of Time Warner, and if you listen to Randall, and I've talked to him and all his top management for quite some time now, they are very understanding of the need to keep this company excelling and growing, and it doesn't just mean the ongoing momentum of all of our execs and the Time Warner people, it means continuing to be the leading place which we think we are at Warner, at Turner, and at HBO for creative partners outside the company who know that if you come here, we not only have a culture to make the best out of your project, but we have the resources and the distribution ability, and now with AT&T, an enhanced ability to innovate, bring them new forms and an even stronger platform to fuel all these innovations.", "You're looking at a new world of more mobile products, more short-form products, virtual reality; all kinds of exciting developments. That's why we're doing this merger, and that's why creative partners are going to find us an even more attractive place to come in the future.", "Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.", "Hey, Omar. This is Howard. So in terms of excluding FX, the $0.15 guidance increase that we've done so far this year would actually be about the same. We haven't really seen much change since the start of the year where we had estimated about a $0.15 FX impact on the year, and that's actually about where we are. So not much impact.", "Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Omar. Operator, ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "Oh, thanks so much. So for Jeff, my question is not about AT&T, but rather other companies. Were there any other companies this year that showed interest in acquiring Time Warner?", "And on HBO, any update you're willing to give us on the OTT subscriber levels in the U.S. and overseas at this point? And if not, any change in gross add momentum or churn trends? Any enhanced knowledge that you can share with us would be helpful. Thank you.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Look, I'll start with I think your question about other companies. Let's focus on AT&T. The transaction here that we're putting together, the two of us, delivers significant value and competencies going forward to our shareholders. It's a quite a unique opportunity, and it came about after numerous conversations that we had in the normal course of our business. They are our strongest distribution partner.", "We've been evolving a lot of business initiatives ourselves, and so is DirecTV and AT&T. So we basically saw that this was a fairly unique complementary way to take all the initiatives that certainly on our side we were doing, and accelerating them, and making them stronger. And we figured that together we could drive more innovation.", "And the key to having innovative things adopted is consumers finding a better value, whether that's more choice, whether it's better pricing on their packages, whether it's more effective and less intrusive advertising. That's what will determine success. We think this combination of companies is not only going to bring us that, but we think it's going to help a lot of other companies in the industry to evolve faster and bring better results to consumers.", "Richard L. Plepler - Home Box Office, Inc.", "Doug, it's Richard. On your OTT question, we couldn't be more pleased or enthusiastic about what we're seeing this year. We've seen substantial growth with HBO NOW. We expect that to continue of course across all of our digital distribution, including HBO GO.", "And I would add to that that each quarter, we're learning more and more from the data that we're getting about how to refine our market \u2013 marketing, how to improve our efficiencies, how to target better, how to affect churn, and all that is progressing month-by-month. So we're very optimistic by the numbers that we're seeing and we expect them to continue to grow.", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you, Jeff and Richard.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Doug. We're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "The next question is from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Thanks. I have one for John and one for Richard. John, first for you. Howard said growth in affiliate fees this quarter was 15%, which is better than the previous quarter. Was there anything unique about what drove this quarter? Have subs stabilized for you or gotten any better? So what made it a little bit better than second quarter growth?", "John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.", "Hi, Michael. Thanks. It's John. I mean, listen, any given quarter is going to be affected a little bit up or down based on true-ups and audit adjustments and things like that, and so I wouldn't look too closely into sequential quarterly figures.", "I mean, I think we'll guide it on an annual basis. That's how we plan for the year. And at the risk of repeating what Howard said or what I said just before, we're going to come in right about where we expected to be, which I'm really pleased with. And the subscriber trends in the United States for us in our networks are continuing to pace at about the same rate of change as they have been for a number of quarters now.", "Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay. And then for Richard, now that you've I believe got your deal done with DirecTV earlier in September, are you still confident that you're going to see high-single digit affiliate growth at HBO? And when would be the earliest point at which we will start seeing that high-single digit growth?", "Richard L. Plepler - Home Box Office, Inc.", "Yeah, Mike, first of all, we've actually completed a couple of deals with our large distributors this year, and we think they create tremendous opportunities for us, not only beginning in the fourth quarter, but into 2017 and beyond to accelerate sub revenue growth. And what's obvious about them is the acquiring company's penetration is in certain cases 50% above the acquired company's penetration, and we look forward over time to driving that not only to the acquiring company's penetration but beyond. And the joint marketing and packaging opportunities that are built into those deals, we're very comfortable are going to drive that upside for us.", "So it will begin in the fourth quarter, but begin to kick-in next year and beyond. So we're very optimistic about the deals, and we think they're going to speak volumes about sub revenue growth going forward.", "Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Michael. Ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Yes. That's coming from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thank you. My question is on Turner. You're so into your new strategy which includes a significant increase in original programming, a reduction in ad loads in some of your networks. Are you seeing the economic returns you had hoped for, or is it still too early to tell?", "And then just a follow-on. You mentioned that sub trends, you know, pace of change about the same as previous quarters, with the expected rollout of DTC now shortly, and Hulu Live sort of around the corner. Would you expect that rate of decline to accelerate in your view?", "John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.", "I'll take the second one first. The answer is no. I mean, because we're also at the very, very early stages of some new entrants coming in, the virtual folks. And so as a result of that, I \u2013 you know, we're planning for similar trends going forward, although we hope that we'll be pleasantly surprised.", "With regard to the strategy that we really started to employ a number of years ago, honestly, I couldn't be more pleased with how things are progressing, because if you look at what we've been able to do at TBS this year, which was really its rebrand year, having four of the top new comedies on cable, all of those shows being renewed for a second season, having a great show from Warner Brothers, Animal Kingdom on TNT which we've renewed for a second season, the continued dominance at Adult Swim and a significant ramp in original programming pace there, and obviously CNN is just killing it this year, and it's going to have a great year next year.", "And in terms of advertising, we're still in the very early stages of essentially nothing short of reinventing the ad model for TV. But the early, early examples that we've done, because we have done limited commercials in some of the new originals, is we are seeing some really positive results. We're seeing \u2013 because of TVs unparalleled reach and engagement, we're seeing advertiser response has been extremely positive. We're seeing improved ratings because there's less dislocation going into the advertising pod and coming out. And we've seen higher consumer satisfaction and higher brand recall. So still very early days but very, very, very encouraging and I think we're moving in the right direction, and quite pleased to see that the industry is sort of galvanizing around this idea.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Alexia. Operator, I think we're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Yes. That'll be coming from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC", "Hi. I have a couple of questions, but first just on the business side. Richard, you recently spoke at an industry conference and I think you indicated that the new AT&T DirecTV deal that you had signed enables far more flexible or unique packaging than you've had in the past. And I think you even talked about how HBO NOW could be bundled in with wireless-only bundles, and this was even before the AT&T transaction was announced. Just wondering, how do you think about those opportunities of what you've laid out in the new AT&T deal on the programming side or packaging side? And how that impacts your sub revenue growth going forward? And then I have a question on the deal for after.", "Richard L. Plepler - Home Box Office, Inc.", "Thanks, Rich. Well obviously everything I said at -- I think you're referring to the Wall Street Journal conference, holds. We're obviously very excited by the deal. We think it allows us to sell across all platforms; wireless, broadband, satellite, expands our reach into the consumer base. AT&T is very excited by the deal, and obviously when we're under one roof, we expect those opportunities to only grow and expand which, by the way, will be the case for all content providers, not just us.", "Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC", "But do you really envision them saying, hey, if you want AT&T Wireless and you're a high-end subscriber to AT&T Wireless, it's going to come bundled with HBO NOW? Like, is that what you see as the future for HBO packaging?", "Richard L. Plepler - Home Box Office, Inc.", "I think \u2013 listen, we're going to stay with the deal that we have which is turbocharging HBO across all of their platforms. They understand they have their data, we have our data, that HBO drives consumer use across all of their different platforms. That's why we did the deal together. That's why it's a good deal for them and a good deal for us. I don't think the merger has any impact on that one way or the other. And everything that they're going to do with us, I punctuate, they can do with any other content providers as well.", "Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC", "Sure. And then just a follow-up on the transaction. You mentioned that the FCC only governs license transfers. I just want it to be crystal clear that if the FCC chose to get involved and chose to deny or block those license transfers, are there ways for AT&T to continue to operate Time Warner's businesses without the license transfers? Meaning they don't block \u2013 the FCC doesn't block transactions. They simply block license transfers. So are there alternatives if the FCC tried to use the license transfer process to disrupt your transaction?", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Paul, why don't you start?", "Paul T. Cappuccio - Time Warner, Inc.", "Hey, Rich. It's Paul. You're correct to identify that the FCC reviews license transfers, is what they do. If a license transfer isn't required to AT&T, it won't be required to AT&T. And obviously, as you said, the jurisdiction of the FCC is if you need a license transfer to AT&T, and we're currently \u2013 as we said, we're currently looking at whether any of them need to be or whether they're not needed. I think the point we pointed out is there aren't like what we would call material licenses that are the bedrock of our business that AT&T would need to operate our business.", "So think of a walkie-talkie. Does AT&T need a walkie-talkie license that CNN holds in order to own CNN? Now you could think of other things like earth stations that are little more complicated in an analysis. But I think the point is, and again we don't want to get crosswise with the FCC or anything because we're looking at what's required. And we'll do what the law requires, of course. But we don't have things that are material to the actual content of the business that AT&T would need in operating our assets.", "Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Rich. Operator, we're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Yes. That will be coming from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Just back on HBO. Howard, you mentioned mix shift being a headwind this year, and Richard mentioned you've already done some renewals. I'm just trying to understand, if we continue to see mix shift, which I think is largely AT&T moving its sub base from U-verse to Direct, but feel free to correct that assumption, is there any way to think about how big that headwind is as we head into the fourth quarter? You called out acceleration, but we just saw the business decelerate. So I'm trying to understand sort of the puts and takes around those moving pieces with HBO.", "And then \u2013 at least I would expect AT&T's mix shift to continue well into next year. It's sort of in their best interest.", "And then just on Turner, John, can you talk about the NBA, the new NBA contract, both the revenue opportunities from new games \u2013 additional games, other content you got, as well as the timing of the expense increases? I'd imagine it's weighted towards the playoffs next year, but maybe just any color you can give us on sort of how that flows through would be helpful.", "Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.", "Hey, Ben. It's Howard. So in terms of the sub mix, you know, as I mentioned, we did see the headwind in the quarter. And we did see a little bit of softness at some distributors. Those recently involved in M&A have had an impact, but we don't see any material change in terms of the trend on that as we look forward.", "And we see, you know, what Richard described, some of those new deals and the fact that they'll be kicking in, that's going to have an impact that will \u2013 will exceed that as we look forward, particularly as we get into 2017.", "Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it.", "John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.", "Hey, Ben. It's John. Listen, with regards to the NBA, the fourth quarter, as I think Howard alluded to in his remarks, will be the first quarter that we'll begin to recognize the step-up in license fees. And it's one of the reasons why our programming costs will accelerate in the fourth quarter.", "Just to take a half a step back, though, we've been saying for a number of years that at Turner our goal and our full expectation is to be able to manage our overall programming cost growth to be no higher than high-single digits over a multi-year period. It's been lower than that over the last several years. Next year, principally because of the NBA rights renewal, we expect programming costs to accelerate, and will likely be double-digits. But that's not going to be a sustainable trend. They'll moderate then after that.", "And I think, yes, the way that the rights fees work, there will be a disproportionate amount recognized in the latter part of the season.", "With regard to revenue opportunities, this deal is giving us more games. We are launching a Monday Night franchise as a result of that. We have more digital rights. We're working really collaboratively with the NBA to try to dramatically accelerate the digital part of the business and digital profits as we continue to see more and more consumption happening on NBA Digital.", "So we \u2013 and by the way, just in the current environment, we're very pleased with how the season has started with what ratings look like, and inventory has been extremely tight and there's been huge demand for our NBA property. So I feel really good about advertising going into next year.", "Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Ben. I think we have time for two more questions. So operator, can you queue up the next one?", "Operator", "Yes. The next question will be coming from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.", "Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Thanks very much, and good morning. First for John or Jeff, you started down the road of addressable advertising at Turner. When you combine Turner's digital ad sales efforts with the subscriber and credit card data that AT&T has, what is that addressable advertising opportunity look like? Does that accelerate it? And how does it allow you potentially to compete with Facebook and Google in digital?", "And then a question back to HBO just around long-term investment levels. You guys talked about investing significantly in HBO, programming costs being up double-digits next quarter. Netflix is going to spend over $5 billion this year, Amazon probably over $3.5 billion. I think HBO is on-track to spend roughly $2.2 billion this year, correct me if I'm wrong. But what's the right level of programming investment for HBO over the next couple of years? Do you need to ramp that spend more quickly? And how would the merger change that trajectory, if at all?", "And then, sorry, just a quick follow-up on the merger. Maybe this is for Paul. I have a question about the reverse termination fee, the $500 million. There are some investors who think that relative to the deal value and given the regulatory risk here that the fee seems low. So I just want to understand how the Time Warner team got comfortable with that level for the fee. Thanks very much.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "A lot of questions. Paul, why don't you start with the \u2013 let me start with the regulatory fee, and Paul, you might want to add to it.", "We're focused basically \u2013 both the sides, AT&T and us, want to get this done which is going to help accelerate both our businesses. We think the combined company it's going to have the competition spurring advantages and more choice. So if you read the deal, what you should focus on is that AT&T and we who have made very significant commitments to meet the conditions necessary if there are regulatory hurdles to close the deal. That's what we're focused on. We don't think it's very important what the size of the fee is, but Paul, do you want to add anything to that?", "Paul T. Cappuccio - Time Warner, Inc.", "Well no, I think that's right. I think the importance is, is that both sides signed up to really strong efforts to get this through and are committed to it. We also believe that this is a deal that is, in our view, plainly pro-competitive. It's not a concentration of anything. It's a vertical deal where there's competition at both levels of that vertical deal so there are no possible, in our view, vertical foreclosure arguments. So we feel very good about the deal being pro-competitive. We feel very good about what we've both signed up to do to get it through. And therefore, it was of significantly less importance to us what this hypothetical fee was.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "So let me jump from that into your question on advertising and competition. And, John, you'll want to bring real facts to it. But remember what you've got as a result of this is you're going to have more competition on the subscriber offering side. You'll have more packages and more, essentially distribution alternatives for consumers, and you're already seeing some new packages and even more affordable price points that are beginning to come out of this. So that's one on the subscriber side.", "If you go to advertising, it's very important and, John, you can fill in more. But we're developing some innovative products already at Turner that focus on data analytics, targeting and return on investment for clients, so they can really value and measure what they're doing and what the results are.", "If you combine the unparalleled region engagement of television with more ability in direct platform in terms \u2013 whether it's mobile, whether it's broadband-delivered, that can really give you a step up in the efficiency of advertising and the value of advertising. That has tremendous benefits for consumers because it can shift cost from subscription payment to advertising payment. It has great benefits for advertisers because it gives them more effective advertising. And it gives them more competition in advertising. I think we've all seen, and you all know this, an increase in concentration in digital advertising in just a couple of companies. And it's basically good for the market, consumers and advertising clients, if we have a broader number of competitors in the ad business, particularly the digital ad business. So, John, you want to add any specifics on Turner?", "John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.", "No. I don't think I could add anything to that.", "Richard L. Plepler - Home Box Office, Inc.", "Anthony, it's Richard. You asked about spend. Look, what we're trying to do is we're trying to curate the best content for the best value and make it as available to as many consumers as possible in as many ways as possible. So if you look at our split, first of all, this gets obscured a lot. We have four Hollywood movies studios which make up over 70% of viewing, 68% of on-demand viewing. It's a huge part of our offering. And if you continue to look at the usage, it goes up 92% for, example of HBO subscribers watch a movie at least once a month. When you then migrate over to original programming, I've said this before, it's absolutely true, more isn't better, only better is better. We're not trying to just spend money. We're trying to spend money thoughtfully to differentiate high-quality programming and build more consumers and build more addicts (55:30) across our subscriber base.", "I like to think that our track record is pretty good at doing that over the last decade, and I think if you look out at our programming lineup going forward, you'll see that we have every confidence that we're going to continue to do that. So I like our mix, I like our investments, and I think what we're putting together in terms of a value proposition is extraordinary.", "Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Anthony. I think we have \u2013 we have time for one more question, operator.", "Operator", "Thank you. That's coming from the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.", "Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thank you. Good morning. One quick question on your Hulu stake. What happens to the Hulu stake and your carriage agreements in light of the AT&T news? And then on TV Everywhere, Jeff, you've been a proponent and a supporter of that for a long time. What happens, do you think, to TV Everywhere aspect of video distribution when virtual bundles come out and hopefully gain traction? Do you think that that sort of attempt to improve the consumer experience is behind us now, and we all are hoping for virtual bundles?", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Yeah. Let me do Hulu and then that. Thanks for the question. So on Hulu, no change. We have a passive 10% investment. We don't think the merger here changes anything. So that's generally true of all our deals with all the other distribution packages and so forth.", "On TV Everywhere, let's \u2013 if I could remember what that is, that's about more VOD and it's about better interfaces. And what we've had is we've had a kind of, I think we all know this. We've had not as fast an adoption by all the distribution platforms of full VOD offerings across all networks, good interface to find the network, easy authentication. This will help speed that up and it'll make yet another platform and interface available to all networks and therefore give a national offering for consumers increasing. I think it'll basically spur everybody, other networks, other distributors, to offer more VOD and better interfaces. And that's good for everybody.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Great. Operator...", "Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thank you. Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Great.

Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Joe, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is also being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.", "This morning, we issued 2 press releases. One detailing our results for the second quarter and the other reaffirming our 2014 full year business outlook.", "Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.", "Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Thank you. And I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. We had another great quarter. Revenues grew 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 17%, and adjusted earnings per share was up 29%.", "We also generated $2 billion in free cash flow in the first half of the year. That's up 16% from a year earlier.", "The other highlight in the quarter was the completion of the spinoff of Time Inc. into an independent publicly-traded company on June 6.", "This really marked the beginning of a new and a very promising era for Time Warner. As you know, we started a process several years ago that focused the company on video content, emphasizing the very best storytelling. We've strived to make that content available to consumers all over the world and across every technology platform and device. We've also maintained an intense focus on our operational and capital efficiency with an unwavering commitment to maximize value for Time Warner shareholders.", "Our strong results both this quarter and the last several years are evidence that our strategy is working. By focusing on the right set of leading brands and assets, on operational excellence and on disciplined capital allocation, we've been able to achieve the highest total shareholder returns of any company in our peer group over the last 6 years.", "And we think the future of the company is even brighter. We've only just begun to reap the benefits of being a nimbler and more focused video content company with iconic assets, including the world's leading premium television brand, the world's strongest ad-supported cable network group and the world's largest film and television studio. The combination of those assets and a management team that I think is the strongest in the industry, positions us for continued attractive growth in the years to come.", "Today's call is about our operating results and performance. We're not going to comment on the proposal from 21st Century Fox or its withdraw except to say that the board and our senior management team appreciate, very much, the continued support of our shareholders. We're committed to continued delivering substantial and sustainable returns into the future, and we saw ample evidence of what we can accomplish during the second quarter. And that's just the beginning.", "So let me start with HBO, which in a world with so much great content and so many ways to access that content, continues to define the word premium.", "HBO remains at the top of its game. Recently receiving 99 Primetime Emmy nominations, which is the most of any network for the 14th year in a row. It's also more than double the nominations of its closest competitor for the second straight year.", "Nominations included Outstanding Comedy Series for Veep and Silicon Valley, as well as Outstanding Drama Series for True Detective and Game of Thrones.", "Both Silicon Valley and True Detective are freshman hits for HBO. That underscores HBO's unrivaled ability to incubate and provide a platform for groundbreaking storytelling.", "Now speaking of groundbreaking, the fourth season of Game of Thrones, which concluded in June, averaged 19 million cumulative viewers, making it the most watched season of an original series in HBO's history, surpassing even The Sopranos.", "What are you going to do? With all this, HBO is not easing up on the gas. It introduced 2 more shows this quarter that are off to solid starts. John Oliver's Last Week Tonight; and our new drama, The Leftovers from showrunner and writer, Damon Lindelof.", "The Leftovers is the first show Warner Bros. has produced for HBO, and Leftovers is averaging 8 million viewers per episode to date.", "And 2 days from today, The Knick, from executive producer Steven Soderbergh, will premiere on Cinemax, which has been steadily building a slate of original hits.", "We think The Knick could be a signature show for the network, and we've already renewed it for a second season.", "I mentioned using technology to enhance the user experience. And HBO GO continues to set the standard for how audiences enjoy the content they love across devices and platforms.", "HBO GO active users grew 35% year-over-year in June and is now available in 24 territories around the world. And as we've told you before, we're making investments in the next-generation HBO GO that will be even more powerful and will put us in a strong position to take advantage of consumer demand for multiplatform viewing options here and around the world.", "HBO's investments in programming and technology continue to translate into solid subscriber growth. In the first half, we added more than twice as many domestic subs as we did in the same period a year ago and we're confident that, that will translate into even stronger subscription revenue growth over time.", "Of course, HBO's success has not been limited to its domestic business. HBO's international subscriber base, including unconsolidated joint ventures, grew almost 15% in the past 12 months. And we think there is substantial additional opportunities to grow internationally in the years to come.", "Now let's look at Turner, which has the strongest portfolio of ad-supported cable networks in the industry. That includes 2 of the top 5 networks in the U.S. and the highest percentage of its U.S. networks in the top 30 of any operator.", "And Turner's 4 most important networks, TNT, TBS, CNN and Cartoon Network accounts for 85% of its domestic affiliate fees. That concentration is the result of a deliberate strategy of focusing our investment on a small group of top-tier networks to ensure that they are must haves for both consumers and distributors.", "In a world where consumers are becoming more discriminating in what they watch and where distributors are looking to create smaller bundles of networks, we think that's the right strategy, and it puts us in a great position to increase share over time. We saw that play out in this year's [indiscernible], where we once again garnered price increases at the very top of the industry.", "To stay on top, Turner's investing even more in content, building on a strong platform that's already home to more top-rated original programs than any of its peers and a portfolio of top-tier sports that includes the NBA, Major League Baseball and March Madness.", "Those investments are paying dividends. During the quarter, TNT ranked as ad-supported cable's #1 prime time network among total viewers and adults 18 to 34, adults 18 to 49 and adults 25 to 54. We've told you about TNT's efforts to refresh and take more creative risks with its programming, and we're already seeing positive results.", "The Last Ship and Murder in the First, which both launched during the quarter, are the 2 most watched new series on ad-supported cable this year so far. We expect that momentum to continue with the August rollout of Legends, which stars Sean Bean and comes from Howard Gordon. He's the creative force behind 24 and Homeland.", "TBS was close on TNT's heels, finishing the quarter as the #3 ad-supported network in primetime among adults 18 to 49 and adults 25 to 54, with The Big Bang Theory on TBS remaining the #1 comedy on ad-supported cable among total viewers for the 10th consecutive quarter.", "And we're excited about the launch of all new episodes of American Dad on TBS this fall.", "We also continue to see strength at Adult Swim, which was, again, ad-supported cable's #1 network in total day among adults 18 to 34 during the quarter, and it won the day in adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 49 as well.", "At CNN, we're making significant progress on our original programming strategy with current seasons of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown; and Morgan Spurlock: Inside Man, both registering solid double-digit gains over the prior season.", "The Sixties was tripling CNN's time period average from a year ago and The Hunt with John Walsh, another new show, won its time period among cable news networks.", "Outside the U.S., Turner is also a leader, particularly in Latin America. The strength of Turner's international position was evident this quarter as international revenue was up around 10% and adjusted operating income grew 25% on a constant currency basis with growth across all of our major regions.", "Our kids business remains a cornerstone of our international operations. In fact, Cartoon Network is the #1 kids network in many areas outside the U.S.", "While already a very good business for us, we've got plans to significantly increase the size of our kids business as we focus on global franchise management and growing consumer products revenue.", "Turner is also investing to expand its lead in multiplatform with properties like Bleacher Report, which was the #2 stand-alone sports site in the second quarter and CNN Digital, which is significantly ahead of its peers, leading all news outlets with over 30 million monthly mobile uniques.", "CNN recently extended its multiplatform capabilities with a national rollout of its next-generation TV Everywhere product, which is now available to subscribers in over 85 million households domestically. So go check it out.", "Now I'd like to turn to Warner Bros., which is on track for another great year, underscoring its continued industry leadership. In what is widely considered a volatile and mature business, Warner has grown its adjusted operating income at a double-digit CAGR over the past 5 years by leveraging its industry-leading distribution capabilities, its unique IP and its very strong relationships in the creative community to produce content with global appeal.", "The strength and diversity of its revenue streams was evident again this quarter. On the theatrical side of the business, we anticipated a softer summer compared to last year, which remember, included Man of Steel, The Hangover Part III and The Great Gatsby.", "But despite those comparisons, we're #2 in the domestic box office year-to-date, benefiting from the strong performances of The LEGO Movie and Godzilla. And along with the release of with the second Hobbit installment, The LEGO Movie also helped us to maintain our #1 position in home video in the quarter.", "It's just the latest example of Warner's unequaled ability to create franchises with 2 additional LEGO titles already in development.", "That adds to an already strong pipeline of franchises built around DC Entertainment and the new series of films from J.K. Rowling based in the world of Harry Potter. Our franchise pipeline gives us great confidence Warner Bros. will continue to lead the film industry, building on a track record that includes the #1 position at the domestic box office 7 out of the last 10 years and the #1 spot in home video for 13 straight years.", "But that's not all. Warner Bros. Television group is also leading the industry. Heading into the 2014 to '15 TV season, Warner's is, again, the #1 producer of shows for broadcast. That's a position we've held for 11 of the past 12 seasons.", "Starting this fall, Warner will have 31 shows on broadcast networks, including at least 2 primetime series on each network and 60 shows overall across broadcast and cable.", "Now what's also really notable and unprecedented is that 5 of those shows are based on IP from DC Entertainment, including the highly anticipated Gotham on Fox, The Flash on the CW and Constantine on NBC.", "That's early evidence of Warner's ambitious plans to further mine the DC catalog across our television, film, video game and consumer products businesses.", "Warner's is also leveraging its lead skill position in broadcast television by significantly expanding production for cable networks and SVOD services, growing its non-scripted output and widening its international local production footprint.", "During the quarter, for example, we completed the acquisition of Eyeworks' international television production operations, and we've now built out a global network of wholly-owned international production companies.", "A key part of our strategy for Warner's to expand in cable TV production is working more closely with both Turner and HBO. That collaboration is one of the many benefits of having a smaller, more focused company with commonalities across all the businesses and a management team that's worked together for years. And we continue to augment our strong operating performance with disciplined capital allocation. So far, this year, we've repurchased $3.5 billion of our stock and including dividends, we've returned over $4 billion to shareholders.", "Even at recent highs, we believe share repurchases were a very attractive use of capital. And today, we announced that the board has authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases. That decision is a strong indication of the confidence we have in our growth prospects. Over the next several years, we have great opportunities across our businesses.", "At Turner, we'll benefit from our domestic affiliate renewal cycle and strong international growth while investing to reinvigorate our key brands and take advantage of under-monetized opportunities like the global kids business.", "At HBO, we'll capitalize on the growing demand for our industry-leading content both here and around the world while investing in technology to provide the very best next-generation experience to our consumers.", "At Warner Bros., we'll roll out an even stronger slate of franchise films with global appeal and leverage our leading position in broadcast TV to drive growth in cable, SVOD, unscripted and international sales.", "And across the company, we'll remain laser-focused on operating and allocating capital as efficiently as possible to maximize shareholder returns. We know that many of you are interested in hearing more about our long-term growth plans, and we look forward to sharing additional details about those plans at an investor event this fall.", "With that, let me turn it over to Howard.", "Howard M. Averill", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. As a reminder, we completed the Time Inc. spin at the beginning of June, and it's now continued in discontinued operations.", "I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. We're thrilled with our financial performance in the first half of the year. We delivered strong growth in the first quarter and even better results this one.", "So through the first half, our adjusted operating income is up 14%, and adjusted EPS is up 27%, and we think that growth is both indicative of the strength of our industry-leading businesses and the validation of the strategy we've been executing the last several years.", "In the second quarter, we posted double-digit increases and adjusted operating income at all 3 divisions and total AOI increased 17%, boosted by an acceleration in subscription revenue at both HBO and Turner.", "Margins expanded nearly 300 basis points in the quarter, and that's the 11th time in the last 12 quarters that margins have increased year-over-year.", "Total operating expenses were down 1% in the quarter, and that's despite higher content investments that Turner and HBO and increased expenses associated with the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic.", "SG&A was down 3% in the quarter. This is a great example of how our disciplined approach to expense management allows us to balance aggressive content investments with continued margin expansion and profit growth.", "We continue to leverage growth and adjusted operating income into even faster growth in adjusted EPS, which increased 29%. And that was mostly due to our ongoing share repurchase program and improved results at our equity investments, including CME.", "During the quarter, we repurchased almost $2 billion in shares, a significant acceleration from the first quarter and paid over $280 million in dividends.", "So year-to-date, we've returned over $4 billion to shareholders, including over $3.5 billion in share repurchases and well over $500 million in dividends.", "And as evidenced by the authorization of an additional $5 billion in share repurchases, we remain committed to delivering significant direct returns to shareholders.", "This morning, we also reaffirmed our 2014 guidance for low teens growth and adjusted EPS. So with a very strong first half, we remain on track for our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth and adjusted EPS.", "Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, which had record second quarter revenues and adjusted operating income.", "Subscription revenues were up 8% in the quarter despite a 70-basis point drag from FX. Domestic Subscription revenues once again grew high single-digits as Turner continue to benefit from the rate increases associated with its domestic affiliate renewals.", "International Subscription revenues increased double-digits with the largest gains coming from Latin America.", "Looking forward, we'll continue to benefit from Turner's domestic affiliate renewals for the remainder of the year, and we expect domestic sub revenue growth to remain in the high single-digit range. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to grow domestic sub revenue double-digits annually on average through 2018.", "Moving on. Advertising revenues increased 1% in the quarter, in line with the range we expected coming into the quarter, and that included the benefit of approximately 300 basis points from the airing of 2 final 4 games.", "While our new original programs at TNT are off to a good start, ratings at our domestic networks remain a headwind. In addition, scatter demand remained moderate, particularly for sports. And as we've discussed with you previously, we think that was at least partially due to the impact of the World Cup.", "Domestic advertising growth was up slightly in the quarter with very modest growth at both our domestic entertainment networks, including kids and young adults, and news networks. Excluding the drag of approximately 400 basis points from FX, international advertising would have been up in the high single-digits, led by solid underlying growth in Latin America.", "Looking ahead to the third quarter, scatter pricing is healthy, pacing up high single-digits over the upfront, however, volume remains relatively modest, and we expect ratings to remain a near-term drag on our performance.", "Taking those factors into account, we anticipate total advertising to be flat to down low single-digits in the third quarter.", "Adjusted operating income grew a really strong 15% in the quarter and margins increased over 300 basis points. That reflects both revenue growth and our continued focus on limiting non-programming expenses, which were down in the quarter.", "Programming expenses increased 5% due to higher sports cost, primarily associated with the NCAA Tournament. And that was balanced by lower original programming cost at our domestic entertainment networks due to the timing of series premieres.", "Looking ahead, we expect cost related to the new Major League Baseball deal and continued aggressive investments in original programming to result in somewhat higher programming cost growth in the second half of the year. So we expect full year programming cost growth to be in the high single-digits.", "To free up resources to invest even more in programming, as well as technology and international expansion, earlier this year, Turner kicked off a global initiative called Turner 2020.", "Turner 2020 is designed to improve efficiency and maximize performance across the organization and will likely result in restructuring charges in the second half of this year. This is all consistent with our company-wide strategy to limit non-programming expense growth in order to fund investments and drive continued margin expansion.", "Turner will also be evaluating whether to dispose of certain licensed programming in connection with these restructuring activities.", "To the extent it decides to, we could also incur programming impairments. We'll provide more details on both those fronts in the coming months.", "Excluding those potential impacts, we're on track for another year of margin expansion and solid growth at Turner. And looking beyond 2014, we expect revenue and adjusted operating income growth to accelerate over the next several years as we continue to benefit from attractive domestic affiliate rate increases, strong international growth, efficiency initiatives and upside from under monetized opportunities like our global kids business, Adult Swim and truTV.", "Turning now to HBO, where we had another very strong quarter with revenues up 17% and adjusted operating income up 23%. Subscription revenues increased 10% in the quarter with the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributing around 500 basis points to that growth.", "Domestically, our subscriber trends remain healthy, and we're starting to see some improvement in the subscriber mix, which contributed to a modest acceleration in our domestic Subscription revenue growth.", "Content revenues grew over 50% in the quarter. That increase was due to revenue from our licensing deal with Amazon, balanced by lower domestic syndication.", "Adjusted operating income was up 23% in the second quarter with margins expanding nearly 200 basis points, and that obviously benefited from the Amazon deal. Also, keep in mind that prior year's quarter benefited from an adjustment to a receivable allowance. Absent that, adjusted operating income would've been up over 30%.", "Programming expenses increased 11% with 600 basis points of that growth coming from the international consolidations. Excluding the consolidations, programming expenses increased 5% with double-digit growth and original programming, tempered by lower acquired theatrical expenses due to the timing of film availabilities. In addition, marketing spend increased to support our original programming and due to the consolidations.", "Across HBO's international properties, we've posted another quarter of solid growth. Total international revenue, including unconsolidated JVs, was up double-digits. And that was driven by continued subscriber growth with international subs up around 15% year-over-year.", "Looking ahead, we expect total expense growth, excluding the consolidations, to accelerate somewhat in the back half of the year. This is due in part to the timing of programming, the reinvestment of the Amazon proceeds and higher distribution expenses.", "As we've previously discussed, we intend to invest the majority of the Amazon proceeds back into the business in programming, marketing and technology. As a result, we expect adjusted operating income to be relatively flat year-over-year in the second half of the year. Despite that, with our strong first half results and healthy underlying trends, HBO remains on track for solid growth in 2014.", "And given the strength of its brand and content and the significant global opportunities we see in front of it, we think that HBO is poised to accelerate its growth over the next several years.", "Moving onto Warner Bros., which reached its highest second quarter profits in a decade. Despite tough theatrical comparisons, Warner's had another very strong quarter, underscoring its diverse earn extremes [ph].", "Adjusted operating income grew 28% and margins expanded around 200 basis points. That included strong growth in TV and home entertainment, combined with lower film and distribution costs.", "Adjusted operating income growth this quarter also benefited from the reversal of bad debt reserves and lower restructuring charges.", "On the TV side, revenues grew mid single-digits. That was related to higher license fees from television production and international syndication. And as Jeff described earlier, Warner's completed another very successful upfront season, so the outlook for our TV business continues to be very strong.", "Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment was up 14%, largely due to the timing of the release of the second Hobbit film and the strong performance of The LEGO Movie.", "Digital trends also remained positive with electronic sell-through up close to 70% in the quarter.", "Consumer spending across the broader home video market was down modestly in the second quarter due to the declines in rentals and sales of catalog product. However, total sell-through was up in the quarter, led by 32% growth in electronic sell-through. So we remain encouraged with the continued digital transition in home entertainment.", "Looking ahead to the second half of the year, theatrical comparisons remain challenging, but we expect continued momentum in TV. We're really well positioned for the new TV season and expect continued growth in TV license fees. We also expect demand for our content outside the U.S. to remain healthy.", "So given the strong start to the year and positive outlook in the TV business, Warner's remains on pace for another great year in 2014.", "And looking beyond 2014, we remain confident in our ability to grow both our TV and theatrical businesses at very attractive levels as global demand for high-quality video content continues to grow.", "Moving to free cash flow, where we're also having a great year. We generated nearly $2 billion in free cash flow in the first half, a 16% increase compared to last year. The year-over-year improvement is primarily due to the strong growth and adjusted operating income and a favorable swing in working capital. And that was despite increases in cash taxes, capital expenditures and cash interest.", "The improvement in working capital primarily reflects lower participations at Warner Bros. And cash taxes increased largely due to higher pretax income and the expiration of certain favorable tax legislation.", "Meanwhile, the increase in cash interest was due to higher debt balances and given the $2 billion of debt we raised during the second quarter, we expect cash interest to be higher in the second half of the year.", "So with our solid performance in the first half of the year, we're on track for another very strong year of free cash flow generation in 2014.", "Next, I want to talk about our balance sheet and capital allocation philosophy. We're strong believers that effective capital allocation can be as important to shareholder returns as strong operating performance, and we've been steadfast in our commitment to maintaining an efficient balance sheet and to prudent capital allocation in order to provide superior shareholder returns.", "That strategy has been working, and we have no intention of changing it. Our capital allocation priorities remain first and foremost to maintain a strong balance sheet so that we can fully invest to drive growth in our businesses. Even so, we generate substantial free cash flow. We have committed a significant portion of that cash flow to our dividend with the highest payout ratio in the industry. We've grown our dividend double digits each of the past 5 years and intend to continue to grow it along with our businesses.", "Next, we always look at M&A opportunities as they present themselves. Potential transactions need to provide strategic benefits with reasonable execution risk and risk-adjusted returns that are more attractive than our alternative uses of capital. But we have leading scale in our businesses, so we don't need to do anything.", "Finally, we believe share repurchases remain a very attractive use of capital and intend to continue using them to complement our dividend. You can see that philosophy at work so far this year.", "We ended the second quarter with $18.1 billion of net debt, down about $230 million from the end of 2013. That's largely due to our strong free cash flow generation, the $1.4 billion in proceeds we received from Time Inc. in connection with the spinoff, and the $1.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of our space in Time Warner Center. Our net leverage ratio was 2.5x as of June 30.", "On the M&A front, we've invested over $850 million year-to-date. The majority of this came in the second quarter as we closed our acquisition of Eyeworks' international television operations and completed financing arrangements with CME. We're optimistic about the long-term opportunities for both and they fit in perfectly with our strategy of investing selectively in attractive international territories.", "We also returned close to $3.5 billion to shareholders during the first half of the year, including almost $3 billion of share repurchases. And we believe our stock remains very attractive at current levels.", "Now onto the final slide, which shows our 2014 outlook. We had a terrific first half of the year with all of our divisions delivering strong results. And looking to the back half of the year, we expect our underlying revenue trends to remain solid, led by strong affiliate revenue growth at Turner and HBO. At the same time, we'll be making significant programming investments at both Turner and HBO, face difficult theatrical comparisons at Warner's and anticipate a negative swing in intersegment eliminations.", "So as implied by our outlook, that will cause a deceleration and adjusted EPS growth in the back half of the year.", "A few minutes ago, I mentioned that we anticipate incurring restructuring charges and programming impairments in the second half. In addition, we anticipate a favorable tax settlement over this period. While these items aren't currently reflected in our outlook, on balance, we expect they will have a net positive impact on adjusted EPS. We'll share more details on those items as the year progresses. Putting all that together, we're on track for another year of solid double-digit growth and adjusted EPS. As Jeff discussed, we're confident that we can grow adjusted EPS even faster in the years to come.", "Demand for the type of high-quality video content that we produced is only increasing, and we expect to convert that into continued healthy revenue growth. At the same time, our efficiency initiatives and strict discipline managing non-programming expenses should result in further margin expansion driving strong growth and adjusted operating income. And when you factor in our capital allocation strategy, we believe we can deliver very attractive adjusted EPS growth for the foreseeable future.", "As Jeff noted, we look forward to sharing more of our plans with you at an investor event this fall.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Howard. [Operator Instructions]", "I'll also remind you that will be not commenting on 21st Century Fox's proposal or its withdrawal.", "Joe, can you please open up the call for Q&A?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question here comes from Mr. Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "I have 2 for Jeff. Jeff, I think over the past few weeks, it was clear that you guys and the board have a strong conviction in the internal plan of Time Warner. So you've helped us in the past talk about Turner's affiliate fee growth outlook, but I wonder from where you sit as an insider, what are the drivers of Time Warner's financials do you think are underappreciated from the outside world?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Mike. Well, I'm glad you asked. Look, it's a pretty long list. So let me just tick it off. First of all, I think that global growth in multichannel TV and in connected devices is fairly strongly increasing the value of high-quality video content, and that's true all around the world. And we think that if you look at Time Warner -- HBO, Warner, Turner, all of our brands are very strong global brands. We have global scale that gives us an advantage in creating the content and also distributing the content. If you go to each company, at Turner, we've got very good visibility the next few years from the domestic affiliate renewal cycle, and so that's a pretty significant contributor to growth. We also expect to complement that with strong growth internationally, particularly in Latin America. That's true across Turner and HBO. And I think people underestimate the opportunity we have in terms of reinvigorating our key Turner networks and in capitalizing on the under-monetized opportunities that exist there. I'll just cite one, you're going to hear more about it, global kids, Turner and Warner's. HBO, we're seeing really strong increased demand for the services and the content. So both HBO subscription demand, wherever we take it; and HBO content, wherever we take that. That's true all over the world. I think people underestimate that. Warner's is also very well positioned for continued growth with both the film side -- huge pipeline of franchise films, and there are very strong secular trends in the TV series business, which Warner is the leader in producing. So I don't think that there's full appreciation of what we can do there. And this is both film and TV. And if you take just an example like DC, which is pumping out so many new shows at Warner this year, and then add to that, as you look at more and more realized power from DC, consumer products is an area, where, frankly, we've underperformed what we can do, and we think that, that's going to be a real driver going forward. So if you take all those together, we're pretty confident that we can deliver very attractive revenue growth, and we can turn that into even faster growth and adjusted OI. And of course -- and I think our record speaks to this, our approach to capital allocation, if you take increased operating income growth levels, we complement that with a fairly clear plan for capital allocation. And so we feel comfortable that we can take increased OI growth and turn it into increased EPS growth. And remember last quarter, we said publicly that we expected to deliver EPS growth in the low- to mid-teens, if not better. You probably noticed, I'm emphasizing the phrase if not better. I'd also like to note that over the years, we've consistently over-delivered, and we look forward to sharing more about that in our -- of our long-term plans in the fall.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay. Jeff, can I ask you just a quick follow-up on SVOD? There's a rumor or a report over a couple of weeks ago that Seinfeld could actually be sold into SVOD, and given the library of content you own in all the comedies, does this suggest that you and Warner's are rethinking maybe your previous positions on SVOD? Or will you be a bit more aggressive about some of your library content in comedies, especially?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, we've had a lot of SVOD rev, and I'm going to come back to that, but I think the crux of your question is that the emergence of new players is increasing the value of great content, and we have more of that than everybody. That's true on the film side; it's true on the TV series side. It was quite obvious this quarter that even without the Amazon agreement, our SVOD revenue would've been up double-digits. As we look to the full year, we expect SVOD to grow solid double-digits even without the HBO-Amazon deal. And that growth is obviously even stronger if you include the HBO-Amazon agreement. I'd like to point out, since we mentioned the HBO deal, that Amazon deal doesn't include some of HBO's most valuable content like Game of Thrones and True Detective. Now there's nothing preventing us from monetizing kids shows like those in the future if we think it makes sense, but the same thing is true for Warner Bros. We have the biggest library of TV series and films in the world. If you look at our SVOD revenue, which was quite healthy. Last year, we had a base of -- in 2013, of about $400 million. We're going to be up solid double-digits. And by that I don't mean 10 to 20, I mean more. And I think the opportunity is very, very large in international territories. So it's very clear there's big consuming [ph] amount for this content. We think there is a increasingly competitive and strong set of buyers out there, including Netflix, but including Amazon and some others. And so we're very confident we'll be able to effectively monetize our content, and we're actually pretty happy with the way we've timed or sequenced the release of our library, and you're going to be seeing more about that as the years go on.", "Operator", "Our next question here comes from John Janedis from Jefferies.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Howard, can you talk a little bit more about third quarter guidance for advertising? Now, obviously, Jeff talked about the success of some of your originals. How much of the weakness is ratings versus the ad market? And to what extent are you seeing signs of improvement in underlying demand?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Your question is third quarter advertisers?", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Yes, Jeff.", "Howard M. Averill", "Okay. So scatter pricing for entertainment nets is pacing up high single-digits over the upfront, but we're just not seeing the volume overall. And that's been true generally speaking. Additionally, the ratings at our networks do remain a drag. Internationally we're [indiscernible] to see continued drag from FX and a modest slowdown in organic growth due to a tough comp. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we think, overall, advertising is going to be flat to down low single-digits.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe on a related topic, Jeff, can you talk more ratings at Turner? Is the weakness from new or returning shows, and how much of the programming expense maybe skews to originals versus licensed relative to a few years ago?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, okay. So you got to deconstruct Turner through a different networks. Let me kind of break it down. You're asking about all of them, right? I mean, in general?", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. So let's start with TNT, which we mentioned on the call was #1 and a number of age groups in prime. TBS was basically #3 in prime. Adult swim was still #1 18 to 34. CNN is still the destination [ph] for breaking news and leader in mobile. If you really go from that in the ratings performance, it's been a little weaker in the acquired programming, not just at Turner but, really, in all basic cable networks. The originals are doing well. We mentioned on the call that the new originals we've launched this year are up 20% or more over the season -- all the originals are up 20%. So it's coming around. In 2014, we're ramping up the original programming. I think we've said this publicly. We've been around 20% of the air [ph] time original. We're heading to 40% in the next year. So we're going to still have very strong acquired programming, but it will be a smaller piece of the schedule. I think I've said on numerous calls in the past that our access to acquired programming is an advantage, even though acquired programming as a general category is going a little weaker in basically all GE cable networks.", "Operator", "Our next question here will come from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jeff, since you've taken over as CEO, you've gone through shrinking the company down and clearly, based on your prepared remarks, you see a strategic advantage in being a more nimble, focused company. Does that reflect a view that there is a disadvantage or dis-synergy in size and complexity? And I'm wondering, when you look at M&A and consolidation in the space either as a seller or a buyer, are you -- is there a general reluctance at Time Warner on the board level to sort of take on large-scale M&A because of just the view that it actually hurts the business outlook?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "No, I think you got to -- you can't make a general statement. I think we've said and I think it's pretty clear, we have leading scale in all of our businesses. So we're not subscale. We're not lacking something that we need. And the next question, it's not that it's ever a bad thing, necessarily, to add something that would bring either complementary fill-ins and maybe more scale in a given case, maybe more efficiency and elimination of redundancy. Those things are all fine. But when you're looking at any particular case, you have to look at what kind of scale are you adding? Let's take Time Warner. On the studio side, we're the biggest movie producer and distributor in the world. We're the biggest producer and distributor of series in the world. We have the biggest supply relations with the American 4 broadcast networks of anybody in the world. So if you take that and you consider combining any number of other companies that do the same thing, you'd have to ask, just on that thought, we'll get to networks, is it a good idea? Does it add operating benefits, or doesn't it? So that's on that. If you go to the network side, we've got the biggest network group. We're second to nobody in the world. And if you think -- and we've got very strong networks. If you look at the Turner networks, 4 of them are 85% of our business. Basically, the Turner networks don't have any weak sisters in the group. If you look at HBO, together with Turner, it's an extremely strong network group. If you then say, \"All right. Well, let's look at other networks around the world,\" which ones would improve the operating capabilities or the leverage or the programming capability or the distribution and marketing capability of that already strong group of networks? You can make cases depending on the hypothetical of which networks would help. You can also look at networks that aren't so strong that would not help. So you basically look at it that way. When anybody is -- and if you take a big combination, and I'm not speaking of any particular one, there are always a number of issues. There are benefits and there are risks to making any kind of combination like that. There's also the factor of business interruption, regulatory scrutiny and timings that comes into play. So I would just encourage everybody, because you're all looking at these kinds of things in more than one case, to look at all sides of the issue when you're contemplating the benefits and the risks of putting very large companies together.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "If I could just ask a follow-up. You talked about at least low to mid or better. One tool you have is the balance sheet. And maybe Howard, you'd want to comment. Like, I know it's an imperative to keep a strong balance sheet. Do you -- are you committed to investment grade? I think the answer is yes. And how high could you go and keep that kind of rating? Any comments on whether you guys would be more aggressive. And I realize you've raised it in the past?", "Howard M. Averill", "Yes. In setting our target, we've had a very consistent and very balanced approach. We've been very straightforward. First of all, we want to maintain a strong balance sheet that provides us stability to fully invest in our business. We want to make sure we do have flexibility to engage in strategic M&A that presents itself. And it's really important that we continue to have access to capital markets across whatever is happening in the economy. At the same time, we really are trying to optimize our cost of capital to drive equity returns. So as you know, we incorporate a number of factors into that analysis, including in our discussions -- on-going discussions with the rating agencies. You know we raised our leverage to 2.75x earlier this year. And that was to reflect an increased stability of our cash flow based on the timing [ph] spend. We're always evaluating these factors. But right now, we feel like 2.75x does strike the right balance among all of those.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne Agee.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I have a couple on HBO. Jeff, I wonder if you could share the feedback from HBO's distributors and their reaction to the Amazon deal. The reason I'm asking is several years ago, Starz damaged its relationship severely with distributors when it -- they were relicensing to Netflix. I was wondering what made the difference for you?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay, look. Thank you. That's a great point. I think the difference, a few years ago, what Starz did was they sold their service as a subscription service at a lower price direct undercutting their own affiliates who were their partners. It was literally the same service. The HBO deal is selling programming that's very -- classic HBO hits that are about 3 years old to Amazon where Amazon is distributing that to a lot of viewers and households that don't have HBO. So from the point of view of Amazon, it's a fantastic product offering. From the point of view of our cable and satellite and telco distributors, it's a fantastic thing because you have the resources and marketing of Amazon to a subbase that, frankly, our distributors didn't have as much penetration as they would like. So that's a great kind of partnership for our cable and sat distributors from the Amazon -- which, Amazon's a very powerful retailer. It's great to bring them into harmony with our cable and electronic distributors. Therefore, the distributors have really approved of the deal. It's actually given everybody a new enthusiasm, and particularly our underperforming affiliates, on marketing more HBO and realizing that they can do much better -- huge profit for them if they add variable subs, there's no real costs on their side. And so, what we're seeing is essentially, a regeneration of really the upside of what distributors realize they can do with HBO. Remember that one of the things that is intended [ph] to the Amazon offer, which our distributors do have, and it tends to get overlooked by everyone because it's \"not new.\" HBO's got the strongest lineup of Hollywood movies of any subscription VOD service in the world. They're current, they're new, they're powerful. That's where you get them. HBO also has a very well-recognized original programming slate that's at the top of its game. Both of those are important. And that's going to mean a big marketing push in our cable, sat, telco distributors this fall to regenerate subscriber growth all over the HBO footprint. So what you really have is Amazon and the retail industry working together with the cable, electronics, satco industry, to bring subscription premium TV in its best form to all people in the United States. You can see us doing similar things overseas. Scandinavia is the current vibrant case. And of course, HBO, with its VOD offerings in U.K., Germany, Italy, Australia, in partnership with Sky in a number of those territories, another powerful offering for consumers. I think it's really a period of tremendous upside for HBO.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "A quick follow-up. So clearly, HBO is at the very height of the creative cycle. Can you help us understand or map out what would be the sequence of events that would allow to translate that into possibly acceleration in subscription revenue in the U.S.? Is it renegotiating contracts? Or how does it work?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, thank you. It's a good question. I think what you're really saying is, what can we do to improve the mix? Because you see some vibrant HBO sub growth domestically, 2 million subs that we just reported, even stronger overseas. But on the domestic side, we're constantly working with affiliates to figure out how can be better market and position the networks among our better performing affiliates. Because some of them are up in the penetration areas that are quite inspiring for everybody. But we've given them incentives to do that. And we need to work together with them to share the economics of that. If you then go to the less penetrated affiliates who are, frankly, missing a very important net operating contribution that they should have, and it should provide sufficient incentive -- we're working hard to market with them in order to get them to be more effective in their distribution of our product. That's all part of the renewal cycle. Over the next couple of years, we're going to turn over all the deals or most of the deals at HBO. We think that we've got the right mix of incentives and consequences to drive better net performance, and I don't say that in a way that would leave out profit gains for all our affiliates, including the less performing ones, but it certainly includes increased contribution to us.", "Operator", "Our next question here comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First off, just in light of the A&E and Disney OTT linear deals, we saw A&E yesterday, curious how you think about single- and multi-stream offerings. Disney and A&E seemed to have taken pretty different approaches in terms of single versus multi and wanted your perspective on either.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Rich. Well, we're certainly open to opportunities to grow our business, and we're not philosophically opposed to an over-the-top virtual MVPD model. We've said that before. We just have to believe that it will be additive to the total situation that we've got, rather than subtract it. And so in the 2 that you mentioned, there's still a lot of questions in terms of the ad model, the quality of service, how it would impact investment in the plant. But take the DISH streaming service. It's a concept we're interested in, because of the way that it is designed very much targets incremental subs and at a price point that would be attractive to younger people, particularly. A similar one would be Comcast selling HBO on a lightweight TV package, which allows you to target a group of consumers that might otherwise not subscribe to the multichannel TV package. And that could be a great entr\u00e9e into the ecosystem for the younger consumers, who would then trade up over time. To your point on the Disney and A&E approaches, the parameters of the offering are important to make sure that it's incremental. So the number of streams, as you're, I think, asking is an important consideration. So we can't -- we're not going to set a rule on a 5-amps call about how we're doing it, but I think that the Disney approach is kind of directionally the right philosophical approach.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "Just following up on that, we believe that part of why Rupert was so interested in acquiring Time Warner was he saw this as a way to launch an everything Fox. I mean, basically, an everything Fox including Warner Bros. and Time Warner's consumer offering. Could you do the same on your own? Do you look at Turner and HBO as something that you could offer directly to consumers as a package? I guess, why or why not?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, yes we could. And let me just say what we are doing. At HBO, we're investing in top talent, including a large team of software developers in Seattle that are working on HBO. And as I think you've been among several reviewers groups have said, I think, you're right. That's a very good product. It's a very good consumer experience. So what we're doing there is we're trying to be best in class to have a platform that could not only deliver HBO networks but also Turner networks and frankly, other networks. It doesn't have to be just be ones that we own. I think it's important for everybody, in thinking about that, to ask themselves, should offerings be determined for consumers based on what a company owns? That's not how consumers would program their dial. And I think one should always look at what consumers want to do and harness those platforms that keep in mind exactly the range of products that consumers want. We think that we can have that for our HBO Turner or Warner product, but we're anticipating that people will want more than that.", "Operator", "Our next question here will come from Doug Creutz from Cowen and Company.", "Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "You guys have talked about some of the ratings challenges you faced recently, but more broadly, it seems like ratings in the second quarter were pretty weak across the board. Do you think there's anything bigger going on there? Or is this just kind of normal variability in TV viewing?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug. Well, let me note, I think you're generally right. Ratings were kind of weak across the dial -- the TV dial. Broadcast finished out 3%. Ad-supported cable was down 4%. There's some -- some did a little better, some did a lot worse. But essentially, viewing was stable but a little on the weak side across the TV dial. That, however, is before online viewing is fully captured. And it isn't really being measured. And it's not that big. But it's significant to some extent at the margin. And even though it's not being measured, a decent amount of it is being monetized. So the issue's a little overblown. If you're asking, \"Do we think there's a secular trend in lower audience viewing across the TV dial?\" we would say no.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thank, Doug, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Time Warner. Please proceed, sir.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter, and the other updating our 2011 full year business outlook.", "Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site.", "And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors.", "These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Thanks, and with that, let me turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug, and thanks for joining us this morning. This was a great quarter for us financially and strategically, led by a fantastic performance from our studio. Revenue was up 11%. That's our fastest growth rate in 4 years. Adjusted operating income climbed 18%, and adjusted EPS was up 27%. Over the last few months, we took advantage of the attractive value of our stock and increased the pace of our repurchases. We bought back $3.7 billion of our stock so far this year, more than double the pace at this time last year.", "Following the strong results this quarter, we've raised our expectations for full year adjusted EPS to growth in the high teens. That means we're on track and have doubled our earnings over the past 3 years. It's a testament to the strength of our assets and management depth that we've been able to produce these results during such an uncertain time for the economy and such a period of considerable change for our industry.", "Let me put some context around our performance this quarter, and then John will walk you through our results in detail. We believe it's clear that technology and globalization are increasing the demand for high-quality content. As the right business models develop, we believe the value of this content is growing, and we think we're positioned to be one of the chief beneficiaries of these trends.", "So to take advantage of this, we've invested and we'll continue to invest aggressively to create and acquire even more great content, and we're pushing hard to develop new business models that enhance the consumer experience in a way that supports our economics.", "We made progress toward both these goals this quarter. At Warner Bros. film division, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 grossed $1.3 billion at the box office globally, making it the third-highest grossing film ever. The 8 Harry Potter films have now grossed $7.7 billion globally, making it far and away the most successful film series in history. Of course, that's a credit to JK Rowling's brilliant story. But it also underscores Warner Bros. unequaled ability to create and manage film franchises.", "While this was the last film in the series, the Harry Potter franchise will endure in a variety of ways for a long time. As just one example, next spring, we'll open the making of Harry Potter attraction at our studio outside London, coinciding with the 2012 London Olympics. We'll give visitors a unique behind-the-scenes look at the productions on the actual sets. Advance tickets just went on sale, and they have blown away our expectations.", "Although Harry Potter overshadowed just about everything in the film world this quarter, it wasn't all about Harry at Warner Bros. Contagion and Horrible Bosses were also very strong performers, and we're set up for a strong finish to the year with the sequels to Happy Feet and Sherlock Holmes coming later this quarter.", "We're also enjoying fantastic momentum at Warner Bros. Television Production arm. The growth prospects for TV content have never been better, and Warner is in the pole position to benefit. The big story this quarter was the initial syndication of The Big Bang Theory. A hit show like Big Bang can be a tremendous asset to us across the company. For Warner Bros. it generates significant license fees and ongoing barter revenue, and for Turner, it's a critical part of the new lineup at TBS, as I'll discuss in a moment.", "Plus looking out over the next few years, our syndication pipeline is building. We've had a great start to the new broadcast network season for both our biggest returning shows like Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, Mike & Molly and for several of our new shows, especially 2 Broke Girls, Suburgatory and Person of Interest. Reflect on this list for a moment. We've never had so many successful comedies on the air at one time. For all the change in the TV business in the last decade, the holy grail of TV production is still a hit 30-minute comedy. Not only do successful comedies fetch substantial prices in syndication, they can run for multiple cycles and become multibillion dollar annuities. And we've got 4 of the top 7 on all of television.", "Over the last few weeks, we've also struck a couple of game-changing deals at The CW with both Netflix and Hulu. Historically, our stake in The CW has been profitable for us because it's a valuable platform for launching new shows. These deals substantially improve the economics of The CW. At the same time, they are great examples of how new distribution outlets can be additive to the traditional TV ecosystem. Many of the shows on The CW target a very specific demographic, and they are serialized, making them tough to syndicate through traditional networks. But they're a perfect fit for SVOD providers like Netflix and Hulu.", "In recent months, Warner has also made further progress toward improving the value proposition of owning digital movies. Its home entertainment transitions to digital distribution, we think it's critical to make it more compelling and easier for consumers to buy digital movies and to manage their collections. That's why we've been a big supporter of the UltraViolet initiative, to allow consumers to access their movies from the cloud on a wide variety of devices in and out of the home.", "And to help kickstart the process, we bought Flixster, which is the first service to allow consumers to access a UV title. Over time, we expect to see many more UV services launch. In August, we launched the beta of Flixster's collection management service, and we subsequently released the first 2 UltraViolet titles: Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern. We're really happy with the early results, and we expect UltraViolet to gain traction in the coming year as more UV titles are released and many more retail partners rollout their own UV services. In the coming months, we intend to steadily add new features to Flixster. For instance, we'll add a movie starter kit that will give consumers a choice of a complementary digital movie when they create a new UV account. We will open a studio agnostic storefront, and we'll introduce a disk to digital service that will allow consumers to convert their physical DVD collections into digital copies. We'll also keep adding new devices and platforms.", "I'll now move over to our Networks business. At Turner this quarter, we again saw strong performance from the original programming at our big entertainment networks. Most notably, Falling Skies on TNT was the #1 new show of the year, while returning shows, Rizzoli & Isles and The Closer, remain the top 2 scripted shows on Cable. We're also confident that the ratings for our acquired programming will improve as we refresh our lineup with new hit shows, the first of which is The Big Bang Theory on TBS.", "So after a great start so far, it's only been on the regular schedule for 2 weeks, but it's significantly outperforming the programming that was previously in its time slot, and that's providing a boost to other parts of the TBS schedule, including Conan. Just as important, we think Big Bang will prove to be a great platform for launching original comedies, which you'll see more of in the coming year. So not only should we see a big improvement in TBS ratings in the fourth quarter, we're also excited about the opportunity to drive growth in 2012 and beyond.", "CNN had another very strong quarter with ratings up more than 30% in its key demo, dramatically outpacing its cable news competitors again. It's further evidence that more viewers turn to CNN than anywhere else when news breaks. Importantly, we're also seeing the payoff from some of our recent lineup changes with both Anderson Cooper's AC 360 and Piers Morgan Tonight up double digits. With our coverage of the Republican primary debates already breaking audience records on CNN, we think we're really well positioned heading into the 2012 election season.", "We also benefited from strong performance at some of our faster growing network, as both truTV and Adult Swim posted their most watched third quarters ever in their key demos. As you all know, Turner's revenue is split between advertising and affiliate fees. So growing ratings is important for our ad sales effort. But to bolster our affiliate fees, it's also important to schedule high-profile programming like sports. That's why we acquired the rights to the NCAA men's basketball tournament. When we announced this NCAA deal, we told you that we expect that it would be significantly profitable for us over the life of the deal. We said that because we expected to negotiate higher affiliate fees for airing March Madness games on TNT, TBS and Turner. We're just starting that process. It should take a couple of years to complete. But recently, we successfully completed our first deals with distributors that include the values that we were seeking for this program. And we've had very constructive conversations with many of our other affiliates too, so I'm even more confident today about the profit potential of the NCAA deal than we were when we signed it.", "This quarter, we continue to make progress with our deployment of TV Everywhere at both Turner and HBO. For the past 2 years, we've been primarily focused on getting TV Everywhere up and running technically. Now we're turning to the next phase, increasing awareness and making it easy for consumers to use. Turner now has TV Everywhere versions of its networks available to 70 million U.S. households, and we expect to reach about 80 million by the end of the year.", "In addition to authenticated websites for almost all our key U.S. networks, we've now rolled out iOS apps for our CNN, Headline News, HLN, TBS, TNT, tru, Cartoon and Adult Swim. And we'll roll out versions for Android devices and several TV platforms by the end of the year.", "At HBO, we're excited by the early success of HBO GO. The mobile app has now been downloaded almost 5 million times. HBO subscribers using GO are watching substantially more HBO than they did before, and the user satisfaction is through the roof. Users are spending the vast majority of their time watching HBO's original program, which continues to set the standard for the television industry. That was evident in September when HBO won more primetime Emmys than any other network for the 10th straight year. We're continuing to launch new platforms and feature enhancements. For instance, HBO GO will be available on Roku this week and is soon to follow on the Xbox.", "In this quarter, we launched MAX GO for mobile devices. I'm also happy to report that we've made a lot of progress with the 2 major affiliates who don't yet have authentication agreements. I'm hopeful for their sake, they'll be up and running in the next few months.", "Turning to our Publishing business. Like our other divisions, Time Inc. is pushing the digital evolution of its businesses more aggressively than any other magazine publisher. It's the only publisher committed to launching tablet versions of its entire domestic portfolio, and it's the only publisher designing content specifically for each device. We'll be launching tablet versions of at least one magazine every week between now and the end of the year. Early results are very encouraging with hundreds of thousands of print subscribers authenticating across the titles we've launched so far. As I said at the outset, we had another great quarter both financially and strategically.", "Across the company, we are focused on increasing our output of high-quality content and leading the evolution of new business models that give consumers what they want in a way that's economically attractive for us. As we aim to do every quarter, we made a lot of progress on both fronts, which makes me very confident about how we're positioned for 2012 and beyond.", "I'll now turn it over to John.", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. 3/4 of the way through the year, we're really pleased with how we've executed against our goals for investment, growth and returns. Our plan involves some significant investments in the first half of the year, which we told you would result in growth being more back end weighted for 2011, and you could see this with our strong results this third quarter.", "Revenue was up double digits, and that's the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2007. And adjusted operating income was up 18% year-over-year. Now that translated to a very strong 27% growth in adjusted EPS, and we can't do it every quarter. But these results are consistent with our long-term goal of growing operating income faster than revenue, and growing earnings per share faster than operating income.", "During the quarter, we also continued to generate significant free cash flow, increasing our conversion to 60% of adjusted OIBDA. And as Jeff noted, we've increased our direct returns to shareholders. We repurchased about $1.4 billion of our shares since we last reported earnings, and we paid about $250 million in dividends during the quarter. So in light of this strong performance and confidence that it will continue through the fourth quarter, we've raised our 2011 outlook for adjusted EPS to grow in the high teens.", "Now let me move to a discussion of our segments. Let me begin with our Networks, where we saw another quarter of really good revenue growth. Advertising revenues were up 9%. Our domestic entertainment networks, including kids and young adults, grew advertising mid-single digits, and domestic news grew high single digits. That reflected strong ratings momentum at CNN and Adult Swim and as expected, softer ratings at TNT and TBS.", "International advertising grew over 30% in the quarter, helped by a couple of transactions, as well as favorable foreign exchange rates. If you look through those, international advertising revenues were up in the high single digits, which admittedly was a little lighter than we had expected. Let me provide a little bit more context as to what's happening here.", "We're continuing to see very strong performance from our Latin American operations, which have become a key growth driver internationally for us. By way of context, it's a very profitable business for us with margins closer to the levels that we have here in the U.S. And by our estimate, we are now the largest cable programmer in Latin America. We also saw solid growth in our European businesses, but it was a bit lower than we had anticipated going into the quarter. And our results have not been as strong as we'd like in India, where ratings and advertising for our largest entertainment network have been somewhat disappointing.", "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Turner is seeing similar advertising trends as it did in the third quarter. But the cancellation of NBA games should reduce growth by about 200 to 300 basis points in the quarter. We're also lapping an international acquisition that we made in the fourth quarter of last year. So we expect advertising growth on a reported basis to be in the mid-single digits.", "Now for planning purposes, we are assuming here that there will be no NBA games in the fourth quarter, and while that would have the negative impact that I just said on advertising, there will also be an offsetting reduction in programming expenses. So the impact to adjusted operating income from the lost games in the fourth quarter should be relatively immaterial.", "In terms of the scatter market, I just know generally that pricing is up high single to low double digits over the recent upfront. Moving over to Subscription revenues now for a moment in the quarter, they're up 6% year-over-year. As is often the case, there were some retroactive adjustments in the third quarter of this year, excuse me, the third quarter of both this year and last year, but together had the impact of reducing growth by about 100 basis points. As we look ahead, we expect subscription growth to be in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, and that's due to similar adjustments, as well as some headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar and recent modest declines in U.S. multi-channel subscribers.", "For all of 2011, we continue to expect underlying Subscription revenue growth to be in the high single digits at Turner and in the mid-single digits at HBO. And while the quarters can certainly bounce around from a variety of reasons, those expectations that I just communicated are consistent with what we have coming into the year.", "Adjusted operating income was down at the Networks group, 4% in the quarter, and that's largely due to 2 factors, both of which were highlighted on our second quarter earnings call. The first is programming and marketing expenses were up double digits in the quarter, and that was partly due to the timing of our sports programming, including the Major League Baseball playoffs and NASCAR. Second, recall that in last year's third quarter, we booked a $58 million reversal of a litigation reserve. That cost us 500 basis points of growth in this quarter. Please keep in mind for the full year, our programming expenses are trending pretty much exactly as we had expected. And excluding the NCAA Basketball Tournament, as well as the impact of acquisitions, we continue to anticipate programming expenses to be up mid-single digits this year.", "As we look to the fourth quarter, some of the timing issues that worked against us this quarter in the third quarter should actually turnaround and work in our favor. So we expect programming expenses to be about flat year-over-year. And again, for planning purposes here, we're assuming that there will be no NBA games played in the quarter. As a result, we expect the fourth quarter to be by far our strongest of the year at the Networks group in terms of growth and adjusted operating income.", "Now let me turn to film where Warner Bros. had its best quarter ever. Revenue was up nearly 20%, and profits more than doubled to a record of more than $0.5 billion. These strong results were principally a result of the theatrical release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 and the syndication sale of The Big Bang Theory. The incredible success of these properties underscores our view that the biggest hits are actually increasing in value, and we think the strong theatrical performance of the final Harry Potter movie bodes well for its upcoming home video release in the fourth quarter.", "The Big Bang Theory was made available for both broadcast and cable syndications starting in September and was the principal driver of the more than 20% growth in our television revenue at this division in the quarter. And given the continued strong ratings of the show on broadcast, we anticipate that it will be a strong contributor to the profitability of the studio for many years to come.", "Our Home Video revenue declined in the quarter, but that was mainly due to a lighter release slate. Our biggest title from a year ago was Clash of the Titans, and we didn't have anything of a similar large release in this year's quarter. It is worth noting, however, that for the industry, we estimate total U.S. home entertainment consumer sales were up almost 4% in the third quarter, which is an encouraging improvement from recent trends.", "We anticipate a significant improvement in Home Video revenue for us in the fourth quarter as a result of a strong slate that includes the final Harry Potter film, The Hangover Part II, Green Lantern and Horrible Bosses. The fourth quarter will also benefit from a strong slate of video games headlined by Batman: Arkham City, which has been the best reviewed game of the year and shipped almost 5 million units at launch. And we should also see a nice lift from the SVOD deal that we recently struck and announced with Netflix for CW programming. And we're looking forward to the fourth quarter theatrical releases of Happy Feet 2 and Sherlock Holmes 2: A Game of Shadows. So the fourth quarter should be another very, very strong quarter for us in terms of profits here, and we remain very confident that 2011 will be a record year for Warner Bros.", "Moving over to Publishing, where in the third quarter, Advertising revenues declined reflecting lower domestic print advertising. These results were also continuing to be negatively affected by something we've mentioned to you in the past. It's the transfer of the management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner, as well as the divestiture of titles in IPC. And if you would exclude these items, overall ad revenue was essentially flat in the quarter.", "Subscription revenues were also almost flat, and that was a result of continued softness at newsstand, particularly for the celebrity category, and that's offsetting an improvement in domestic subscriptions. Operating income declined in the quarter, and that was a function of both the modest decline in revenue and an increase in expenses resulting partly from higher paper costs.", "Looking to the fourth quarter, we do not see a significant change in top line trends. The good news is that print advertising market appears to have stabilized. Much of the softness that occurred in the third quarter happened in July in the run up to the U.S. debt ceiling deadline, and trends actually improved somewhat in August and September. So we don't anticipate seeing a further deterioration relative to the third quarter, which is good.", "We do expect Subscription revenue to remain under pressure at the newsstand due to continued softness in the celebrity category, but expenses should also benefit in the fourth quarter from a favorable comparison relative to its restructuring charge last year. So we anticipate a return to growth in adjusted operating income at Publishing in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to the next slide, which just highlights our outlook. We're very encouraged by our results for the first 9 months of the year, and our execution gives us confidence to raise our full year outlook as I mentioned earlier. We came into this year thinking that it would be a really good year, and it's been better than we expected. We're on track to grow revenue more than $2 billion this year, and we now expect high teens growth in adjusted EPS. That's particularly notable coming on the heels of about 30% growth in adjusted EPS in both 2009 and 2010.", "I think it's also important to point out that we've been able to do this even though, as what usually happens, not everything has worked perfectly this year. For instance, TBS and TNT ratings have been softer than we anticipated. Green Lantern underperformed our expectations. The home video industry has remained soft, and our largest channel entertainment network in India has struggled. And, of course, we've been operating against a relatively difficult backdrop of slowing economic growth and stagnant multichannel household formation.", "But we've been able to more than offset all of that due to strong results from CNN, Adult Swim and our sports properties, the outperformance of the rest of our theatrical slate and a great year from our Television Production unit. Broadly speaking, I think our performance is a testament to the strength and the diversity of our revenue streams, and it gives us great confidence in our growth outlook as we look beyond 2011.", "Turning to the next slide, which quickly details free cash flow. Year-to-date through the first 3 quarters, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash, with the vast majority of that coming in the third quarter. As we anticipated, conversion remains a little down compared to the year ago, year-to-date first 9 months. And that's largely a result of higher working capital requirements from planned increases in production spending at Warner Bros. and HBO. However, our conversion increased during the quarter, and we fully expect to see our rate of conversion move up next year. We've been talking about that all year.", "And the next slide, which is the last slide, provides a net debt reconciliation. We ended the quarter with about $15.3 billion in net debt. That's an increase of about $2.4 billion compared to the end of last year, and that's largely due to the continued direct returns to shareholders that we've been providing. We returned about $1.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter, and that includes over $1.1 billion in share repurchases. We also bought back another $584 million of stock subsequent to the end of the quarter. And as I noted earlier, that's an acceleration in the pace of our returns to shareholders relative to recent quarters. So year-to-date, we have returned more than $4 billion in share repurchases and dividends. And to help fund that activity while maintaining strong liquidity and balance sheet flexibility, we recently issued $1 billion in long-term debt, and we were able to do that at very, very attractive rates.", "I'd also note that year-to-date, we've spent about $300 million on M&A activity. We didn't have any significant acquisitions that occurred in the third quarter. Our leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter is about 2.3x. That's down a little bit from the second quarter, but up from around 2x at the end of 2010. Given the pace of our cash generation and share repurchases, we are on track to be closer to our target leverage of 2.5x by year end. And we continue to believe that 2.5x strikes the right balance of maintaining balance sheet strength while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. So with only one quarter left in the year, we are very pleased with our progress to date, and we are confident that we will achieve our capital plan priorities and objectives.", "Now let me end there and turn the call back over to Doug who will start the Q&A portion.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks, John. Doug, let's get the Q&A started. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a 2-part question on the studio. First, Jeff or John, given how successful Big Bang Theory was in off network syndication in the third quarter, could you remind us what the pipeline looks like for 2012 specifically? And then the second part is on UltraViolet, maybe for Jeff, how is UltraViolet going to work for Warner, Fox and Universal movies in the HBO window?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Let's start with the syndication pipeline. The Big Bang Theory is obviously a big driver this quarter, but we have a very strong pipeline coming up. We've already sold The Mentalist for 2012, happens to go into TNT. We also have Chuck currently available, and we have Fringe available in 2012. We're pretty excited about the possibilities for Mike & Molly for 2 Broke Girls among our other new shows that are currently on the air. So it's really quite good. In the longer term as we said in the kind of prepared remarks, we've got 4 of the 7 comedies on TV, which should be a really strong future in the even longer term. If you go to -- your question of how is UltraViolet working, I think, first of all, we think everyone is -- all the other studios are going to release films in that format. I think your question was about how it interacts with HBO? Would you just focus that?", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Sure, Jeff. I guess I was asking my understanding was that HBO has exclusive streaming rights in that window. So would UltraViolet movies from HBO's studio partners work in the HBO window?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, they will. HBO has been part of organizing and supporting the UltraViolet group. So yes, they will. And the method by which and the arrangements that are being made by the studios to get those rights, I'm not going to go into in detail, but it's going to work fine. And obviously, we have a big studio. We understand the value of UltraViolet to buying, owning and having owning be a good consumer attraction. But we don't think it's going to be a problem for HBO given some of the tweaks that we'll make to HBO's rights.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Barclays Capital.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "One for Jeff and one for John. First for Jeff, I just wanted to ask a little bit more about how The CW deal fits with your SVOD strategy? I know that, that content is somewhat unique. It's serialized, for a specific demo, but just want to get a little more of your thinking. Are you you becoming gradually more platform agnostic as it pertains to your studio library and would a slowdown in distribution revenue growth from your traditional affiliates or the slowdown in multi-channel videos subscribers make you more platform agnostic? And then just a quick question for John on the share buyback strategy. We're all trying to figure out how much stock to buyback in our models for 2012. Can you just give us an update on when it might be likely for you guys to consider re-upping of the authorization with the board on the share buyback plan?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We've actually always been platform agnostic on the distribution platforms, and what we've been saying all the time, all along, and the deal with Netflix and Hulu illustrate what we've been saying. Is that we always thought there was a role for Netflix and other library SVOD services in the ecosystem. It provides everyone a new way, provides us another way to monetize our concept, which is good. It gives consumers access to content they couldn't easily get before like older and serialized shows. So it can be very good for consumers because they weren't really getting those or would have trouble getting them on a VOD basis. For our studio, what that does is it monetizes some content, particularly the serialized and older series better than it was monetized before. So it adds money to the ecosystem. There's some differences because of the nature of what Netflix is and what Hulu is about how both of those work. But basically each of them is consistent and does not impinge upon the economics and value of the other kind of traditional networks. Not to get too specific, the economics of The CW and Netflix deal, The CW to Netflix deal, is basically good for both of us, just think -- have I answered your question or is there a little more dimension to what you're looking for?", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, it makes sense when you talk about it in terms of catalog content and new opportunity for monetization of catalog. I guess the question is, for more front cycle, first cycle syndication, second cycle syndication, I would assume because of your interest in preserving the ecosystem that at an equivalent price, you prefer the traditional media distributors because you want to avoid fragmentation of the advertising businesses. And so I just wonder would that change, is that changing, am I wrong about that, and so that was the nature of my question. I understand about monetizing longer-tailed catalog content.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, let's take The CW deal as a template. We'll look at each deal on a case-by-case basis. As a general matter, we would like to maximize the lifetime value of our content. It depends on the nature of the show. So for example, for a show that may have substantial value in the syndication window or even the potential for multiple cycles, think of a big hit comedy, we might not license pre-syndication at all. We might not license to SVOD at all for one of those because it be hard for an SVOD licenser to pay the money that would cover all the later cycles. But for shows that might not be a great fit for traditional buyers of syndicated programming, particularly serialized stuff, and depending on the demographic appeal, it may make sense to license those before even the traditional syndication window because the traditional syndication window for some of those shows, think of The CW shows we licensed to Hulu and to Netflix, actually fit that description. So it really depends on the nature of the programming. But there are certain kind of clearer categories into which a Netflix or a Hulu can provide added value. John?", "John K. Martin", "Just quickly on your second question, which is thoughts on the buyback. We think we've been very opportunistic this year in accelerating the pace of the buyback in light of the dislocation of the equity markets, coupled with the very, very attractive interest rate environment that the debt markets have been providing. And that's been -- we think it's been smart to sort of use this year to somewhat alter our capital structure, move it more towards optimization. And we've kept in mind the 2.5x leverage target that we've been talking about all year. I'm not going to get into the specifics as to what our plans are going to be beyond this year. I mean, we've got an existing authorization, which we still have ways to go. And then I would say we're going to be looking at the 2.5x leverage ratio and evaluating all of our alternative cost of capital against that backdrop.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I guess a question for Jeff and John as well. And sort of a light at your comments around The CW. I do have a question on the Warners library value, and it seems like it's a significant opportunity for 2012. I want to make share we have a handle on the opportunity of the short term relative to your ultimate long-term strategy. And I guess the questions, are you going to take baby steps with SVOD or a giant leap? And what I mean by that is you've got a lot of TV shows that could have outside strategic value to online distributors, sort of obvious to the list, Seinfeld, Friends and so on. And so I guess first, do you actually control the licensing for Seinfeld or is that at Sony? And then second again, as you sort of think, you sort of want to position 2012 for all of us, should we be thinking about the potential for a full library deal or is this something where we should think that you're going to take baby steps? And then for John, I'm just curious if the amortization for television programming is changing now that the online SVOD window's getting locked in. So do you expense less upfront and more later in the show, which could help TV Production profitability in the short term?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, that's 3. Okay. Seinfeld is controlled by Sony in licensing, but we work well together. On the opportunity, you're quite right about, because Warners is so big, about what we've got for online and a number of distributors: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and others. Yes, it's a big one. I don't -- we've never taken a baby step with anything. We did not recently take baby steps. We were not reticent or slow to do any of that. It was all the way we were planning to enforce and increase the value of all our programming to all our distributors, including the new SVOD-type distributors. So the recent deals are pretty big. We're happy to do big deals. We just want them to fit into the support of the other gigantic deals that we do every month with traditional networks. So there's plenty of room for us to do more deals out of our giant library of film and TV and not just from Warners, but some of our other programming that we make. If the people that want to buy it can afford it.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough, and then, John, on the amortization?", "John K. Martin", "Yes, Doug. So 2 things. The first is as it relates to the sale or well, rather as it relates to just catalog or proven shows, it's really a nonevent because the amortization on those, in many instances, has already occurred or has largely occurred. I think your question probably is going more towards as we produce new shows and sell those in, and there I think we're going to need to evaluate it as time goes on. It's probably too early to say at this point in time, there would need to be a track record of a demonstrated window where we could basically really count on the fact that it would be there, and then yes, you're right. Over time maybe we have the ability to change somewhat the recognition. But at this point, I think it's too early.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Because you haven't done a big Netflix deal yet, it's not influencing in the accounting, that's basically at this point. So no impact on 3Q. That's helpful.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We did a reasonably big Netflix deal.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, from the new Warners.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna Financial.", "Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I have one clarification and one question. How do we reconcile your expectation for HBO subscription revenue growth when Time Warner Cable says the premium revenue is down, I think they said 7%. And then, Jeff, looking at your international networks, what do you think is the structural opportunity for the run rate of revenue growth? You clearly are not growing as fast as some of your peers, for example, Discovery that reported earlier. And if you could tell us what you think the drivers of the delta are.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. First on HBO. I don't think there's a reconciliation issue. We're generally strong network growth both in programming and revenue. With any one particular distributor that may not be availing itself in that case, you mentioned a specific one, but the real upside in profitability that they should get from a network that's as successful as HBO is with every other distributors. So I think you're talking -- your question is really one for that cable distribution company not for HBO, which is doing quite well with everyone and frankly, I think we're on the -- I think that's kind of a backward-looking statement they made because we are working with them to dramatically improve their performance in premium TV. On international, I don't think I understand your question. Our international networks are growing pretty fast. And as we've said before between HBO and Turner, we think we can double the operating income over the next 3 to 4 years, and they're already making $0.5 billion. They're very different assets from what Discovery does. They're in different markets. And international news, particularly is a different animal, but that doesn't change the fact that international position, share, growth of revenue and earnings is going to be very strong for Time Warner, both at Turner and at HBO. And HBO international is growing quite rapidly.", "John K. Martin", "And remember the nature of our business, international is beyond just networks. So for example, the third quarter, our international revenues were up 29%. And as a percentage of revenues, we grew to 33% of our total, and we had huge year-over-year gains in Warner Bros., which on an absolute dollar basis, is the biggest business we have outside of the U.S. So we continue to believe that in many parts of the world, international opportunities are faster in growth than U.S. opportunities, and we intend to execute on that over time.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Two questions. First just digging in a bit deeper on your ad revenue comments for the fourth quarter. I think you said it looks similar to the third quarter. The upfront obviously starts just at a higher base. Is there some offset? Is scatter not quite as strong as it was in Q3 for you, or was it relative softness in rating? And then just second question. You obviously off to a very good start on TBS and The Big Bang Theory. Are you -- I know it's early, but are you at this point where you hope to be with that show?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, on Big Bang, we are. It's up dramatically. It's only 3 weeks in, and we think it's going to continue to build and will help the lead in to Conan. So Big Bang's doing great. On your question on this ad outlook and the scatter outlook, I'm assuming you're asking about the fourth quarter. As we said on the call, the scatter pricing is still up high single to low double digits over the upfront. In terms of volumes, we don't currently have a tremendous amount of excess inventory, which John covered in his remarks. So we're not very active in the scatter market. But still it's an open question on how much of the strength in the upfront was a result of scatter money getting pulled forward into the upfront. So the good news is the cancellations for the first quarter have been very limited. And trends in our international business are good in most territories, but we have seen some pockets of softness out there. And all of that is reflected on our expectation for mid-single digit growth in the fourth quarter.", "John K. Martin", "And that includes also the expectation of no NBA games.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Michael Nathanson from Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I have one for Jeff, and then I'll have a follow-up for John. Jeff, you talked about the NCAA and your willingness to invest near term for long-term benefit. And I wonder if you talk of the NFL and whether or not they may add some Thursday packages, maybe the Monday package, sorry the Sunday package is available. So can you talk about your interest in NFL programming, and how you would evaluate what the right near-term threshold level would be for losses whether or not you want to do something with the NFL or not.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "As you know, we've said it a lot. Sports is an important part of the offering at Turner, but we're focused on having the right sports. So TBS and TNT's model is basically built on a balance of sports, original series and acquired series, and we try to optimize, mostly we get it, the mix of those to remain attractive for viewers and advertisers and distributors and a balance of ratings, ad growth and subscriber fees. We're very happy with the performance of NBA, Major League Baseball and NCAA, and of course, you mentioned in NFL, we're going to continue to evaluate potential opportunities in the future. We look at everything, including that. But we can't really comment on exactly what we do in a case like that, other than to say, just as we did say with NCAA, and by the way, we've made tremendous progress in the affiliate deals we've been doing so far, now that NCAA has gone on schedule that we know that that's going to be quite profitable to us as we had expected. We'd only do something the size of the NFL if we were very confident we could monetize it. We would not do it, for example, as a loss leader in our projections. So that's basically how we think of things like that. That would be obviously a giant move if we made such a move.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. Maybe I put you on the spot. If you're going to monetize NCAA, do you think you can monetize the NFL?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, I'll tell you later.", "John K. Martin", "Do you have a second question, Michael?", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Yes, and then for John, just going back to, you guys gave us a lot of information about fourth quarter scatter versus upfront, but scatter versus scatter what you're saying it sounds like it's more mid-single scatter versus scatter growth based on just kind of a map of what happened here. Is that right?", "John K. Martin", "Typically, Michael, we focus as everybody knows on pricing versus the upfront. I know that many analysts for modeling purposes focus on scatter over scatter. Just a quick reminder, last year in the fourth quarter for us, we think scatter was up probably mid-teens to as much as 20%. It was really, really high. And as we said on the call right now for the fourth quarter, scatter pricing for us is up high single to low double. So -- and that's off of the strong upfront that we had, that was up low double digits. So the math suggests, to your point, that scatter on scatter is probably up modestly year-over-year.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of David Miller from Caris & Company.", "David W. Miller - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "John, 2 questions for you if I may. It used to be in the syndication business maybe 10 years ago, 15 years ago or so that the golden rule for whether or not a series was syndicated at all at least internationally was 5 years on the air or 100 episodes, whichever came first. Would you say that rule still applies as obviously, the most prolific producer out there of television series or is the industry going to sort of a model similar to kind of the Hawaii Five-0 model where episodes are sold into syndication from essentially the pilot episode right away?", "John K. Martin", "Yes, the generalization is it's getting sold essentially at the same time now. It's almost day and date. So it's changed a lot. It's been that way actually for a while.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Turns out that there are some SVOD players that will buy what is essentially syndicated run on series that don't, that they don't know, and we don't know whether they're going to have 5 years or 100 episodes in the can.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen from Merrill Lynch.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can you clarify how big the Netflix and Hulu deals are? And are they -- how spread out will they -- would you recognize it as lumpy or will it be spread out? And I just wanted to follow up on something John said earlier. You mentioned that subscribers are down domestically. I think we've obviously seen that from pay TV, but is that -- how much is it down and is it all just the market maturity or is some of it segmentation?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "You what to do the Netflix timing to recognish?", "John K. Martin", "Yes, sure. So without being overly specific, Jessica, obviously, this is a good deal for us, and it's a long-term deal. It's worth hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue to Warner Bros. TV, and it's pretty high margin. In the fourth quarter, we expect to recognize a little more than $100 million in revenue, with operating income of about half of that. And if you're thinking about next year, I would say the recognition is probably similar in terms of order of magnitude, and there's lots of mechanics as to why that's the case, but it's probably the easiest way to give you some guidance.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "On your subscriber question, Jessica, can you just I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. Would you just say it again?", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, John had mentioned when you were talking about affiliate fees that subs are down. And I'm just wondering is that because of the market maturity? I mean, the U.S. market maturity or some of the pay TV operators starting to segment with different kind of offers for different consumers or do you think it's that and do you have any sense of where we're going?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. Yes, we do. So let's break it down because that's Turner and HBO. For Turner, most of our networks are fully distributed. So any variation in subscriber volume essentially varies with multichannel sub growth. It's not an issue of that kind of less distribution or less universal distribution or any of our networks. And there's no trend problem or issue there. For HBO, basically the sub volumes are also related to multichannel sub growth because HBO is in most, pretty much all of the packages for pay TV other than the ones where our distributor is giving away free subs. So those have been pretty stable on the volume side and the HBO issue on paying subs had to do with the mix between which affiliates were above or below benchmarks. It's a little arcane. The general fact there is the revenues have been very smooth and increasing because the basic paying sub base is strong and stable and growing, and the affiliate rates abilities at both Turner and HBO are steady and strong. And at Turner, they're going to increase. At HBO, they may increase in terms of pricing.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Can I just ask one follow-up? Not to this, but just another question for Jeff. There was a great article, a recent article in The New York Times on what you're trying to do with overhead. Can you just give us a sense of how you can save and over what period of time?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "No, the Times is very exuberant about these kind of things. We think we can save what is in those article. It takes a few years to get to the run rate of those things, I'm trying to remember exactly what they wrote. What we're basically trying to do is whatever waste inefficiency and overlap that we can remove in order to take the money and put it into programming and Internet translations of our services, that's what we're doing. So it's going to take a few years to get to those run rates.", "John K. Martin", "Yes, I mean, look, if you think back what we've been doing over the last few years and if you think about the actions that we've put in place. When we came in, we cut the corporate overhead a couple of hundred million dollars. We did a soft freeze on pension plan. We standardized all of our health and welfare plans. Those cost saves alone, which are now in our results, are in the hundreds of millions of dollars already. We have been saying and we're executing against this that we've identified several areas of very, very large annual spending in the area of information technology, in the areas of real estate and facilities, and to a lesser extent, in other HR-related, back off management areas, the back office, excuse me. If you look at the aggregate spend in those areas, it's around $2 billion to $2.5 billion, and we're going to work collaboratively and establish shared services models that we think could also bring us savings in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And there was also a reference in the article to a big real estate decision that we're going to be working together as one company to make in the coming years. To put some perspective around that, we spend hundreds of millions of dollars and we occupy 10 buildings in Manhattan, and we're open to any and all options. But we're looking to act in a way where we can bring together and harness the human resources that we have in Manhattan and rationalize our footprint and do it in a very, very cost-efficient way.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of John Janedis from UBS.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can you guys talk a bit more about your programming strategy at Turner going forward? It seems like from a ratings perspective, the shelf life of some of the licensed content is compressing. So are you planning on ramping up the number of original hours in prime time or maybe even shifting some of the budget from syndication into original programming?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, possibly. I think -- let me say a few things about that. There's been a lot of speculation about the strength of acquired series on whichever cable networks have them. And basically, I think you lead off with that. If you have acquired series, they do tend to decline in a somewhat predictable way over time. One question asked, are they declining faster? No, if you look across the various networks not just ours. Secondly, what has been happening is a bit of an up-and-down supply of high-quality series, acquired series that are hits on broadcast. That could be ours. There's been a dearth of half, half hours which is about to turn around because the networks have a lot more of them on. So we think that on the acquired series side, there's a fair amount of value, and it may not go down. It may go up. As those series get scheduled with some critical mass on big reach cable networks that offer them on demand. And remember, those kind of series will not be available on demand anywhere else. So that's the kind of good news on the longevity of acquired series. If we're all sitting here saying, hey, the bids are going up and the value is going up on series programming over the lifetime, which we've all seen in these deals, then that means that the value on whichever outlet puts them on is also sustainable not declining. Having said that, we've all seen for years and both Turner and HBO have been leaders in this, that original series can be very important and very significant in terms of CPMs, branding the networks, content sale profits. And you get big hits, we've had them on HBO, we've got them now on TNT. That's very important value to the network and even content earnings for those kind of shows. So the issue gets to be one of mix, we think Time Warner is in a very advantaged place versus our competition because we make more of these hit shows, hours and half hour and sell them to all networks. We're the only series supplier coming out of Warners that has shows on all 4 broadcast networks, and we not only have a show on all of them, we have 3 shows or more on all of them. So that's a fantastic business if you think about it at the Warners side. The fact that we then have 2 big reach networks at TBS and TNT, to pick and support whichever of those become really valuable and to put them on an on-demand offering to support the TNT, TBS brands alongside of high-value sports, alongside of high-value original series, gives us a huge advantage and a tremendous platform and schedule in which to launch original series. So to finish, the obvious thing, you've seen it at HBO, you'll see it increasing at TNT, TBS is to have hit original series on those networks as well. And we'll see about how many -- if you take the balance of what acquired series are there, what originals are there, you'd like to increase the originals, and that'll probably happen unless there's so many valuable hits coming off acquired broadcast that does, it's kind of a balance between those 2 things.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "That's helpful, Jeff. And maybe one quickie is I know it's early in the season, but it seems like some of the younger skewing networks like Cartoon are seeing some rating softness. Do you think that's maybe a timing issue related to when the programming hits or maybe the beginning of a new trend where the audience is fragmenting?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "In Cartoon among the younger audience, it's a long and complicated story between Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon, and whichever program we happen to have that are hits. We have a few new promising hits and some others that have been eroding. What I would call your attention to economically because you've mentioned Cartoon, Adult Swim is a hugely successful network with rapidly increasing ratings, CPMs, ad revenues and probably affiliate fees. So don't forget that one. Don't forget truTV.", "Douglas Shapiro", "I think with that, we'll cut it off, and thank you, everybody, for listening in.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

(Operator Instructions) I will turn the conference call over to Mr. James Burtson, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Time Warner. ", "James Burtson", "Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's 2006 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Time Warner's Chairman and CEO Dick Parsons; President and COO Jeff Bewkes; and Chief Financial Officer Wayne Pace. ", "This morning we issued two press releases, the first detailing our third quarter results and the second reaffirming our 2006 full year business outlook. Before we begin, there are a number of items I need to cover with you. ", "First, we refer to non-GAAP measures, including operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA, and free cash flow. We use these measures when we analyze year-over-year comparisons. In order to enhance comparability, we eliminate certain items such as non-cash asset impairments, gains or losses from asset disposals and amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations. We call this measure adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization or adjusted OIBDA. Schedules setting our reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to operating income and cash provided by operations or the other most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our trending schedules. These reconciliations are available in today's earnings release and on our Company's website at www.TimeWarner.com/investors. A reconciliation of our expected future financial performance is also included in the business outlook release that is now available on our website. ", "Second, at the top of our earnings announcement, you will see a preamble that sets out a description of the basis of presentation for Time Warner's historical financial results described in the release. Specifically Time Warner's historical results reflect, among other items, the discontinued operations treatment of certain cable systems transferred to Comcast Corporation related to the redemption of Comcast's interests in Time Warner Cable and Time Warner Entertainment Company LP, and the exchange of cable systems with Comcast. ", "In addition, the results for the three months ended September 30, 2006 include the impact of certain cable systems acquired from Adelphia Communications Corporation and Comcast since the closing of the transactions on July 31, 2006. As such, the homes passed and subscriber information in our trending schedules have been updated for each of these transactions. For the third quarter, our results include the systems acquired from Adelphia and Comcast from the date of closing. For periods prior to the third quarter, the amounts reflect the historical Time Warner Cable systems, excluding the systems transferred to Comcast, as well as the Houston system, which Comcast will receive as part of the dissolution of our Texas/Kansas City cable partnership. ", "Also, for the third quarter, additional disclosure has been included in the notes to our earnings release that provides subscriber results for historical Time Warner Cable systems, as well as the acquired systems. ", "Third, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by the statements herein due to changes in economic, business, competitive, technological and/or regulatory factors. More detailed information about these factors may be found in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K as amended and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as amended. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ", "With that covered, I will thank you and turn the call over to Dick. ", "Dick Parsons", "Thanks, Jim and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. As you can tell from Jim's intro, we have got a lot to cover on this call this morning, particularly with the inclusion of the Adelphia/Comcast transactions in our numbers, there is a lot going on in this quarter. So before diving into the details, let me set out for you the three headlines from the quarter as I see them. ", "First, we are encouraged by the early progress AOL is making in its transition to an advertising-supported business. AOL members are indeed converting to free. We are on track to grow usage, and our monetization continues to improve. ", "Second, Time Warner Cable is generating outstanding results, even as it successfully integrates its new systems from Adelphia and Comcast. The triple play bundle continues to drive revenues up and churn down, and the addition to our footprint of what amounts to virgin territory for phone promises to accelerate our growth going forward. ", "Third, our capital allocation initiatives are delivering value to our shareholders. In particular, our share repurchase program has proven to be highly efficient, but more on that in a moment. Let me now turn to the quarter's performance. ", "I'm pleased to say Time Warner delivered strong results for the quarter. Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization, or as Jim mentioned adjusted OIBDA, grew 16%, including the impact of the cable systems acquired from Adelphia and Comcast. We again generated impressive free cash flow, converting 50% or $4 billion of our adjusted OIBDA to free cash through the first nine months of this year. In fact, we are on pace to deliver around $1.00 per share free cash flow for the full year. ", "Our adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.19, up 12% from the prior year. We achieved this growth despite the dilutive impact on EPS of the Adelphia and Comcast transactions. ", "As you saw in this morning's business outlook press release, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of low double-digit adjusted OIBDA growth. Additionally, we continue to expect to convert 35% to 45% of our adjusted OIBDA to free cash flow. ", "Looking briefly at the individual performances of our segments, the results at our film entertainment, networks and publishing segments were all strong enough to keep us on track to beat our outlook for those divisions for the full year. Wayne will have more to say about that in a moment. ", "Time Warner Cable delivered another great quarter. Our historical Time Warner Cable systems performed extremely well across all key segments. Most notably, revenue in historical systems grew 15%. Also, in historical systems our basic, digital and high-speed data subscriber net additions were all up compared to a year ago. In fact, high-speed data net additions were in excess of 200,000 for the fifth quarter in a row, and digital phone continued to make strong gains in penetration, now at 11% of all eligible homes. ", "With Time Warner Cable's continued excellent performance in its historical systems, we are focused sharply on successfully integrating our newly acquired systems. So far, this process is going very well, and we are on plan. After only a couple of months, Time Warner Cable has already begun the infrastructure upgrades. ", "Looking out into the next year, our priorities at Time Warner Cable, beyond integrating our new systems, start with continuing to drive the triple play bundle. Triple play penetration reached 9% of all customers in the third quarter. While we're pleased so far, there is significant opportunity to improve on this success, particularly when you consider that we have yet to introduce phone into the old Adelphia systems. ", "Additionally, Time Warner Cable will continue to innovate for future growth, including further developing an interactive video advertising business and beginning to roll out commercial voice and scale. ", "With respect to AOL, the early results of the strategy we announced last summer are encouraging. We are converting a significant number of AOL subscribers to free on broadband, and importantly, these members are maintaining their level of usage after they switch. In addition, we are also signing up more new users than we initially expected. Not only are former AOL subscribers coming back, a host of new first-time users are signing up. This progress is reinforcing our confidence that AOL is on track to start growing usage, meaning page views, next year. Fundamentally this is exactly what we were trying to accomplish. ", "This is especially encouraging because AOL continues to monetize its volumes very effectively. In the third quarter, AOL's advertising revenue grew a stellar 46%. For the second quarter in a row, we believe that AOL has gained share domestically, and as we look into next year, we continue to believe that AOL will grow at least in line with the domestic online advertising market. ", "Now before I ask Wayne for his normal detailed review of the quarterly results, let me update you on our capital allocations activities. I will start with our divestitures for non-core assets. Since the beginning of this year, we have announced or closed on the following list of divestitures: Time Warner Book Group, Turner South Network, our half of the Warner theme parks in Australia, our holdings in Time Warner Telecom, and AOL's Internet access businesses in France, Germany and the UK. In total, these transactions represent over $4 billion in net proceeds for Time Warner. By contrast, they represented only a little more than about $100 million in reductions in the Company's operating earnings. ", "Now lest anyone think that we are merely selling off assets, we have also expended over $20 billion on acquisitions in this year. That includes more than $14 billion to acquire the Adelphia and Comcast Cable systems, $5 billion to redeem Comcast's 21% ownership in Time Warner Cable, and about $700 million to purchase the 50% of Court TV we did not own. ", "We have also returned significant capital directly to our shareholders. So far this year, we have made over $650 million in dividend payments, and to date we have repurchased approximately $13.5 billion of our stock. In total, we bought back over 16% of our outstanding shares since we began the share repurchase program last year at an average price of $17.44 per share. We remain on track to complete at least $15 billion of our announced $20 billion program by the end of this year. ", "We believe that these capital allocation initiatives have created value for shareholders and have every confidence that we will stay aggressive, not only on the operating front but in smartly deploying our financial capacity in the year ahead. ", "Now with that, I thank you again, and I will turn it over to Wayne. ", "Wayne Pace", "Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everyone. As usual, the slides that I will refer to this morning are now available for you on our website. We will begin with an overview of our third quarter consolidated results, which you can see here on this first slide. Revenues increased 7% over the prior year quarter to $10.9 billion. Adjusted OIBDA grew 16% to $2.9 billion, and our third quarter margin increased approximately 200 basis points to 26%. These results included the impact of the Adelphia and Comcast transactions which closed on July 31. The cable systems we acquired have been accounted for as of the closing date, while the systems we transferred to Comcast, related primarily to the redemption of their interests in Time Warner Cable and Time Warner Entertainment, have been accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented. ", "Looking at earnings per share, diluted EPS before discontinued operations was $0.33 in the quarter. Included in this current quarter are $729 million in pretax investment gains related primarily to the sales of our interests in the Time Warner Telecom and Warner Brothers Australian theme parks. In addition, our third quarter earnings included a tax benefit related to the recognition of net capital loss carryforwards and an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill related to the WB Network. These and certain other items are detailed in our press release and our trending schedules for you. ", "The net impact of these items increased EPS by $0.14 in the 2006 quarter. Without these items, EPS grew 12%, as Dick mentioned, reflecting higher adjusted OIBDA and lower share count, offset in part by the expected impact of higher levels of depreciation and amortization and interest expense due to the Adelphia and Comcast transactions. ", "Moving to free cash flow, through the first nine months we generated $4 billion in free cash flow and converted a very healthy 50% of our adjusted OIBDA into free cash. This slide here shows the usual detail that we give you each quarter. ", "Moving to net debt, we ended the third quarter with net debt of just over $32 billion, an increase of approximately $16 billion from the end of last year and $10 billion since June 30. As you can see on this slide, a large portion of the increase -- about $11 billion -- is related to the Adelphia and Comcast transactions, and about $11 billion is related to our share repurchase program. These items were offset in part by the free cash flow we have generated so far this year, as well as the investment proceeds, including the sale of our stake in Time Warner Telecom of about $800 million. ", "Also, during the third quarter, Time Warner Cable paid a deposit of $182 million related to its $632 million investment in the wireless spectrum joint venture. The remaining $450 million has been funded in our current fourth quarter. In addition, we received $630 million in cash from Comcast in early October as part of the debt refinancing for the Texas/Kansas City cable partnership. We expect to complete the dissolution of the partnership as early as the end of this year, at which time we will begin to consolidate the operations of the Kansas City, the South and West Texas and New Mexico systems. The other systems, as you know and as Jim mentioned, go to Comcast. ", "As consideration for the sale of AOL's Internet access business in France, which by the way closed yesterday, we received proceeds of about $365 million. That money is in the bank. We hope to close the UK sale by the end of the year and Germany by early next year. ", "Lastly, I want to say that we are quite comfortable with how we are managing Time Warner's balance sheet. We have adhered to the parameters that we laid out for you a year ago, and we remain committed to managing a strong, healthy balance sheet going forward. ", "This next slide highlights the progress of our share repurchase program, which Dick has updated you on earlier. Dick also took you through our business outlook, so I won't spend much time here. I would like to remind you, though, that all of our outlook numbers include the impact of the Adelphia and Comcast transactions. ", "With that, we would like to spend the next few minutes on the results of each of our segments, and then we will go to Q&A. ", "We will start first with cable. As Dick mentioned, we had another very strong quarterly performance. Revenues increased 44% year over year, which included 15% growth in the historical Time Warner Cable systems. Subscription revenue benefited from the acquired systems as well as the continued growth of high-speed data, digital phone and advanced digital video services. ", "Average total monthly revenue per basic subscriber or ARPU increased 9% from the prior year to nearly $95. In the historical systems, ARPU grew a robust 13% to $98. Additionally, ARPU in the acquired systems was $82, which highlights the opportunity that we see in these systems. ", "OIBDA increased 28%, once again benefiting from the Adelphia and Comcast transactions and the growth in advanced services. Our margin for the quarter declined approximately 400 basis points to 35%. As expected, this change was due mostly to the addition of the acquired systems. Our results also include $22 million in merger-related and restructuring charges, as well as the impact of foregone management fees associated with the pending dissolution of the Texas/Kansas City cable partnership. ", "For more detail on all of this, please refer to our 10-Q which was filed earlier today, and as always, please give us a call if you have questions. ", "In addition, as Dick mentioned, we are investing across our operations to ensure the successful integration of the acquired systems. Increased expenses include new marketing programs and the hiring and training of additional CSRs. These are good things which will benefit our operations going forward. ", "Moving to subscribers, hopefully you have had a chance to see the additional disclosure we provided with the earnings release, which shows subscriber information for the acquired systems as well as the historical systems. The performance of the historical systems remain very strong. Overall in the third quarter, we added 570,000 net revenue generating units or RGUs. This comprises 583,000 from the historical systems and a decrease of 13,000 in the acquired systems. ", "Basic video subscribers increased 3,000 including a loss of 30,000 in the acquired systems. The historical systems rose 33,000 compared to the proceeding quarter, representing year-over-year growth in basic customers of 1.4%. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of basic subscriber growth in these historical systems. We added a net 136,000 digital video customers, bringing digital video customers to 7 million or 52% penetration of basic subscribers. Digital net adds in the historical systems were 143,000 up 4% from the prior quarter, while the acquired systems declined 7,000. In addition, we ended the quarter with 2.2 million DVR customers, which represented 31% of our digital customers. ", "Residential high-speed data subscribers increased 251,000. That includes 214,000 in the historical systems, and that represents the fifth consecutive quarter of more than 200,000 net additions. In total, we now have 6.4 million data customers or 25% penetration of eligible homes. ", "Lastly, we continue to be pleased with our progress with digital phone. We added 187,000 digital phone subscribers in the quarter, bringing penetration of service-ready homes to 11%. The increase in net adds was related solely to the historical systems as digital phone is not yet offered in the acquired systems. As we look out, we see plenty of digital phone growth ahead of us, particularly as we roll out the service in the acquired systems. To put our optimism in perspective, we already have four divisions where penetration is now at least 20%. ", "Looking at film, revenues were down 10%, due mostly to lower revenues from theatrical products as compared to the prior year quarter. Please remember that last year included results from Warner Brothers\u2019 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Batman Begins, as well as New Line's Wedding Crashers. This year's quarter included revenue from the strong worldwide theatrical performance of Batman Returns. ", "OIBDA decreased 14%, due primarily to the decline in revenues and offset somewhat by higher contributions from television product, as well as a benefit of approximately $10 million related to a reduction in certain legal reserves. ", "Moving to networks, revenues grew 4%. This was led by higher subscription and advertising revenues, including $60 million from the consolidation of Court TV, and was offset partly by lower content revenue at HBO, and that was due to higher syndication revenues from Sex and the City in the prior year quarter. ", "Subscription revenue increased 9% benefiting from higher rates and subscribers at Turner and at HBO, as well as $17 million from inclusion of Court TV. Ad revenue growth of 6% was driven by a 16% gain at Turner, which included $42 million or 7 percentage points of this growth from Court TV. That was offset in part by a 36% decline at the WB Network, which was related to lower primetime ratings and also the fact that the operations closed on September 17 of this year. ", "As a reminder, we are equity accounting from that date to our 50% interest in this CW Network going forward, so the results will no longer be included in the network segment but as a component of the other income line on our income statement below our reported consolidated OIBDA. ", "Adjusted OIBDA increased 9%, due largely to the increase in revenues, as well as lower marketing expenses. These items were offset partially by higher programming expenses related to Court TV and $38 million in shutdown costs at The WB. ", "One last note on networks. HBO has finalized its agreement with A&E for syndication of The Sopranos, under which it now expects to receive revenues for the first five seasons during the fourth quarter of this year. ", "Now moving on to AOL. Revenue declined 3%, due mostly to a 13% decline in subscription revenues which reflected continued subscriber losses. The decrease was offset in part by a 46% increase in advertising revenues, which benefited from solid growth across advertising run on third-party websites generated by Advertising.com, as well as display and paid search advertising. OIBDA rose 21% as lower costs and higher advertising revenues more than offset the impact from lower subscription revenues. ", "As we have previously communicated with you, we began to significantly reduce subscriber acquisition marketing during the third quarter. In fact, total marketing expenses declined $177 million compared to the prior year quarter. Our third quarter results also included $27 million of restructuring charges associated with AOL's strategic changes. We do expect to incur between $150 million and $240 million of additional restructuring charges during the fourth quarter. ", "This next slide highlights AOL's audience metrics for the third quarter. Domestic ad revenues less traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, of $304 million increased 3% sequentially from the second quarter. Third quarter unduplicated monthly domestic unique visitors averaged 112 million. Compared to the second quarter, total domestic page views declined 6% to about 49 billion, and domestic ad revenue, less TAC per 1,000 page views, increased 9% to $6.24. ", "Moving to AOL's membership base. In the third quarter, domestic AOL members declined by 2.5 million to 15.2 million. Monthly ARPU of $19.30 decreased slightly compared to the second quarter, but grew modestly over the third quarter of last year. The decline in domestic AOL members this quarter was higher compared to the second quarter for two main reasons, both of which are related to the strategy changes AOL announced on August 2. ", "First, 1.5 million members migrated to the free service, including approximately 400,000 subscribers associated with an agreement between AOL and Time Warner Cable. Second, there were around 350,000 fewer registrations in the third quarter, which reflected the lower acquisition marketing expenditures under the new strategy I mentioned a moment ago. ", "Lastly let me comment on publishing.  Revenues increased 1% compared to the prior year. Advertising revenues grew 5%. This was led by higher online revenues, as well as gains at international magazines primarily from the acquisition of Grupo Editorial Expansion, which was completed in August 2005. Also contributing to the growth were gains at People and Real Simple. OIBDA increased 3% with gains at certain international and domestic magazines, as well as lower magazine start-up losses. ", "With that, we will go back to Jim to start the Q&A part of our call.", "James Burtson", "Thanks, Wayne.  Operator, we are ready when you are. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from  Spencer Wang - Bear Stearns. ", " Spencer Wang - Bear Stearns", "Thanks and good morning. Just one quick question on cable.  The voice net adds, I think it decelerated for the second quarter in a row.  Can you just talk about what is driving that and if you have launched the in-state calling plan within the quarter, and how that impacted the sub growth?  If you could just talk about the competitive response you're seeing from the incumbent telephone companies, that would be great. Thanks.", "Jeff Bewkes", "Hi Spencer. As I think you all know, we are very happy with our success in phone so far over the last year or more, and we're ahead of the industry with 11% of eligible homes on VoIP. But of course, the next 10 points of penetration above 11% that we are at now are harder than the first 10 or 11 points.  ", "To your question, we have also seen some more aggressive marketing activity from the telcos, particularly in our case in the Carolinas. That was expected, and we are at this point lifting our performance there as well. So you definitely ask yourself, have we had a ceiling?  No, it is very clear to us that we haven\u2019t.  We have got several systems already over 20%: Albany, Syracuse, Binghamton, all heading towards 25%.  With offerings like the $99 triple play bundle which we introduced in every division in September, we don't see why we can\u2019t get there and keep moving up across our footprint.  And, as Dick said, we have not yet put it into our Adelphia and Comcast systems, or mostly our Adelphia systems.  We have really high hopes for pretty rapid progress there as we integrate those. ", " Spencer Wang - Bear Stearns", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein. ", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein ", "I want to go back to that cable question for a second.  The question we have is one of comparability.  It looks like VoIP and HSD adds in the existing Time Warner footprint are little bit lighter than we thought.  But I wonder if you can contrast the VoIP penetration in the systems you gave to Comcast versus the penetration in the systems you got from Comcast for VoIP and for HSD?  Is it a comparison issue? ", "Dick Parsons", "You are saying the penetration in which areas? ", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein ", "Basically if you look at the swaps you just went through with Comcast, you swapped some systems, we wanted to know what the VoIP and HSD penetration was in the systems you swapped versus what you got back from Comcast? ", "Jeff Bewkes", "One thing I do know right off the top of my head, the earnings margin in terms of the systems we transferred to Comcast, some of the systems we transferred had margins as high as in the 40% range, whereas the systems that we acquired from Comcast had margins under 30%;  coupled with the subs we acquired from Adelphia, which were lower than that, we basically got 4 million new subs at margins below our average. ", "Now that is really good news in terms of upside, which we will have not much difficulty bringing in.  That is what we do.  But the reason for those margins has a lot to do with the lack of penetration in advanced services in either Adelphia or Comcast.  Remember, if you just look at the basic stats for Time Warner Cable, and this is now going back to the historical part, we are the leading MSO, as I think you all know, in the deployment of every advanced service. So we have the highest penetration of digital video, high-speed data, digital phone, and we think we can extend that in Adelphia. ", "We obviously need to also improve the performance of those advanced services in the Comcast systems that we got.  So they are coming from a lower base.  Just to give you a few numbers, our basic penetration at 52% of homes, digital penetration at 52% of basic, which Comcast I don't think is at that level which reflects what happens when you take in some of their systems.  High-speed data, we are at 25% of eligible households, and phone, as we said, we are at 11%. ", "So because we have higher penetration whenever we pick up systems, in this case from Adelphia/Comcast, they are going to come in at somewhat lower performance rates, and that is part of the reason we did this acquisition. ", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein ", "Right. I guess my question to almost help your explaining this is to show what the net impact was on a sub basis for advanced services.  Because I think people look at the number and say, well, it is a bit lighter than we thought. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "I see what you are saying.  For example digital, I think you have a blended number of 136. We were up 143 in historical digital subs which is up over what we did last year.  High-speed data we had 250 total, 215 in historical systems. Phone, I don't have the phone because they don't really have it.  It is all us.  I don't know if that answers your question. ", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein ", "Well, I will tell you what.  I will go to Jim, and then I will come back.", "Wayne Pace", "Mike, I am happy to take you through the detail between them.  Because I think underneath, if that is what you're trying to get at is, what were the relative penetrations before and after? With the trending schedules, we can take you through that.  The important thing there, particularly on phone, is we are not looking out and seeing a real deceleration of net adds in front of us. ", "Dick Parsons", "Absolutely. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank. ", " Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank ", "Thank you very much. Not to beat a dead horse here on the phone side, but you mentioned the next 10 points would be more difficult than the last 10 points.  Given the financial dynamics surrounding phone have come in much more favorably than anyone expected a few years ago, have you considered moving to a more aggressive promotional price posture at some point, next year or the year following?  $79 or $89 a month offer sort of thing? ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Remember, we just started the $99 bundle.  We have some other offerings we are putting in, in phone.  If it turns out you need to do things like that, which is by no means clear at this point, we have a very superior performance and priced product as it is. I think that is not just true of Time Warner phone, but it is true of cable industry phone.  There are some dimensions to that that is going to keep the consumer phone business moving well throughout the cable industry. ", "So we say it is a little harder.  It is just obvious that it is easier to get the first 10 points than the next 10 points.  We don't see a problem with it.  We have done it in other systems, and we have got, as we have said, we're repeating ourselves, but we have got a lot of phone territory that we just picked up that is going to be the easy first 10 points. ", " Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank ", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch. ", " Jessica Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch ", "Thanks.  I will switch gears at this point and just ask a couple of quick questions. Can you comment on the cable networks go to market for the fourth quarter?  Can you comment on the magazine sales, what the interest level is and the timing? And then finally, you said that you expect AOL advertising to grow next year in line with the market.  Can you quantify the range you expect the market to grow? ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Let me go in the order you asked.  The scatter market is good and picking up in terms of being higher. Let's say it is about mid to high single-digits above the --  call it mid single-digits -- above the upfront market. As you remember, at Turner we did better in the upfront, when we were basically the lead price and ad revenue performer in the upfront against all the other cable networks. ", "As we said in this release, Turner's ad revenue is up 9% without Court TV, 16% with.  So we think we are going to low to mid single-digit price increases over the upfront to finish the scatter market.  So that was your network question. ", "Dick Parsons", "On magazines, Jessica, yes, there is an awful lot of interest, actually.  I think the initial indication was from over 70 different potential buyers.  We are second round now, and we are down to somewhere in the eight to ten. There is plenty of interest, but it is too early to call how the game is going to end.  But we're confident that we will have a successful transaction there. ", "Your last one I guess was on what we expect ad growth to be in the online space next year, right? ", " Jessica Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch ", "Right. ", "Dick Parsons", "The reason we articulate it the way we articulate it and said that we will be at least on the market is I have seen estimates all over the place anywhere from high-teens to the mid-30s. I think it is going to be robust, and I think we have taken domestic share, at least, in the last two quarters.  We see at the rate that AOL is monetizing these eyeballs, with usage starting to grow, we don't see any abatement on that front. So whatever it turns out to be within that range, I think we will be on it or above it. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Let me add to it and give some context for AOL.  Because as Wayne and Dick reported, the ad revenues were up 46% year over year.  We were up 6% sequentially after a 40% ad growth and revenue gain in the second quarter. It is important to look at some of the pieces of that.  Monetization is part of this, and our revenue per thousand grew 60% year-over-year to $6.24, it was up from $3.85 last year, and it puts us solidly in the ranks of our two closest competitors. ", "Put the ad revenue in the context of the total AOL plan.  As we said on August 2, we were very happy and encouraged with what is happening.  Our main goal is to maximize users for AOL, whether they are registered free users or whether they are paying subs, and then we want to increase their engagement, which is obviously what we monetize. We have turned this around since the August 2 changeover, and we're on track to grow both total users and page views next year in 2007. ", "To do this, as we have said, we have really three basic legs to the strategy.  One is to reshape the access business by making AOL free to anyone with broadband. The second is to drive engagement and monetization.  The third is to reduce costs.  So, at the end of the third quarter, we had about 3 million free AOL e-mail accounts. Two-thirds of these came from converted members who, before we made this change, they used to leave the service and they used to leave the ad base.  But that also means we added 1 million new free users, over 1 million new free users that were not with us two months ago. ", "Our unique visitors were stable at 113 million, which is a very important part obviously.  It is the foundation of the advertising business.  The big news for us is that the page views decline in this quarter was only 5%. If you take out the fact that we moved our Time publishing titles out of the AOL, we only had a page view decline of 3%, and we started this change a month into the quarter. So what we are looking at here is page views turning around and starting to grow pretty soon.  ", "On the cost side, which is the last part, we're on track solidly.  It is a lot of work going into this to cut at least $1 billion by the end of '07.  At the rate we're going, we will do considerably better than that. So between all those points those are the things that underpin the ad growth rates, and we're having growth in advertising, Jessica, from all the product categories.  We had Ad.com, our third-party business, grew 95%.  Our display ads grew 39%, and search grew 27%.  The more people we have using this service and the more engagement in page views that we have per user -- because our usage is holding up as people move over to free, which is another big part of the success of this -- that will also and does drive search activity and revenue.  ", "Finally, we are in partnership with Google on search. So when we take our traffic and put it into that search category, it performs extremely well.", "Wayne Pace", "The last thing, Jessica, I would add to that, I think it is fair to say although we are not going to give specific estimates for next year, it is fair to say we are not counting on the kind of growth that we have been delivering for the last couple of quarters.  We would be happy to have it, but we are not counting on it. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from William Drewry - Credit Suisse. ", " William Drewry - Credit Suisse ", "Thank you. I just wanted to stick with AOL for a couple of questions.  I was just wondering, Jeff, does each division now have its own separate Internet strategy? You had an announcement out of Turner today.  They seem to be pursuing a lot of things, and now this new deluxe network.  I was just wondering how each of the divisions are working with AOL at this point going forward? ", "Also, I just wondered if you could quantify the marketing cost opportunity capture for next year? ", "And then just one other thing.  I guess Jonathan Miller had some comments last week that put speculation into the market about the future of AOL.  I was just wondering, is there any reason why AOL, given this great success that you're having right now, is not a core asset for the company going forward?  Thanks. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Well, AOL is definitely a core asset for the company and growing really well. On your digital question across the different businesses that Time Warner is in, Time Warner is the leading industry participant in five different industries: film, networks, publishing, cable, et cetera.  Each of those industries has obvious online or digital strategies.  We have them in each of our companies as we would if they were standing on their own ", "But having said that, there is tremendous advantages of some of the things that we can do together.  As for AOL, there are numerous products, for example, into TV with Warner Brothers, the combination of TMZ and People celebrity sites, which are the leading celebrity sites on AOL. There are so many; it is hard to remember. There is also, of course, things like the CNNMoney/Fortune cooperation between our publishing company and our Turner/CNN business, which is already the fourth-largest finance site. There are joint ventures underway with HBO and AOL in comedy.  ", "There are just a tremendous number of ways that if you look at it say, from my position, where we look at essentially a common set of metrics across our different businesses.  If you go through from publishing to networks into AOL, all of them need to focus on unique visitors and driving traffic.  ", "We have terrific leadership, say, in our print leadership branch.  Just to use one, let's say, People.  It has got about 40 million readers in print. We've got over 5 million uniques already on the People.com site,  250 million page views a month so it is the leading celebrity cite online.  Sports Illustrated is 450 million page views a month. ", "Basically when we get together, we look at all these businesses from HBO to CNN to People on both the previous distribution method, which is either the printed page or the television screen, and increasingly the new distribution method, which is a broadband PC screen or a mobile device screen, and the things that we learn in one division, we can apply in another. ", "Dick Parsons", "Bill, you know, your question is a good one in that it does point to something that I would say has a subtle but significant difference in the way we are thinking about the interrelationship with all these businesses and assets. As Jeff has just indicated, each of our operating divisions has to have its own Internet strategy, its own strategy for moving its brands or its businesses onto the web.  AOL can be sometimes a partner in that and sometimes offer some assistance in terms of insights into that. But each of these businesses has to have its own strategy for how it is going to meld the digital opportunities the technologies present. ", "Now in terms of AOL being a core asset, when you think about what we're trying to do with that asset, which Jeff was explaining to Jessica in some earlier questions, we're trying to make it a more robust audience/advertising platform.  Because as we see from our other businesses in fact, advertisers are moving online, advertising dollars are shifting online.  What do we in our combination of businesses here in Time Warner? We have content revenues.  That is one revenue driver.  We've got subscription revenues.  That is one revenue driver.  We have got advertising revenues. ", "But we want to be in that game, in the online game, and where we can do it more robustly is AOL.  So AOL is a core asset of our portfolio because it is in one of the three big revenue driving streams that we fish in.  As Jeff said, we're very pleased with what is going on in terms of the new strategy.  ", "So I am not 100% sure exactly what musings that Jon Miller, who is doing a terrific job in terms of moving us to the strategy you were talking about, but it is a core asset, and I think we have got it on the right track. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "I thought -- Jon was over in Europe, and we just did the AOL Europe deals where we moved out of access and increased our footprint in audience and advertising. I think in response to questions if you are in Europe how does this apply to the United States? We would all say that we always evaluate any alternatives that are more profitable in the long run.  The long run is key to making that assessment. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs. ", " Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much. As I analyze the different drivers of advertising at AOL, the AOL business for advertising, excluding Ad.com, looks like it is up 33%.  When I peel through the advertising growth that has been driven by RPM growth versus page view declines, it basically looks as we go into 2007 that you need to have 15% to 20% RPM growth again, with low single-digit page view growth in order to get to what we have for industry growth in online advertising. ", "So my question, Jeff, specifically is, do you think you can get mid-teens to 20% growth in RPM again in 2007? And if not, what would you be assuming on the page view growth side to get to the industry growth rate? Thanks.", "Jeff Bewkes", "You know, let's go to the page views.  As we said, the decline is now down to 3% if you factor out moving our own titles out of Time Inc.  That is in the first two months of a change where out of the three months of the quarter, one of them we were under the old method. What that means to me, if you look of the last two or three years, page views have been declining there because of the loss of paying subs in the 15% a year or more range.  That is over with.  So that means page views won't be declining for that reason. ", "We think users will go up if you look at paying plus free registered users, and as we have said, that means the page views are going to increase. I'm not going to give a specific mix of what we're going to do with page views versus what we're going to do with RPMs.  I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give specific guidance on ad growth rates in relation to the industry. ", "Inherent in your question is, we feel very good about how we are going to do in ad revenue growth in relation to industry ad revenue growth in online. That will come from a combination of the two things you mentioned.  Just to finish, I don't think it is unreasonable for us to do RPM growth in the neighborhood of what you asked about. ", " Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs", "Do you also consider any risk to companies like Yahoo! that are only selling 50% of their page views, basically flooding the market with a lot of second-tier inventory through processes similar to Advertising.com through their investment in Right Media, and could there be any risk of deflation in pricing as it relates to the inventory that you're really selling at a much higher rate today? ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Are you asking whether our competition is flooding the market with not so good inventory?  ", " Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs", "Up until this point, Yahoo! has only been selling about 50% of its page views, and they are finding it more and more challenging to compete with the methodologies of selling through companies like Advertising.com and other competitors. And so they have made a strategic shift to try to sell a much greater percentage of their page views that previously they had not sold because it would have diluted their pricing on their premium product.  ", "So, as they start to try to sell through 70% to 75% of their page views instead of 50%, there is going to be a lot of other available inventory at much, much more competitive pricing than we have seen in the past.  Is that a factor that is weighed into your outlook for 2007? ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Yes, we are not worried about that.  Two advantages.  One is what I was trying to explain, which is engagement.  As we said when we shifted over on August 2, we have a user base at AOL that has the strongest, the longest session online, the most page views on the web. We have got an extremely engaged user base, and we see that holding up as they move over to free registered user status.  Combining that with our capability at Ad.com and in other parts of AOL and video advertising, to monetize not just our own inventory but everybody else's, we are actually, I think, increasing our competitive position in that field. So those trends you cite are good for us. ", "James Burtson", "The one thing I would add to that is that in your analysis, what is different for us I think or I don't want to say it is confusing, but page views and usable inventory are not necessarily the same thing. So, as you are aware, we have actually been growing our available inventory through the year with the inclusion of the client email, which is obviously a big category online, a premium category in terms of pricing. So I think we see pretty good headroom in front of us in terms of our ability in the mix to have good increases for RPMs, whether it is from both volume and inventory mix. ", " Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lowell Singer - Cowen & Co. ", " Lowell Singer - Cowen & Co ", "Jeff, I wanted to ask you a question about film entertainment.  Are you highly confident that you can grow the bottom line at that business next year?  Can you lay out for us the key things that need to happen both along the theatrical release side and also the syndication and home video side for you guys to return to growth there next year? ", "Jeff Bewkes", "I am highly confident that we will grow the earnings in the film side next year. We have always said it, but it is worth emphasizing.  We had a hell of a year in '05.  It was a record year in theatrical.  We were number one domestic and worldwide, home video, television, everything.  So the film business moves around a little bit, and looking just at this next couple of months in '06, we have got essentially the top of our line upcoming at the late release schedule between The Departed, which is doing very well; Happy Feet is going to be a big film; Blood Diamond is going to be a big film.  But they are all coming at the end of the year, which means the theatrical revenue, a good piece of it and all of the video revenue, flows into 2007. That is very auspicious both for the end of this year and for next year.  ", "When you look at the rest of Warner's, which is not just film, and New Line too, but also television at Warner's, really the advantage that Warner's and our diversified film business between Warner's and New Line has is we are the largest and most consistently successful earnings and cash flow producer in the film and TV studio business.  We have had that every year for the last five or six years. We've got pretty big and diverse slates both in film and television.  ", "On the film side, I think it has been well covered that we have an ongoing flow of more big event films than other competitors have.  And in television, that is essentially true as well because we are selling two, three, four series to everyone of the five broadcast networks, which I don't believe anyone else is doing. So we do have next year in TV, six shows coming off network syndication.  Four of them are already sold.  They include Two and a Half Men, Cold Case, Georgia Lopez, One Tree Hill, The OC and What I Like About You.  So we're looking very good and quite happy about how '07 is shaping up.  ", "The same thing for New Line, which has a good slate lined up.  It is going to perform well this year, and it is going to do well next year we think.  You can never completely predict.  Witness Poseidon -- every once in a while one of your ships sinks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vijay Jayant - Lehman Brothers. ", " Vijay Jayant - Lehman Brothers ", "Most of my questions are answered.  I just wanted to make the observation on your presentation on the cable historical systems.  Those exclude now the Houston and the systems transferred to Comcast, so even that comparison to the old Time Warner is not apples-to-apples. So I think the net add numbers that seem a little light arguably are not as light as it sort of looks visually.  Is that a fair comment? ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Yes. ", "Wayne Pace", "Yes, actually the trending schedules are now available online.  We show that recast exactly so that you can see in the historical Time Warner Cable systems the change is off the lower base over the periods covered in the trending schedules.  ", "Jeff Bewkes", "The analysis I think is going to be published, so the rest of you could include it in your own models. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Greenfield - Pail Research. ", " Richard Greenfield - Pail Research ", "A question on cable.  When you look at the Time Warner Cable S1, they actually broke out pro forma Q2, as well as pro forma fourth quarter for last year. I believe just as everything is represented now for the Q3 numbers are the ending subscriber numbers that you showed now.  I wondered if you could just talk to the deceleration because I don't know the Q1 and Q2 breakout, -- but certainly a deceleration in Q3, including the Adelphia systems in terms of both basic digital and data?  It decelerated, you actually added basic subs on average throughout the entire system for the first two quarters of the year, and you had digital subscribers of like 200,000 plus adds in the first half and 300,000 plus data adds. ", "So just understanding what happened, including Adelphia?  Why did Adelphia slow down because that seems to be the biggest drag in Q3?  That would be great. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Precisely because we have this sort of S1 out there, the lawyers have schooled us all that there is only so much we can say at this point in time.  So I'm going to ask our lawyer who is sitting here.  How do you want us to step up to Rich's question?  I don't know that we can wander into that minefield. ", "Unidentified Corporate Representative", "There is historical data, but I would not give them a lot of specific projections about what you see happening in the future. ", "Unidentified Corporate Representative", "I think the other thing to keep in mind is that with pro forma information it is precisely that with respect to the historical, it is based on systems that are not operated on a combined basis.  It is always very clear that pro forma historical information may not reflect what future performance would be.  You take that all into mind and do take a look at the documents, but the pro forma themselves are inherently limited in what  the information they can provide. ", " Richard Greenfield - Pail Research ", "But it would be fair to say that page 10 of the S1 that breaks out subscribers, all of those metrics for Q4 '05 and Q2 '06 are on the same exact basis as you reported this quarter's end of Q3 subscriber numbers? ", "Wayne Pace", "Rich, as best as we can ascertain it, because remember we did not run these systems.  They were not under our financial reporting and our control. So if you want  [inaudible]. ", " Richard Greenfield - Pail Research ", "Just one quick follow-up.  You spoke to a 15% revenue growth in historical systems, but you did not speak to an EBITDA growth in historical.  Could you give us some sense of that? ", "Wayne Pace", "You can\u2019t see it in the room, but our legal team is looking at us and shaking their heads.  The difficulty, Rich, and we will work through the difference in margins and stuff as best we can in the realm of what is appropriate offline and talk to you about the drivers that are readily available to you in the financial reporting. But it becomes much more difficult to separate what is affecting the acquired systems versus the historical TWC systems once you get below revenue and you get away from the actual subscriber numbers.  ", "Because, let's put it this way, most of the systems they are acquiring are fitting into existing clusters.  So it becomes an allocation question of where do the integration costs go when you conform billing systems and things like that. There's a lot of judgment in that, and I don't think under the S1 process we feel comfortable doing that. ", " Richard Greenfield - Pail Research ", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Gordon Hodge - Thomas Weisel Partners. ", "Gordon Hodge - Thomas Weisel Partners ", "Great, thanks. Just a question on AOL Europe, the Europe transaction.  Just how should we think about the ad revenue opportunity there?  Should we think of you more as an agent in the Ad.com role as you take over ad sales there with your partners, or is it perhaps a more generous kind of split arrangement? ", "Lastly also, if you could comment, Jeff, a little bit about the DVD marketplace, what you see out there?  I think units and sales were down a little bit, but any anything to discern from that? ", "Dick Parsons", "I think Jeff will deal with the DVD part.  I think the answer is the latter in your formulation of a more generous split arrangement where essentially AOL will continue to be either the lead page for the customers we are sending into the new access provider or as a default page for other customers of the access provider, and there will be a split arrangement on the advertising revenues generated, which we are very pleased with the split.  So I will put it that way. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "On DVD, we all know that the growth rate has slowed, but the category is still robust in terms of revenues and profits. I think it is important to remember that the DVD player has had the fastest consumer adoption of I think any consumer electronic device. So the current market status is consumer spending on home entertainment, rentals and purchases for the first nine months of this year '06 was up slightly 1% we think to about $14.7 billion.  That is coming from video business research.  Sales of all formats, if you took DVD, VHS, PlayStation and high def were pretty much flat at around $9 billion, $9.1 billion through September. DVD sales were up 2%, and the rental market was up almost 2% to $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion.  ", "So it has slowed down from the old days, but in that market, even in this year's theatrical lineup, Warner Home Video representing Warner, some of New Line, some of HBO, is the number one share seller at 19% of the market. So that is the market stat, that is our position in the market.  We think it will come up as the rest of the year unfolds. ", "James Burtson", "Thanks, Gordon.

(Operator Instructions). ", "Today's conference is being recorded. If you do have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the call over to Jim Burtson, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's 2007 first quarter Earnings Call. This morning, we issued two press releases, one detailing our first quarter results, the other updating our 2007 business outlook. ", "Before we begin, there were a few items I need to cover. First, we refer to non-GAAP measures, including Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA, and free cash flow. We use these measures when we analyze year-over-year comparisons. In order to enhance comparability, we eliminate certain items such as non-cash impairments, gains or losses from asset disposals, and amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations. We call this measure Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or adjusted OIBDA. ", "Schedules setting out reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to operating income and cash provided by operations or the other most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as applicable, are included in our trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our company's website, at www.timewarner.com/investors. A reconciliation of our expected future financial performance is also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. ", "Second, as a result of the sales of the Parenting Group, most of the Time4 Media titles and the Progressive Farmer magazine as well as the planned sales of Leisure Arts, the Atlanta Braves franchise and certain non-core AOL Wireless businesses, the company has presented the financial results for these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented. ", "The 2006 discontinued operations also reflected the operating results of Time Warner Book Group and the Turner South network as well as Cable Systems transfer to Comcast, in the Adelphia and Comcast transactions. ", "Third, you will see a section of our earnings release that describes the basis of presentation for Time Warner Cables results. On January 1, 2007, Texas and Kansas City Cable partners distributed its assets to its partners. Time Warner Cable received the Kansas City Pool for which we began consolidating financial results on January 1, 2007. ", "In this morning's presentation, the systems that we acquired in the Comcast and Adelphia transactions are referred to as the Acquired Systems. The term Legacy Systems when used in the presentation of financial results refers to those systems that Time Warner Cable owned both before and after the Adelphia and Comcast transactions. This same term when used in the presentation of subscriber information also includes the Kansas City Pool. ", "Today, we will refer to certain pro forma financial results for Time Warner Cable. The pro forma financial information for the first quarter of 2006 presents the results as if the Adelphia and Comcast transaction and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool had occurred on January 1, 2006. Reconciliations of the pro forma financial information to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP are included in the trending schedules posted on the company's website. ", "Finally, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by the statements herein due to changes in economic, business, competitive, technological, strategic and/or regulatory factors. ", "More detailed information about these factors may be found in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and its quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation to, and in fact expressly disclaims any such obligation, to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ", "With that covered, I'll thank you and turn the call over to Dick ", "Dick Parsons", "Thanks Jim, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. We appreciate your joining us today on our first quarter earnings call. Here is the morning's agenda. First, I'll give you my perspective on the overall company and where we are headed. Next, our CFO, Wayne Pace, will briefly take you through the results of the quarter. And then we'll go to the Q&A session at which time our President and COO, Jeff Bewkes, will join us. ", "Before diving into the details, let me set out to you what I believe are the three main takeaways from this first quarter. First is that AOL, which had a great quarter continues to be on track with the strategy we laid out last August, and our confidence enables progress that keeps growing. Second takeaway is that Time Warner Cable is delivering outstanding results and we have every expectation that they will continue to do so. And third, taken together, our business results in the first quarter give us great confidence and should give you great comfort that we will attain all of our full year financial objectives. ", "Now, let's get into the details of the quarter. I am pleased to say, Time Warner generated strong operating results, adjusted Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization or adjusted OIBDA grew 19% including the impact of the cable systems acquired from Adelphia and Comcast. We again delivered free solid cash flow converting over 30% or almost $1 billion of our adjusted OIBDA to free cash. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $0.22, up 10% from the prior year. ", "As you saw in this morning's business outlook release, we've reaffirmed our expectation of mid to high teen full year adjusted OIBDA growth. Also, we continue to anticipate converting 30% to 40% of our adjusted OIBDA to free cash flow. ", "In addition, we raised our guidance for diluted earnings per share by $0.05 to approximately $1.05. We increased our EPS outlook, based primarily on better than expected first quarter operating results, coupled with the anticipated positive impact of financing activities we undertook this past April. ", "Turning to our businesses, I trust that most of you were able to listen to Time Warner Cable\u2019s very first earnings call earlier this morning. So I won't spend as much time as I normally would, but let me review the highlights. Overall growth in every key subscriber category accelerated from the fourth quarter, driving over 900,000 net RGU additions. ", "The Legacy Time Warner Cable system performed extremely well, generating 12% revenue growth. The Acquired Systems began to show improvement and Time Warner Cable expects to stand the basic subscriber losses in these new systems during the second half of this year. ", "Cable also plans to roll out digital phones across the entire footprint by the end of 2007. Overall Triple Play penetration is now at 12% and we've plenty of upside ahead of us. Simply stated, Time Warner Cable is in a great position vis-\u00e0-vis its competition. With its robust plan, Time Warner Cable is the only company in this footprint that can provide today, compelling video, data and voice services at scale. ", "While competition works to catch-up with our existing offerings, Time Warner Cable keeps extending its leadership position by continually introducing a host of innovative new products that consumers want. ", "Moving to AOL, we are very pleased with the progress that it has made against its new advertising strategy, and as I started out saying, our confidence in our ability to achieve all of the goals that we outlined for you last August is higher than ever. ", "AOL\u2019s advertising revenue grew at or above 40% for the fourth consecutive quarter. And we expect AOL to keep growing their online advertising throughout the year at or above the domestic industry rate. Albeit that gross rates is lower than the 40% we posted this quarter. ", "With strong adjusted OIBDA growth of 27% in the quarter, AOL was well positioned to grow overall profit for the year. Equally as important to the long-term success of the business, AOL is on track to begin to grow its page views, which is a key to the success of its advertising strategy. In fact, on a sequential basis, page views were essentially flat this quarter for the first time since we started reporting this metric. ", "Looking briefly at the performance of our remaining segments, the results at our Filmed Entertainment, Networks and Publishing segments were all strong enough to keep us on track to meet our outlook for the full year. ", "As we entered the year, we expected Filmed to be down substantially in the first half of the year and then up sharply in the second half of the year. This is due to the timing of releases as well as comparisons to the prior year's results. ", "Although the segment's adjusted OIBDA was down 27% in the quarter, we are pleased with the results given the difficulty of year-over-year comparisons to a quarter that included more than $220 million of contribution from Wedding Crashers and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire alone. ", "The results at our networks were largely in line with our expectations, turning ahead solid OIBDA growth while at the same time, we felt the impact of long planned incrementals through the output programming investments at HBO. ", "While we are not happy about being down at Time Inc., we are pleased with the progress the business is making with its digital initiatives. For example, gross in Time Inc.'s online add revenue more than offset declines in magazine publishing revenue. We see this not only continuing, but increasing over the course of the year. ", "I'll finish up by updating you on our share repurchase program. To date, we have spent approximately $18.4 billion buying back our stock. In total, we repurchased over 1 billion shares representing more than 21% of our outstanding shares since we began the program at an average price of $18.27 per share. And as I said before, we plan to complete our $20 billion program by the end of the second quarter. After we close it out, we will review with our Board how best to allocate the future incremental capital. As we consider this, I can assure you that we will remain committed to allocating capitals for the benefit of our shareholders. ", "In summary then, I would say we've gotten off to an excellent start and we're feeling pretty good about the rest of the year. With that, I thank you again, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wayne Pace. ", "Wayne Pace", "Thanks, Dick, and good morning also to everyone. As usual, the slides that I will refer to in my comments are available for you on our website, and we will start with a look at the first quarter results. Revenues increased 9% over the prior year to $11.2 billion. Adjusted OIBDA grew 19% in the quarter to $3.1 billion and our margin was 28%. That's the highest that it's been in five years. As Jim mentioned in his remarks, these results reflect certain businesses that we're accounting for as discontinued operations for all periods presented. ", "Moving to the next slide, diluted earnings per share before those discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of an accounting change was $0.30 in the quarter and that\u2019s compared to $0.26 in 2006. Both years had items that affected the comparability. Included in this year\u2019s current quarter were pre-tax gains of approximately $670 million related to the sale of AOL\u2019s internet business, the access business in Germany, and approximately $146 million associated with the distribution of assets of the Texas and Kansas City joint ventures in our cable company. These gains were offset in part by $163 million related to the remaining securities litigation matters. ", "The net benefit of these items to our diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.08 and therefore adjusted EPS was $0.22, and that\u2019s a 10% increase over the comparable prior year measure. This increase reflects the benefit from the share repurchase program and that\u2019s offset in part by the dilutive affect of the acquired Adelphia and Comcast cable systems. ", "Looking on the next slide at free cash flow, we had a really good start to the year generating $973 million in free cash flow. We converted 31% of our adjusted OIBDA into free cash. The current quarter was negatively affected by a swing in working capital and that's related to the timing within the year of cash collections and payments. This slide provides the usual detail that we give you each quarter and certainly call us if you want more detail. ", "Moving to the next slide, we ended the first quarter with net debt of $34 billion that\u2019s up about $550 million from the end of 2006. Walking down the slides, the increase reflects $2.1 billion in share repurchases and $2.11 million in dividend payments, offset in part by the free cash flow of $973 million. Net proceeds of $850 million from the sale of AOL's German Internet access business and the proceeds from the sales of the Parenting Group and most of the Time4 Media titles. ", "In addition, the increase in net debt reflects $551 million of payments related to the securities litigation and government investigations which is shown in the other line item on this slide. Also I would mention that an additional $360 million in payments is expected to be made in the second quarter and this will resolve substantially all of the remaining securities litigation claims. ", "This next slide shows you the numbers on the progress of our share repurchase program which Dick talked with you about in his remarks. Also, as Dick mentioned we've updated our full year business outlook for you this morning. We continue to expect the percentage growth and full year adjusted OIBDA to be in the mid to high teens, of a base of $11 billion in 2006 and we except to convert between 30% to 40% of our adjusted OIBDA into free cash flow. ", "We now expect earnings per diluted share for the full year of 2007 to be approximately $1.05. And as a reminder for you our 2007 EPS guidance reflects the impact from the share repurchase program and approximately $0.10 per diluted share related to the sale of assets in investments as well as expenses in the first quarter related to securities litigation and the government investigations. ", "So overall to repeat, we were pleased with the start of this year and remain confident that we are on track to meet all of our 2007 financial objectives. And so we want to go through the results for each of our segments and then we will get into Q&A. ", "We'll start with AOL. Last August, management laid out a strategy to prioritize AOL's advertising business while repositioning its subscriber business and to adjust its cost to reflect that strategy. As Dick mentioned, AOL has made great progress against these stated objectives and its financial results also reflect this progress. ", "AOL's advertising revenues in the quarter continue to grow at very healthy rates. They were up at least 40% for the fourth consecutive quarter. Growth was strong across all advertising revenue sources including display and paid-search advertising on the AOL Network of owned and operated properties as well as advertising on Partner Sites. ", "Display advertising on the AOL Network rose 32%. Paid-search on the AOL Network was up 26% and advertising on Partner Sites grew 81% and that includes the continuing impact of a relationship with a major customer that was expanded substantially in the second quarter of 2006. Even without this impact from that major customer relationship advertising revenues generated on the Partner Sites primarily through the advertsisng.com business, was a up a very strong 29%. ", "Included in display advertising revenues on the AOL Network for the quarter was a $19 million benefit relating to a change in accounting estimate. This resulted for more timely ", " system data and correspondingly improved estimates. Including this $19 million benefit, AOL advertising revenue still grew a very strong 35% compared to that 40% number -- excluding the $19 million benefit, it grew 35% compared to the 40%. ", "As expected, subscription revenues continue to decline as AOL strategically reduced acquisition marketing spending and subscribers churned or they converted to free accounts. In addition subscription revenues from AOLs Internet access businesses in the UK and France and Germany declined approximately $300 million from last year's first quarter to approximately $90 million in the current quarter due to the sales of those businesses. ", "The 43% decrease in subscription revenues in the current quarter led to the 25% decline in total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA rose 27%. Again these results reflect the impact of executing AOL strategy as a plan reduction in marketing cost and lower network cost offset the decline in revenues. ", "As you look out over the year, it\u2019s important to be mindful that the first quarter is likely to be the largest in terms of adjusted OIBDA at AOL. This is because of significant portion of the cost reductions most notably reductions in marketing spending have already taken effect. While subscribers are expected to continue to decline throughout the year, thereby reducing quarterly adjusted OIBDA in the remainder of 2007. ", "Also please keep in mind that while AOL ad revenues are expected to continue to increase year-over-year resulting from growth across all ad revenue sources. Ad revenue is generated on partner sides are expected to increase at significantly lower rate than they did in this first quarter. This is due to the lapping if you will of the expanded relationship with the major customer that initially occurred in the second quarter of 2006 that we talked about just a moment ago. ", "This next slide depicts AOLs web metrics. For the first quarter, AOL\u2019s domestic ad revenue less traffic acquisition cost or TAC was $345 million up 25% year-over-year. Average monthly domestic unique visitors of $111 million was flat compared to the fourth quarter. ", "Total domestic page views were approximately $44 billion that's down 1% from the fourth quarter. As a result AOL averaged 132 million page views per unique visitor. Domestic ad revenue less TAC for 1,000 page views of $7.85 for the quarter and that included the impact of advertising stock comps revenue generated on it's partner sites was 3% lower than the seasonally high fourth quarter. ", "Moving to Cable, we are not going to go into very much detail here since the Cable folks reported their first quarter results earlier this morning and we hope you had the opportunity to listen on to the call where they discussed the company's very strong operating and financial results for the quarter. ", "Time Warner Cable's revenues increased 61% and Web.de grew 54%. Once again these reported results reflect the impact of the acquisition of certain cable systems from Adelphia and Comcast on July 31, 2006 as well as the consolidation of the Kansas City approval on January 1, 2007. ", "Looking at these first quarter 2007 results compared to the pro forma results for the first quarter of 2006, revenues grew 10% while OBIDA increased 12% for the quarter. Margins improved about 50-basis points on a pro forma basis. ", "This next slide shows cable subscriber highlights for the quarter. We have provided you with additional discloser in the earnings release, detailing subscriber information for the Acquired Systems as well as the Legacy Systems. And you can also access Time Warner Cable's earnings release, its business outlook release and their earnings presentation and the call replay on their website. ", "Moving on to film, revenues declined 1% over the prior year due primarily to lower home video revenues and this decrease reflects the difficult comparisons to the prior year's releases of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and New Lines Wedding Crashers. Offsetting these declines were higher worldwide theatrical revenues led by the release of 300 and increased television license fees. The 27% decrease in OIBDA was driven by higher print and advertising expenses related to the quantity and mix of releases by lower home video revenues and by a $42 million benefit in the prior year from the sale of certain international film rights. ", "These 2007 declines were offset partly by higher worldwide contributions from television product. As Dick mentioned, we expect film segment OIBDA to be down in the first half of the year and then up sharply in the second half. To that point, let me remind you that the second quarter of last year including contributions from the second-cycle just in the case of Friends, the off-network availability of the first three seasons of Without a Trace and the carryover home video sales of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. We\u2019d also like to remind you that our film slate is heavily weighted towards the second half of this year, which includes the midyear releases of Warner Brothers Ocean\u2019s 13 and Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, which will be followed by New Line's Rush Hour 3 and His Dark Materials: The Golden Compass. ", "Moving to the Networks Group, revenues were flat for the quarter and this reflects the closing of operations at the WB Network in September of last year, offset by growth in subscription, content and cable advertising revenues. Subscription revenue growth of 6% was driven by higher rates and to a lesser extent an increase in subscribers at both Turner and at HBO. ", "As we expected the absence of the WB Network lead to a 12% decline in ad revenues. Turner's ad revenues grew 6% in the quarter as a result of gains across essentially all of their segments, most notably in the News Group. OIBDA growth of 6% was driven by higher subscription revenues and the absence of losses at the WB Network which represented 4 percentage points of that growth. ", "And lastly at Publishing. Revenues declined 1% compared to the prior year primarily reflecting a $28 million decrease in other revenues mostly due to declines at Synapse and Southern Living at Home, partly offset by 3% growth in ad revenues. Ad revenues benefited from higher online revenues including gains at People.com, CNNMoney.com and SI.com. This growth was offset in part by lower print magazine advertising. OIBDA was down 28% due to higher restructuring charges, lower contributions from the non-magazine businesses and decreases at certain domestic magazines. ", "That is the end of our prepared remarks and Jim will start the Q&A process for us. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks Wayne, operator can we turn to questions? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes we can. (Operator Instructions). Thank you, Doug Mitchelson you may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, Deutsche Bank, good morning, thank you very much. Buried in Jim's scintillating opening comments was that the Braves were moved into discontinued operations. Can we get an update on the state of that transaction and the bigger question for Dick or Jeff is on your strategy at AOL. You spent much of the past few years successfully pulling a lot of capital out of AOL. Now it's at an interesting juncture in the new strategy with page view starting to flatten out and advertising growth terrific. Is now the time to start aggressively reinvesting in the AOL web business to begin to build traffic? And off-course that's the opposite of the view of those who would suggest you should spin the business out. So, I'm hoping for any comment on the strategy for AOL as well as if you could tell, if you do desire to begin reinvesting where that might be thanks? ", "Dick Parsons", "Okay Doug. I'll start and then I am going to ask Jeff who has joined us follow up AOL piece a bit. In terms of the Braves transactions, as we put something out with there to go, saying that we have entered into a letter of intent with liberty and that it was before Major League Baseball. Beyond that I can't say, Major League Baseball is considering this transaction right now and we are hopeful that they will get through it in due course. But beyond that it would inappropriate for me to say, and so I won't. ", "Regarding AOL, I think the source to your question is right. I am going to pick up the last part first and then turn it over to Jeff, there are sorts of speculation that one reads in the business press. There are lots of people out there trying to help us figure what to do with our company including your spinning AOL and all that sort of things. We are focused on executing on this strategy, we think its going very well so far and making the kind of investments in the business that is going to strengthen it over time as part of our company and with that Jeff you want to give some sense or review of it. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Yeah Doug, I would continue in the direction Dick is going. We are interested and clearly we are able across Time Warner to invest resources in anything that\u2019s got a superior return and that increases our strategic position. AOL is a very strong candidate for investment inside our company, because of the robust growth of the industry in which it completes and AOL own strong growth. You mentioned a very good point, which is page view is not only flattening but starting to increase this year, which is what our expectation is and that expectation is supported by our most recent month-to-month numbers across AOL's metric. So, we are very interested in both doing various parts of AOL's competitive advantage. You all did see that few months ago, we almost acquired a company in Sweden TradeDoubler, which at the end we did not finish due to basically what we've thought was an excess price. ", "But that's a fairly good indication of the kind of things we will look at and we can't and, obviously, we wouldn't say the things that we are doing right now. But we are always on the look for accretive investments and certainly at AOL. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks Doug. Operator, next question please? ", "Operator", "Thanks you. Jessica Reif Cohen, you may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Jessica Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Merrill Lynch. I'm having two parts. First on cable, you've indicated in the past a willingness to own a smaller piece of the bigger company. I was wondering if you would comment at all if Cablevision's announcement pushes this agenda on a faster timeframe. And the second question is on film; the DVD revenue when the trending schedule was down 22% and units were down roughly 7%. Where is the pricing pressure coming from? ", "Dick Parsons", "I'll start Jessica and then ask Jeff to hit the second part of your question. Again, you\u2019ve all had an opportunity to read the business press, once again helping us think through what to do with our assets. A lot of that is fanciful, I don't know where it comes from. My position is the same as it has been, and I have articulated in these calls over the last couple of years. We like cable first of all. We like the cable business. We think that the guys who are shooting the lights out, you heard them this morning, all our operating metrics were up and the business is performing strongly. We like the fact that we, with our own currency in cable, can continue to participate in what I think will be the inevitable, irretractable consolidation of businesses in the cable space. We think we are well-positioned to do that. As far as the Cablevision announcement, I thought what they said was they, the family was buying not selling. But our position going all the way back for years, on Cablevision is if the Dolans ever were to decide to part with that asset, we would certainly want to be on their list of people to talk to. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Your second question, if I heard it right was DVD, in general for Warner's. We are pretty happy with what's happening in DVD and our company. Warner Home Video was number one in the industry for the first quarter with about at 18.5% share. Two of our titles The Departed and Happy Feet were the two top sellers in the quarter. But even though that is good and that's great, when you look at any company and our Film company on DVD you got to look at slate availability on what's going on from one year versus last year and as Wayne, said we had some huge DVD titles, even larger than those last year's. So, that accounts for any fluctuation quarter-to-quarter for our company. ", "For the year we look forward to a very strong performance and we think industry leading performance in DVD, given what releases will happen later in the year. You didn\u2019t ask Jessica, but in the overall industry consumer spending was down about 5% in the first quarter. But again, these things are in the industry as well, slate timing kinds of things and the US Film Industry is off to a good start and I think what every one is about to live through, fortunately consumers most of all is a very robust season of hits coming in to theatres in the next few weeks, and we will have some big films coming in there this spring, this summer as Wayne and Dick said. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks Jessica. Operator, next question? ", "Operator", "Thank you. Benjamin Swinburne you may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning, it\u2019s Ben Swinburne. Thanks for taking the question. Jeff, can I ask you on the programming side of Turner, what do you think the impact of commercial ratings and DVR homes into the rating system is going to have on the business and how does that affect your sort of programming investment decisions? ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Well, are you asking about the debates as to whether it should be three days or one day and looking at commercials minutes to the adverse of its programming, is that what? ", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "That\u2019s right. Yeah. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "None of us, none of you know exactly how that works. We don\u2019t worry about it too much. We think that there is a very strong first and second quarter scatter market, its going at the mid to high single-digit increases over upfront last year and this pretends a strong upfront usually, which is what we think will happen. As per our networks, we are having a pretty good year particularly in news. But our entertainment network ratings TNT and TBS are still in leading positions as they have been. TNT was a little down in the first quarter. Some of it's quarterly scheduling really, the only less than strong spot in the TNT programming lineup in the first quarter was the procedural dramas, which we have kind of rescheduled a little bit of that, we have put some movies in it. We are coming up to the strong part of our programming schedule, at TNT we've got our original Saving Grace coming in this next quarter, Heartland with Treat Williams, and The Closer, which is the biggest rated show on ad-supported cable is coming back, so are the NBA play-offs. ", "So that's basically why I'm pretty optimistic about TNT. TBS is holding its position in number two in prime, pretty well. Adult Swim remains the number one ratings deliverer for its 18 to 34 audience and more than any of the other networks that it competes, it's number one in that demo. So we're in a pretty good place in terms of the Turner ad-supported network. You didn\u2019t ask about HBO but that continues to be rolling along in a fairly strong consumer performance way. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Spencer Wang, you may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Spencer Wang - Bear Stearns", "Bear Stearns, thanks. Good morning. Just one question on AOL advertising. I think Wayne mentioned that excluding TAC or including TAC US advertisings at 25%. So, I guess if you take out that $19 million benefit that number would go to 19%. And I think in the fourth quarter ex-TAC US advertisings was up 39%. So I was just wondering if you could help us understand why there was a deceleration with this seasonality or am I missing something else. Thank you. ", "Wayne Pace", "Some of it was seasonality and that\u2019s the primary difference and so that you didn\u2019t have the right answer there of seasonality. But, on an overall basis, if you take the one $19 million item out on an overall basis, we were up 35% on total. ", "Spencer Wang - Bear Stearns", "Alright, thanks Wayne. ", "Wayne Pace", "If you take out the expanded relationship for the one customer that started in the second quarter of last year, we were up 29% year-over-year. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "We feel safe, Spencer in our other plans. We are going to grow our advertising performance at or above the industry average. So that means including in this quarter even after Wayne says all that that we believe we\u2019re taking share. ", "Jim Burtson", "Spencer it's Jim, the only think I would just add is that when I go through the numbers, net of TAC even you're up 27%. So, I would think it is pretty much in line or above where most of the industry was, certainly where most of the big competitors with the exception of Google were, higher than most of the big competitors actually. But thanks. Operator, can we move to next question. ", "Operator", "Thank you, Tuna Amobi you may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor's Equity Group", "Hi, Standard & Poor's Equity Group. I have two questions as well and the first one is for Dick. As you look at the deals, the Google deals with DoubleClick. I know you have a very somewhat intricate deal arrangement with Google. So, I guess the question is how does this affect the relationship in terms of specifically AD.com and what does that transaction in your mind mean for AOL's relationship with Google. And the second question, also a quick one, on capita allocation which you spoke about, what's the current bias right now that you are pretty close to finishing a $20 billion buyback. Would you be more biased to raising the dividends or are you looking perhaps to institute another buyback program or even perhaps kind of debt reduction. ", "Dick Parsons", "Okay. First of all, with respect to DoubleClick and Google, as you know currently AOL and Google are partners on the ad side and DoubleClick is an ad serving vendor for AOL. So, with the acquisition of DoubleClick by Google, should better happen, we certainly expect that Google will continue to honor DoubleClick's obligations under their current arrangement with AOL. So, we don\u2019t see much of a change there. And in terms of the state of our partnership with Google; we think its going very well. We think its one of that reasons that our ad numbers and gross has been as good as it is. And while we are taking share because we have been partnering very effectively together on that front and expect to continue to do so. With respect to a bias on the capital allocation side; I want to be careful here because, as those of you who have been listening to me going on here for years and years. Now I am sort of a one foot in front of the other kind of guy. ", "We have got to get through the current program, but we think we will beat through the current program, probably by the end of second quarter, at which point we'll take up with our Board, what to do next. I will just mention a couple of things that we have talked about before, but then you should keep in mind in terms of trying to anticipate our future. ", "One, we've said that we were comfortable in terms of running our balance sheet at a 3:1 leverage ratio. I still myself, I am pretty comfortable in that zone and I think as a consequence we'll be with a considerable incremental capital to sort of figure out how to put it to use best for our shareholders. And that could be any one of a number of things, you mentioned two of them, you mentioned dividends, you mentioned buyback. Jeff earlier talked about acquisitions in response to the question of Doug Mitchelson, I mean we are going to be alert on all fronts and we are going to evaluate where we think the highest return is for the placement of that incremental capital. ", "The only other thing I would say is that when we started our dividend program sometime ago, we did so with the hope and expectation that overtime if our confidence continued in the prospects of our business going forward which it certainly has and is, that we would seek to in a thoughtful and measured kind of way, increase our dividend as we go forward. I would just tell you that I remain highly confident in the future prospects of the business and so those are all themes that I would reinforce at this point in time, but I don\u2019t think I'll go further than that. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks Jim. Operator, if can you turn to our next question please? ", "Operator", "Thank you. Michael Nathanson you may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "Thanks Sanford Bernstein. I have one for Jeff on AOL. Jeff if you backed out the losses of the free trial subs of your AOL subs. It looks like that your subscriber losses are coming in below what people expected, so I'm wonder if you could speak to the composition of your current AOL sub base by tenured and non-tenured subs and how churn change over the past year or so, and what does that mean for your ad strategy? ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Well, good question. You are right. We are I mean, if you want to look at that way you can quote a little better in that, changing method, although we are happy to migrate subs over we are basically right now. Remember what we are trying to do. We are trying to reshape the access business by making it free to anyone with broadband. And then based on that increasing the number of users that we have, we are going to drive engagement and monetization of those users and that acquires we've been reducing cost as we move of a subscription provision and business. ", "So back to your question on composition. At the end of the first quarter, we had little over 8 million free AOL accounts, which remember that's, we've only been doing that since August of last year. We had around 12 million access subs and so the access subs decline a 1.2 million in the first quarter, which is a lower level of decline than in the fourth quarter of '06. ", "So in a way the thing is kind of stabilized I think to some extent. That's basically what's happening and of course that means if the total users on AOL registered users gone up. Now the more important issue than that [Unix] is up in a modest way because of your issue we've lot more users, we've got registered users, we've got tick ups in e-mail and yet the question then becomes how much engagement can you get out of that. ", "And what we've said is we are learning a lot about the migration of ourselves to free and based on the experience that we have, most of the narrow band subs, that convert to free they have gone to broadband obviously and we see a natural lift, when they do that and their usage pattern goes up in the 50% range if not higher. And so that's kind of we think [baked] into this current positive situation. But we, in addition to that are confident that as we bring our new product development features that are going to be rolling out this year in all of the basic tools and things that AOL users, free or not are used to. We think the engagement will go up even more. So that's why we are essentially the timing here in Dick\u2019s remarks and my remarks, it is positive [best it is]. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks Michael. Operator, please turn to the next question. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Jason Bazinet. You may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "I just have one other question on AOL. I guess if I go back to the third quarter of 2006 you lost about 2.5 million dial-ups subs, you lost about $2 million in the fourth quarter of '06 and you mentioned the $1.2 million this quarter. And you also mentioned just now Jeff about 8 million uniques. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color in terms of how many people are coming to the free property that they didn't have a building relationship with AOL on the dial-up side historically. And then what portion of the dial-up subs are actually, you know, sticking around and still using the AOL content now that it's free? ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Most of the subscribers moving [above all] subscription are sticking with the free registration over 80%. ", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Okay. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Do you mentioned something like in unique visitor, did you see $80 million? ", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "I said $8 million. I was just trying to repeat the number you said. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Okay. That was accretive best of free. That's the free account. Unique visitors is well over a 100 million. ", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Sure. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "So you have got about half of those migrated from paying subscription and the rest are basically new. ", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "So $4 million in '08? ", "Dick Parsons", "Yeah. ", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just one follow-up, how were the efforts progressive regarding generating advertising revenue off of AOL e-mail? ", "Dick Parsons", "That is what? ", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Your efforts to generate advertising revenue off your e-mail? ", "Dick Parsons", "It's going well, it's going up. By the way, our e-mail page views are growing at about, I don't know they are up about 7% that's quarter-to-quarter. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "And I think in our ad revenue -- I'll get the number here, hold on. I'm looking for the percentage. It's 40 plus, it's up from basically 38% to over 40% of the ad revenue connected to e-mail and it's been going up. ", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Noto. You may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much. It\u2019s Goldman Sachs. My question is on AOL advertising. On a reported basis, that growth rate is 35% as the accounting changes this quarter down from 49% in the fourth quarter and it's going up against the easiest competition of 2006 at 26% and my understanding over the last four quarters as that acceleration was really driven by increased sell-through and now we're seeing a deceleration. And I'm just concerned that is there enough sell-through left in the business of your existing pages that you haven't sold previously so that you can sustain a rate of growth in the 25% to 30% range beyond 2007, given in '08 there is less cost savings, subscription revenues will still be declining? Thanks. ", "Wayne Pace", "Yes, there is. Well, I remember there is an uplift in terms of inventory. You start going into all the different pieces. One thing I guess I would start with is not the only thing it is that all ad growth in that dot com is driven by third party networks not just AOL page views. But as we've said here we think AOL page views are going to start turning up, we think engagements on AOL's network is going to start turning up. Search queries have been growing again. So, no I don't see the concern that your potential or the basis of your concern. ", "Anthony Noto - Goldman Sachs", "Great thank you. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks Anthony. Operator next question please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Michael Morris you may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Michael Morris - UBS", "Hi, thank you. I'm with UBS. Another question on AOL regarding this subscriber side of the business. How did the decline in sales compared to your plan and do you expect the migration to continue to slow from this pace or stabilize at this level? ", "And then secondly also I understand your interested in operating the advertising side of AOL, but would it be possible operationally and from a structural perspective to separate the domestic accesses business and would you consider a strategic alternative for the dial-up business such as the sell if you could maintain that relationship with users as they migrate to broadband? Thanks. ", "Jim Burtson", "On you the first part of your question, which I think we've got it the way the that it' going in terms of how many subs are moving up and over to broadband, it's a little better idea a little lower, a little more retention to AOL than we thought. So at sense the one way of looking it you could say that's a positive. ", "Second thing that's positive and better than we plan is the retention of those who do go over to broadband the great majority or sticking and the number that\u2019s staying with us and their engagement and use of the service is all higher than we had planned. So that is good. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Well, the third thing that's to the positive is that our ability at AOL to attract new users that aren't coming from migration out of its subscription service is going a little better than we had planned so all of that leads through both subscription economics and total user base on which to sell advertising that\u2019s a bit better than what we had planned when we set out to do this. ", "Dick Parsons", "Well, I hope I answered to the first part of your question? On the point as to what to deal we want? ", "Michael Morris - UBS", "Yeah I might as well ask if you could expect paid subscriber level to stabilize at this level. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "At this level no we are going to keep moving them to three. We are trying to get included in this its efforts with distribution partners we are trying to make supportive cooperative arrangement as we have with cable and telephone access providers to make it as attractive as possible for people to choose whichever method that they want to use AOL through paid or free that suits them. So, all of that we think is going well, our aim is customer relationships in whichever method the customers wants and we think the business in the future for us is mostly at or of that. Therefore to your last question on what to do with the access in the form of (inaudible) of course its possible to do something where it could be more separated financially. However, I think you are on condition that you based the question on which is that you asked whether you would want to have a strong relationship if you give that with AOL users for the advertising business would have to be accomplished in doing anything like that. ", "Michael Morris - UBS", "Yes, at the risk of [overwriting] is putting. The other thing you should be thinking about is that one of the reasons I think we are feeling pretty good about where AOL is and is going against its new strategy because the focus has been on execution. Now, there is always tendency to think you can sort transact your way to some better place, but my experience is that, if you just stay focus on execution and get the execution right then good things come out of that. So, in the near-term here you can expect us to be focused more on executing against this strategy and driving more page views and then monetizing more effectively than trying to come up with busy transaction. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks Mike. Operator, I think we have time for one more question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question comes from Kathy Styponias. You may ask your question and please state your company name. ", "Kathy Styponias - Prudential Equity Group", "Thank you. It's the Prudential Equity Group. Jeff my question is for you. We've heard from Q Cable company as far one including Time Warner own, regarding how day and date release of the VOD/DVD is going. And so far the result seems to be pretty positive on both end in that. It seems to driving cable VOD business without hurting the film DVD business. So, it appears as though its coming from rental as appose to shell through and I was just wondering if you can remind us whether or not they are current web share agreements with Netflex and Blockbuster and how big that business is? And whether or not you could conform it looks like it is not sort of eating out of sell through, it's coming out of the rental business. And, I'll stop there. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Good question. And I think and I know, I will give the same answer as Wayne gave earlier which is that, its too early we are not really ready to precisely lay out what the results are showing. But I will say, the way you are asking is right. It\u2019s essentially a fairly positive outlook, which is what we went to the test for. And it seems that its going to be good in terms of how the consumers are responding for the sell-through business, it seems, it\u2019ll be fine for the studios and it\u2019ll be fine for the cable operators and to the extent that each sent to any card consumer used, its more rental than it is sell-through. So that is why the results seem positive. As for the arrangements we have with some of the current rental companies, we are not going to specify those. ", "Kathy Styponias - Prudential Equity Group", "Alright, thanks. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Thanks Kathy and thanks to everyone listening in the call. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks all. Bye-bye.

(Operator Instructions) Now I will turn the call over to James Burtson, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. ", "James Burtson", "Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner\u2019s 2007 second quarter earnings conference call. This morning, we issued two press releases: one detailing our second quarter results, and the other reaffirming our 2007 business outlook. ", "Before we begin, there are several items I need to cover. First, we refer to non-GAAP measures, including Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization -- OIBDA -- and free cash flow. We use these measures when we analyze year-over-year comparisons. In order to enhance comparability, we eliminate certain items such as non-cash impairments, gains or losses from asset disposals and amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations. We call this measure Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or adjusted OIBDA. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to operating income and cash provided by operations or the other most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as applicable, are included in our earnings release or trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our company\u2019s website at www.TimeWarner.com/investors. A reconciliation of our expected future performance is also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. ", "Second, as a result of the sales of the Parenting Group, most of the Time for Media titles, The Progressive Farmer magazine, Leisure Arts and the Atlanta Braves baseball franchise and the pending sales of Teget Communications and Wildseed, the company has presented the financial results of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented. ", "The 2006 operating results of Time Warner Book Group and the Turner South Network as well as cable systems transferred to Comcast in the Adelphia and Comcast transactions are reflected as discontinued operations. ", "Third, you\u2019ll see a section in our earnings release that sets out a description of the basis of presentation for Time Warner Cable\u2019s results. Today we will refer to certain pro forma financial results for Time Warner Cable, the pro forma financial information for the second quarter of 2006 presents the result as if the Adelphia and Comcast transactions and the consolidation of the Kansas City pool had occurred on January 1st, 2006. Reconciliations of the pro forma financial information to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP are included in the trending schedules posted on the company\u2019s website. ", "Finally, today\u2019s announcements include certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations or beliefs and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by the statements herein due to changes in economic, business, competitive, technological, strategic and/or regulatory factors. More detailed information about these factors may be found in Time Warner\u2019s SEC filings including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. ", "Time Warner is under no obligation to, and in fact expressly disclaims any such obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ", "With that covered, I\u2019ll thank you and turn the call over to Dick. ", "Richard Parsons", "Thanks, Jim and good morning ladies and gentlemen. We appreciate your joining us today on our second quarter earnings call. Here\u2019s the morning\u2019s agenda. First, as usual, I\u2019ll share my perspective on the overall company and where we\u2019re going. Next our CFO, Wayne Pace, will walk you through the results for the quarter. After that, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Bewkes will join us for your questions. ", "Before getting into the details, let me set out for you what I believe are the principal takeaways for the quarter. First is that Time Warner is on track to meet its full year business outlook for adjusted OIBDA growth, free cash flow generation and earnings per share. ", "The second is that we\u2019re continuing to invest in AOL for sustainable long-term growth and value creation. ", "Third is that we\u2019re committed to maintaining a healthy level of leverage and we\u2019ll keep using our capacity to return capital directly to our shareholders. I\u2019ll elaborate on each of these as I go through the quarter\u2019s results. ", "For the quarter, I\u2019m pleased to say Time Warner delivered solid operating results. Our adjusted OIBDA grew 20%, including the impact of the cable systems acquired from Adelphia and Comcast last year. Through the first half of the year, we also generated strong free cash flow, converting 33% or $2 billion of our adjusted OIBDA to free cash. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.22, up 16% from the prior year. As you read in today\u2019s business outlook release, we\u2019re reaffirming our expectation of mid to high teen adjusted OIBDA growth for the full year. Also, we continue to expect to convert 30% to 40% of our adjusted OIBDA to free cash. In addition, we anticipate diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.07, or $0.95 excluding $0.12 of the items detailed in our outlook. ", "Turning to our businesses, I hope you heard Time Warner Cable\u2019s earnings calls earlier this morning. In the typically seasonally weak second quarter, Time Warner Cable continued to thrive penetration gains in digital video, high speed data and digital phone subscriptions. Altogether, our cable colleagues added over 500,000 net RGUs and they are on track to achieve all of their full year objectives. Overall, triple play penetration now stands at 13%, up from 12% at the end of the first quarter and we see plenty of additional up side to come. We remain very comfortable with Time Warner Cable\u2019s competitive positions and ability to generate compelling growth over the duration of our long term plan. ", "Our confidence is based on the following business initiatives that provide tangible building blocks but continued strong growth. ", "First, there is still head room in the existing residential product lines in Time Warner Cable\u2019s legacy footprint. ", "Second, we have plenty of up side to realize from the acquired Adelphia and Comcast properties. ", "Third, there are significant medium-term opportunities to gain shares in a sizable small to medium commercial space. ", "Fourth, we see great longer term potential to create meaningful value through advanced advertising. ", "With these opportunities we expect cable to continue to be a powerful generator of growth for years to come. ", "Turning to our film segment, OIBDA was down 24% at the second quarter. As we told you last quarter, a decline was expected due to the timing of releases as well as difficult comparisons to prior year results. We anticipate that this reporting line will be up strongly in the second half of the year, more than enough to deliver significant growth for the full year. We\u2019re already off to a great start in the third quarter. ", "Since its opening on July 11th, I\u2019m happy to report that the latest Harry Potter movie has generated about $700 million in worldwide box office, and we have Rush Hour 3, the Golden Compass and Iron Legend still to come. We\u2019re looking for a very big year for Warner Brothers and New Line. ", "Moving to our network segment, we saw a double-digit increase in OIBDA. Fueling this growth were very strong results offset in part by the impact of the planned incremental studio output programming investments at HBO. ", "At publishing, we\u2019re pleased to return to OIBDA growth, a 12% increase. For the second quarter in row, digital ad revenue more than offset declines in magazine ad revenue and we see this trend continuing throughout the year. ", "Now to AOL, where the company continued to make progress against its strategy. As you know, we expect AOL\u2019s adjusted OIBDA to grow for the full year and this quarter\u2019s results keep us well positioned to achieve that objective. We also anticipate that AOL will begin growing its page views on a year-over-year basis in 2007 and the business remains on track to do just that. In fact, on a sequential basis, page views were up this quarter for the first time since we started reporting this metric at the end of 2005. Growing page views is a key to sustaining AOL\u2019s advertising success. ", "As you saw in our earnings release, however, AOL\u2019s advertising growth was 16% in the quarter, a significant slowdown compared to the 40% we generated last quarter. Let me briefly walk you through the reasons why. First, we told you last quarter our advertising growth would dial back as we passed the anniversaries of significant advertising deals launched last year. Second, in the quarter, AOL made significant programming enhancements to many of its main channels, including health, music and autos, as well as improvements to such core products as email and search. All of these changes are aimed at building user engagement and ultimately driving increased monetization, and in the main, AOL management team has been satisfied with the early results. ", "That said, these kinds of up grades often lead -- at the beginning -- to a slowing in traffic and monetization. When you modify programming for example, uses routinely require a little time to become accustomed to the redesigned pages while advertisers naturally want to see how the new programming performs before reinvesting significantly. In other words, improvements like these to AOL\u2019s programming and products which we\u2019re confidence will yield long term benefits comes with short term disruptions. ", "Finally, as have others in the industry, we\u2019ve seen advertising demand shift recently toward third-party advertising networks. This puts some pressure on AOL\u2019s display advertising in the quarter. AOL\u2019s well-positioned to compete in this changing dynamic with Advertising.com, a major force among third party advertising networks. ", "All in all however, while we continue to expect AOL\u2019s page use to increase on a year-over-year basis, and its adjusted OIBDA growth for the full year, we\u2019re stepping back from our expectation that AOL will grow its advertising at or above the domestic industry growth rate this year. ", "Looking ahead, AOL\u2019s management team will keep making these types of significant programming and product enhancements. In fact, subsequent to closing the quarter, AOL relaunched news, sports and shopping. Just yesterday, the new AOL.com home page became widely available. Next up, we\u2019ll upgrade our real estate and money and finance. In addition, AOL is working to strengthen its already industry leading advertising platform by building own more advanced targeting capabilities. These upgrades will come through the integration of several recent acquisitions such as AdTech, Dakota, LighteningCast and Third Screen Media. All in all, we\u2019ve spend over $0.5 billion on acquisitions designed to extend AOL\u2019s advertising platform capabilities over the last 15 months. Along with Advertising.com, these acquisitions will help AOL to continue to have the leading third party display network worldwide and they will provide substantiate monetization benefits for AOL\u2019s owned and separated network sites as well. ", "We believe these initiatives to enhance our programming and products as well as our advertising platform are critical to the company\u2019s strong competitive position and its ability to drive increase long-term value. We will pursue these improvements even though they may result in somewhat less visibility into AOL\u2019s advertising growth trends in the near term. ", "I\u2019ll close by updating you on what we\u2019re doing on the capital allocation front. With the second quarter closing of Liberty Exchange, we essentially completed our $20 billion share repurchase program. In total, we repurchased over 1.1 billion shares, representing more than 23% of our outstanding shares at the start of the program, at an average price of $18.44 per share. ", "We remain committed to meaning a healthy leverage position of around three times OIBDA. Together, with our OIBDA growth and strong free cash flow generation, we have incremental capital to allocate. We\u2019re pleased to announce that our board has approved a new $5 billion stock repurchase plan. We believe buying Time Warner stock at current prices remains a very attractive use of our capital. We expect to utilize at least half of the new program by the time we report year end earnings in January. In addition, as we announced last week, we increased our existing dividend by almost 14%. Both the new repurchase program and higher dividend reflect our confidence in the sustainability of our strong operating performance going forward. ", "With that, I thank you again and I\u2019ll turn it over to Wayne to take you through the quarter. ", "Wayne Pace", "Thank you, Dick, and good morning to everyone. The slides that I\u2019ll refer to this morning are now available on our website. We\u2019ll start with a look at our second quarter results. Revenues increased 6% over the prior year to $11 billion. Adjusted OIBDA grew 20% to $3.1 billion and our second quarter margin increased 300 basis points to 28%, due primarily to lower expenses at AOL, the sales of AOL\u2019s European Internet access businesses and the shutdown of the WB Network. This was offset in part by cable whose margin was negatively impacted as expected by the acquisition of Adelphia. ", "Adjusted diluted EPS rose 16% to $0.22 for the quarter. If you move to the next slide, diluted EPS before discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting change was $0.25 in the quarter compared to $0.20 in 2006. Both years had items that affect comparability. ", "The current quarter included an approximate $100 million pre-tax gain from the sale of Time, Inc.\u2019s 50% ownership of Book Span and approximately $77 million of tax benefits that related primarily to the realization of tax attribute carry forward and the change of certain tax laws in states that affected our businesses. These items were principally offset by a $34 million non-cash charge relayed to the impairment of the Court TV trade name as a result of the network\u2019s rebranding initiative that we hope you have now heard about. These and other items are detailed in our earnings release and the trending schedules. Adjusting for these items, diluted EPS for the quarter increased $0.03 or 16%, to $0.22. ", "Looking at free cash flow, this slide shows the usual detail that we give you each quarter. Year-to-date through June we generated $2 billion in free cash flow and converted 33% of our adjusted OIBDA into free cash. We will be happy to discuss the details here during the Q&A, or call us after the call. ", "As the next slide shows, we ended the second quarter with net debt of $35 billion, up about $1.6 billion from the end of 2006. Contributing to the increase was $3.7 billion in share repurchase, which includes the Liberty transaction. As you recall, we exchanged the ownership interest in Atlanta Braves, Leisure Arts and approximately $960 million in cash for shares in Time Warner. In addition, approximately $400 million in dividend payments contributed to the increase in our net debt. ", "These increases were offset in part by net free cash flow of $2 billion, and net investment proceeds of $1.4 billion which included proceeds from the sale of AOL\u2019s German Internet access business and at publishing, the sales of The Parenting Group, most of the Time for Media titles and the company\u2019s investments in Book Span. ", "Finally, the net increase in net debt reflects $940 million of payments related to securities litigation and government investigations, which is captured in the other line item on this slide, resolving substantially all of our remaining securities litigation claims. Since June 30, Time, Inc. has closed on the sale of four Australian magazine titles and on the other side AOL announced the acquisition of Dakota, an online display of advertising network. ", "Once again, John Martin mentioned in Time Warner Cable\u2019s earnings call earlier this morning that Insight has announced that it is evaluating and exploring strategic alternatives and that Time Warner Cable is participating in this process. As John mentioned, we\u2019re unable to comment further on this process until it is completed. ", "This next slide highlights the completion of our share repurchase program. In summary, we have repurchased almost $20 billion of our stock, representing 23% of our outstanding shares since we began the program and at an average share price of $18.44 per share. As Dick mentioned to you a moment ago, our board has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase plan. Again, around our current share price levels, we expect to utilize approximately half of this authorization by the time we report year end earnings at the end of January of next year. ", "Also as Dick mentioned, we have reaffirmed our full year business outlook. We continued to expect full year OIBDA percentage growth to be in the mid to high teens off a 2006 base of $11 billion. We still expect to convert between 30% and 40% of adjusted OIBDA into free cash flow. ", "Additionally, we now anticipate earnings per diluted share for the full year to be approximately $1.07 which includes approximately $0.12 per diluted share related to the sales of assets and investments, certain tax benefits and expenses in the first six months related to the securities litigation and government investigations and the Court TV asset impairment charge I mentioned just a few moments ago. Our 2007 EPS guidance also reflects the impact from our share repurchase programs. ", "I\u2019ll spend the next few minutes on the results of our divisional segments and then we\u2019ll move to the Q&A with you. We\u2019ll start with AOL. Last August we announced a strategy to shift AOL\u2019s business to a primarily advertising-driven model. AOL\u2019s advertising revenues grew 16% in the second quarter due to growth on both the AOL network and partner sites. Display advertising on the AOL network increased 15% while page search on the AOL network was up 6%, and this reflects the one-year anniversary of our revised arrangement with Google. ", "Advertising on partner sites primarily done through Advertising.com rose 32%, and importantly, this increase reflected the first year anniversary of the expanded relationship with a major customer that began in the second quarter of last year. In the second half we\u2019re expecting advertising revenues to increase at a rate less than that experienced in the first half of 2007 and more if line with the growth rate achieved in the second quarter 2007 due to the shifting of advertising dollars from premium display to third-party networks. ", "Our subscription renews declined 55%. This reflects AOL\u2019s strategy to make AOL free which resulted in reduced acquisition marketing, and also subscribers turning or converting to free accounts. In addition, AOL subscription revenues were down approximately $400 million due to the previously announced sale of AOL\u2019s Internet access business in the UK, France and Germany. These declines in subscription revenues resulted in a 38 % decrease in total revenues for the second quarter. Adjusted OIBDA was down 2% compared to the prior year as lower revenues were offset by reductions in network and marketing costs. ", "This next slide highlights AOL\u2019s web metrics. For the second quarter, AOL\u2019s domestic ad revenue less traffic acquisition costs or TAC, was $329 million, up 12% year over year. Average monthly domestic unique visitors for the second quarter were 114 million, up compared to 111 million for the first quarter. Total domestic page views of approximately 52 billion rose 18% from the first quarter. As a result, AOL averaged 152 monthly page views per unique visitor in the second quarter. Page view growth in the current quarter included the impact of certain data tracking improvements which were implemented by comScore. If we were to exclude the impact of these data tracking improvements, it\u2019s our belief that page views grew approximately 4% as compared sequentially to the first quarter. ", "Domestic ad revenue less TAC per 1,000 page views of $6.32 for the quarter, which included the impact of Advertising.com\u2019s revenue generated on its partner sites, was 19% lower than the first quarter, due primarily to the data tracking improvements as well as the $19 million benefit from a change in the accounting estimate in the first quarter 2007. Please remember this $19 million item was discussed with you in last quarter\u2019s call. ", "Moving to cable. We\u2019re not going into too much detail here since Time Warner Cable reported its second quarter results earlier this morning, and as Dick said, we hope you had the opportunity to listen in on that call. Time Warner Cable\u2019s revenues increased 59% and its OIBDA grew 52%. As a reminder, these results reflect the impact of the acquisition of certain cable systems from Adelphia and Comcast on July 31, 2006 as well as the consolidation of the Kansas City pool on January 1 of this year. In looking at the second quarter 2000 results compared to the pro forma results for the second quarter of 2006, both revenues and OIBDA grew 9%. ", "This next slide shows cable subscriber highlights for the quarter. We\u2019ve provided you with additional disclosure in our earnings release detailing subscriber information for the acquired systems as well as the legacy systems. You can also access Time Warner Cable\u2019s earnings release, its business outlook release, earnings presentation and its call replay on its website. ", "Turning to film. Revenues declined 5% compared to the prior year due mostly to lower revenues from television products, to difficult comparison to the prior year\u2019s home video revenues, and a decrease in television licensing revenues on made for theatrical product. Please remember that the second quarter of 2006 included revenues from the second cycle syndication availability of Friends, the off network availability of the first three seasons of Without a Trace, and home video sales of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Offsetting these declines in part were worldwide theatrical revenues from Warner brothers Oceans 13 and 300. OIBDA decreased 24% driven by lower contribution from television product, as well as declines in theatrical product due mostly to higher theatrical pre-release print and advertising expenses. ", "As we had mentioned when we reported to you on the first quarter, our film slate is heavily weighted toward the second half of the year which includes the recent releases of Warner Brothers Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and New Line\u2019s Hairspray. They will be followed by the upcoming releases of Warner Brothers Fred Clause and I am Legend, as well as New Line\u2019s Rush Hour 3 and His Dark Materials, the Golden Compass. Also, please keep in mind that the second half of 2007 will include revenues from the initial off network availabilities Two-and-a-half Men and George Lopez in the third quarter, and Cold Case in the fourth quarter. So while OIBDA was down in the first half of the year, we expect the film segment OIBDA to be up significantly in the second half. As Dick mentioned overall, we expect results for the film segment to be up for the full year. ", "Moving on to networks. Revenues declined 1% reflecting the closing of the WB Network\u2019s operations in September of 2006, offset partly by higher subscription, and Turner advertising revenues. Subscription revenues grew 5% due primarily to higher rates and to a lesser extent an increase in subscribers at Turner. Driven by the absence of the WB Network, ad revenues declined 11%. Within these results, Turner\u2019s ad revenues increased 6% led by news and domestic entertainment. ", "The 10% increase in adjusted OIBDA was driven by the absence of The WB Network net losses incurred in the prior year quarter, and higher subscription and Turner advertising revenues. The prior year quarter included $81 million of shutdown costs related to the WB. ", "The adjusted OIBDA growth was offset partially by a 12% increase in programming costs at Turner and HBO, as well as $16 million of restructuring and severance charges at HBO in the current quarter. Before moving finally on to publishing, we want to comment on the network\u2019s OIBDA profile going forward. Due to the timing of programming and related marketing expenditures, we expect this segment to be flattish in the third quarter. ", "Lastly at publishing, revenues were essentially flat compared to the prior year, reflecting higher ad revenues which were offset by lower other revenues. The 1% increase in ad revenues was driven by higher digital revenues led by People.com and CNNMoney.com offset partially by lower print magazine revenues. OIBDA grew 12% as a result of lower restructuring charges and overall growth in non-magazine businesses and domestic magazines. ", "That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, we\u2019ll go back to Jim to start the Q&A. ", "James Burtson", "Thanks, Wayne. Operator, do we have any questions in the queue? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein. ", " Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Given that you used Google for paid search monetization, can you give more details on the slow down in search? Was the problem in number of queries and what are you doing that? ", "Second on display I realize compares become more difficult in the second half of the quarter with change in growth rates as the quarter moved along? ", "Jeff Bewkes ", "On the search first, I think the short answer is no to your question. But basically as Dick said, we reached the one-year anniversary of our improved Google which had gone into effect last year at the time. What we did during the quarter, basically in May, is we decluttered the search product to try to make it more attractive and drive higher engagement. As Dick said, it started May 10. That led to a brief change in traffic patterns as users tried to get use to it and also to a little bit of kind of wait and see on the ad side. But in the process of doing that, we refined the product and we have now returned at this point to the pre change monetization levels and we now have higher queries per unique as a result of it. That\u2019s essentially what happened to your question. ", "On the other question, which I look at as page views and display advertising overall, how things progressed during the quarter. Here\u2019s what really happened. I just want to expand on what Dick explained. Page views, we think, will grow on a year-over-year basis. In the second quarter, as Dick said to you, they grew sequentially already and that\u2019s for the first time since we started reporting this metric. ", "The reason -- and I think this really gets to what you\u2019re asking -- is that the comparisons in the second half in terms of what happened last year is that you had the page views dropping last year because of the reduction in paid subscribers, which as you know, occurred deliberately as we were changing the model to advertising. We essentially have progressively easier comparisons as we go along. ", "But even having said that, as we said we see page views going up sequentially now, we see equally importantly, engagement gains happening in key categories. Let\u2019s take email. Email we think is a very good leading indicator of overall usage. It was up 27% quarter to quarter at AOL in the second quarter, which is quite a bit more than what happened in email in the industry overall. ", "Finally, which is really clear to us, because we have this increasing registered user base, as Dick said, we now are up to 21.4 million total users. We\u2019ve got about 10.5 million free users, that\u2019s up 2.4 million to 2.5 million for the quarter. We have just shy of 11 million paying users. It\u2019s down 1.1 million during the quarter. So because you have that steadily increasing user base combined with the increases in engagement that we\u2019re seeing, we just see this as an improving situation. As we continue to upgrade the products, we\u2019ve done search, we\u2019ve now launched the new home page yesterday, we made changes in news and sports; upcoming we\u2019ve got real estate, money and finance. We see progress through the rest of the year, and more importantly we see setting a foundation for growth beyond that. ", " Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Then why change guidance? If you see improvement in paid search and all the metrics that you\u2019ve always watched are going the way you thought, then why change your outlook on advertising for the second half? ", "Jeff Bewkes ", "Well, because it\u2019s not clear exactly. We\u2019re going to be pretty close. We\u2019re just not sure exactly where it will be and we want to be free to make the investments and make these improvements as necessary, not be constrained by what we\u2019ve said about the guidance in terms of ad growth in the past. We just think that\u2019s important. We are not sure that we\u2019ll stay exactly inside the fence on it. We might, we might not. I don\u2019t mean to give a speech, but I guess I am giving a speech. ", "What we\u2019re interested in is improving the products to increase users and engagement, and that\u2019s the things we just said; home page is an important one. We\u2019re very interested and you\u2019re seeing this, as Dick mentioned it, in improving our monetization platform. That\u2019s a big deal. We really think as we add these capabilities, behavioral is the most recent with Dakota, we had AdTech for display advertising we bought back in May, we had LighteningCast for video ad serving, we bought Third Screen for mobile. We just think we\u2019re building a good platform there. ", "As the demand strengthens in third party, and you can see us picking up an advantage there, we had our third party growth rate which was 32% for the quarter. We just think the combination of those things are auspicious and we don\u2019t want to constrain ourselves too much with the guidance we came up with back when we were making pretty significant changes in the business model last year. ", "Richard Parsons", "This is my recollection. This is the first time in five years that we\u2019ve taken a step back on anything that we\u2019ve said that even approached guidance. So we said earlier in the year we thought AOL would grow, at least as rapidly in online ad space as the market did. ", " I\u2019ve always said we don\u2019t manage this company for the guidance. We manage the company according to business imperatives and for the long term growth and sustainability of our businesses. ", "What Jeff just talked to you about was, he has been working with the AOL management and as they\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to get this new strategic really embedded so it works over the long term, they decided they need to make some product improvements and tweak some of their position and offerings online that will create more momentum going forward. That creates some short-term turbulence. So we said let\u2019s not try and manage to a specific guidance metric we put out there, let\u2019s manage this company in a way that gives us all the greatest confidence we\u2019re creating value in the long run. ", "That\u2019s why we\u2019re just stepping back because we don\u2019t want people -- including inside the company \u2013 thinking they\u2019ve got to manage to some artificial metric as opposed to manage the business in a way that is in the long term business interest. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Spencer Wang \u2013 Bear Stearns. ", " Spencer Wang \u2013 Bear Stearns ", "I just have one big picture question for Dick and Jeff. As you look out over the next 12 to 18 months, how do you guys see the business portfolio of Time Warner changing? In that context if you could touch specifically on your ownership in Time Warner Cable, your ownership on AOL given Google demand registration rights and also the long run interest in keeping Time, Inc. within Time Warner? Thank you. ", "Richard Parsons", "We get asked this question every quarter. I don\u2019t really have much to add to what we\u2019ve said in the past so I guess what I\u2019ll do is repeat what we\u2019ve said in the past. Which is we like the cable business. We think we have the flexibility now given the structure of our cable company to participate, continue to participate in the ongoing consolidation of that space and business and we\u2019ve got a new currency that we can use in connection with that. So that\u2019s potentially a structural change, I wouldn\u2019t look for, however, something that was driven off of any impulse or initiative other than through the consolidation process within that timeframe you spoke about. ", "In terms of AOL, we remain confident -- and I\u2019ll let Jeff speak to this in a minute -- that we\u2019re on the right track. We think that the underlying metrics are telling us that AOL is in fact reasserting itself as a leader in the online advertising space, and we\u2019re doing the things that will cement that. The focus is on executing that strategy not for what some people may think is a creative or clever structural alternative. We don\u2019t think that should be the focus at this point in this time. ", "With respect to the publishing business, I\u2019ve said and say again, we were and are engaged in an ongoing process of pruning the portfolio to make sure we\u2019re focused on the titles, magazine space that have and can have life in the online space and we\u2019re focused on moving those brands into the online space and capturing the advertising dollars, leaving the print space and going into the online space. We think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job on that. That\u2019s where the focus is and will be over the next year to 18 months. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony Noto \u2013 Goldman Sachs. ", " Anthony Noto \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "My question is on AOL in two regards. First while I am on board with the strategy you\u2019ve embarked and the benefits you\u2019ll see from some of the programming changes going forward, the one thing that\u2019s really not in your control is the pricing pressure that you\u2019ve begun to see on the display inventory that I guess is probably legacy and this is due to advertiser\u2019s willingness to buy the lower-priced CPMs. How much more pressure do you think you could see on the CPM other than the high, premium placed advertising? ", "My second question is reversing the last question. Would you ever think about consolidating another larger portal within Internet space and just not to mince words, Yahoo!. Thanks. ", "Jeff Bewkes ", "Starting on the first one, in the area of monetization and price levels, we\u2019ll just follow up what we said before. As we improve the capabilities of our ad platform, including our third party ad platform, we can apply that to increased optimization and efficiency in our traffic generated at AOL itself. We think that will be an increasing ability to take efficiency in advertising and basically increase the dollar price or the yield in every one of the categories if you were looking at the growth in our categories. ", "Email, which we already mentioned we had gains in our AOL email up 27% in the quarter and that it was a good leading indicator, it outperformed the industry which is more like 9%. So email for us is now accounting for 43% of total page views. That\u2019s up from 41% just last quarter. Email, as everyone knows, has been a difficult thing to monetize up to now. But as you add some of the new monetization capabilities, including behavioral but not limited to that and there may be some other areas that we will add by either building or acquiring them, it will make our ability to monetize email go up. So to your question, we see the monetization future for us as steadily improving. ", "On swallowing or taking efficiency with other portals and those things. As Dick said it is a question we get asked and we should get asked every quarter. They are good questions because they\u2019re the same questions we ask ourselves internally. We obviously just look at those on a returns basis. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gordon Hodge \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners. ", " Gordon Hodge \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners ", "Just a couple question on filmed entertainment. I think you have some TV shows going on syndication in the second half of this year. I\u2019m wondering if you can refresh my memory on what that impact might be. Also, what the pipeline looks like for \u201808 in that area. If you could update us on the VOD test you\u2019re doing at Time Warner and Comcast and if any other studios are participating in your Time Warner Cable test. ", "Jeff Bewkes ", "On television, as Wayne said, in the second quarter we recognized the off net syndication revenue from the OC and from One Tree Hill. In the third quarter as I think you said, Wayne, we\u2019re going to be having the recognition for off network syndication on Two-and-a-half Men which is a big pretty show, and George Lopez. And in the fourth quarter, we expect that we\u2019ll take availability on Cold Case, that will go into syndication availability. ", "As you look ahead to 2008, we don\u2019t want to specify exactly which shows. Some of the things we\u2019re deciding as to when we put them in. In the end, we may not decide to put quite as much inventory, let\u2019s say, into availability in \u201808 as we had in \u201807. But we\u2019re not really ready to solidify that plan or announce what it is. ", "The VOD trials are actually encouraging and reasonably almost big news. Basically what we\u2019ve got when we do the trials, and we have some that are CW/Time Warner Cable specific and we have some with Comcast, is that the buy rates on video on demand rental over the electronic system, are up roughly 50%. The sell through, which is the point of the test, whether it eroded into sell through, did not go down. It actually went up a little bit; 5%, 10% depending on the test. Comcast had a similar report, I believe, in the part we shared with them. ", "The reason that happened on sell through is on the one hand it\u2019s not seeming to erode customer demand when people are taking it up on electronic VOD. What was happening before, or in the markets where you\u2019re not doing day and date, is if you think about it, the physical DVD\u2019s were running through the sell through process and then they were showing up at rental stores like Blockbuster as used inventory for sale, people were buying those which was cutting into the trial. ", "We think the test is pretty auspicious leads to what we have said publicly and around the industry is we think the whole industry should move and adopt this. It could be a very good source of growth, not just in revenue but also customer satisfaction and leading to increased margins. Because what the studios get out of electronic rental on VOD is about three times the margin that they get out of physical rental. So it\u2019s a good trade and it\u2019s easier for consumers. So it seems to be a win all the way around. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch. ", " Jessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch ", "I have a cable network question. Could you tell us about the upfront across your networks? Also, what kind of political advertising does CNN typically get or would you expect to get? On that flat Q3 guidance, is this increased spending on programming, is that also original programming. ", "Jeff Bewkes ", "I may have to follow up with you on that. Let\u2019s do the upfront and the ad sales. Basically the cable upfront, the cable industry for the networks overall is up about mid single-digits. Turner is leading the cable pack and we will be at the high end of that market, fueled mostly by our entertainment networks. So for example, we expect TBS and TNT to be up in the high single-digits to low double-digits. That\u2019s true both of pricing and of dollar volume because we kept the sell out basically roughly where it was. ", "The one area that\u2019s, well Court TV is also up significantly because it\u2019s had such a strong interest, at the high point of its ratings in the second quarter. The one weaker spot in the up front is the kids upfront which is pacing lower than the prior year. As a result, our Turner Network won\u2019t show improvement over the prior year. So overall it\u2019s a very strong story. We moved the scatter in the first and second quarter. It\u2019s been the same in the third quarter. ", "To your question on politics, the campaigns which is a good one, it seems that even as early as the end of this year, even though we\u2019re 15 months away, is kind of the beginning of this election. So that\u2019s brought some buoyancy into the ad spending environment, which absolutely benefits all of our networks but certainly including CNN. We don\u2019t break out separately what exactly we\u2019re doing on CNN in terms of dollars. But I would say in terms of ratings, it\u2019s the only news network that had double-digit gains among adults 25 to 54 in every hour from Monday through Friday 9 to 12. It had some strong points in the ratings side as well. ", "Richard Parsons", "On the third quarter, it was looking at the OIBDA for the networks for the third quarter where we said it would be flattish, it\u2019s as planned and it relates to, as you mentioned Jessica, original programming; some of it is entertainment, some of it is sports: basketball, baseball and NASCAR. It also reflects the marketing associated with that programming for the awareness of the enhanced programming we\u2019ve got, both at Turner and the Hollywood output at HBO. All as planned. You expect, on a going forward basis longer term, the type of growth at networks that you\u2019re accustomed to seeing. ", " Jessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch ", "Just one separate question on AOL, could you just discuss what\u2019s going on in the cost side? Is there any more room to cut costs on the network? ", "Jeff Bewkes ", "You know, we\u2019re on track to reduce costs by at least $1 billion by the end of 2007. Just to pick an example, in the second quarter, the network related cost, the physical transport and operation of the network, decreased by 80% meaning it\u2019s down to one-fifth of what it was a year ago. So we continue to make progress in cost cutting, which is why as Dick said, you see the profitability at AOL on a steady trend upward. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citigroup. ", " Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citigroup ", "DVD pricing over the last three quarters or so has been a high teens decline in DVD pricing you guys were reporting. Do you see those trends moderating at the $9 level or do you think there is another leg down? Secondly, is that an intentional effort to exploit price elasticity or is it the competitive nature of the business? ", "James Burtson", "The real thing you see in the industry in terms of price is actually just the weighted average math of current releases. It\u2019s mixed. You\u2019ve got what is obviously a very strong year in terms of box office going on, a lot of the biggest titles are just coming out or still to come out as the year goes on as new releases. Those, you\u2019ve been relying more on catalog in terms of pricing where you have seen pricing pressure over the last couple years but it\u2019s nowhere near I think the magnitude when you get down to the individual, what the retail pricing is per product, you\u2019re talking about in terms of 19%. That\u2019s the result of a mix shift. You\u2019ll see that I think change as the year goes on and I think you\u2019re going to see a very strong fourth quarter across the industry in terms of home video. ", " Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citigroup ", "As more new releases and less library, did I interpret that. ", "James Burtson", "Exactly, as the big titles come out. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Imran Khan \u2013 JP Morgan. ", " Imran Khan \u2013 JP Morgan ", "The first question is specific to Mapquest, I was wondering if you looked at the competition in the landscape Google and Yahoo! and Microsoft investing heavily to drive the traffic investment of their product, what are you doing to drive the product and drive the traffic, maintaining the traffic growth on Mapquest? ", "Jeff Bewkes ", "I don\u2019t know specifically what we\u2019re doing in product improvements at Mapquest right now. ", "Richard Parsons", "Traffic overall I think has generally trended up with Mapquest for us. It still has the leading share in terms of mapping and directions. The product has upgraded pretty significantly over the last several months and will continue to do so. I think if you look at it from a traffic standpoint the bigger thing that AOL is doing across it\u2019s programming is better circulation of the traffic and more movement, natural movement of users from one product to another and doing it in a way that doesn\u2019t force them to do but that highlights the products and gives them a convenient option to do so. Traffic overall and their share of that market has actually remained remarkably consistent despite improvement and products at the competitors. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Eagan - Oppenheimer. ", " Tom Eagan \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Jeff following up on comments you made before in on-demand, is it not the case with the day and date trials, have you seen a pull back in the retail rental? You can see positives in DVDs or pull back in retail rental. ", "On the on-demand advertising, when are we going to see the investment that needs to be made whether it\u2019s in the on-demand servers or in choosing some kind of industry wide metrics so you can compare across the board? ", "Jeff Bewkes ", "First of all, yes, the one area where the successful and auspicious increase in VOD buy through has hurt physical sell through, it has hurt physical rental a little bit. That\u2019s economically a good thing for most of the participants like the major DVD retailers, for the studios, it\u2019s good for the networks in maintaining audience on their VOD channels because if you heard Brian this morning, these new VOD systems allow you to go from the channel so you\u2019re watching TNT off to video on demand, then get back, return to the channel. ", "Shifting to your question on advanced advertising, it enables increasingly the cable platform to refresh the advertising as you\u2019re using video on demand so that you can have time specific ads for movie releases and so forth. ", "Your question is really a good one on the common data and interfaces for the ad platform. I think the industry is moving rapidly to put in the servers and lay this all out. It\u2019s not a large technical problem at all to agree on common data that can then be used for national sales. That\u2019s underway right now. I think it will get agreed and installed steadily over the next year or two. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley. ", " Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "A question on cable networks. Can you assess what domestic advertising growth was at the networks in the quarter? Are there any changes that you would like to make in terms of commercial loading on the networks or the pods going forward, given what looks like the shift from program ratings to commercial ratings, that better positions Turner relative to its competitors? ", "Jeff Bewkes ", "Going forward, the general consensus is that the third quarter ad revenue for the industry will be up around 5%, mid singles. As we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve been doing in our upfront better than the average in the cable industry. At this point we expect to continue doing that. To your point on the pods, I must admit, I have no idea what you\u2019re asking. ", "James Burtson", "The way units are sold in the upfront. We sold generally a live bus with commercial rating minutes, so do we alter the advertising dramatically again. ", "Jeff Bewkes ", "No. ", "James Burtson", "For the quarter Turner was up 6%.

Welcome to Time Warner\u2019s 2007 thirdquarter earnings conference call. This morning we issued two press releases:one detailing our third quarter results and the other re-affirming our 2007business outlook.", "Before webegin there are several items I need to cover. First, we refer to non-GAAPmeasures, including operating income before depreciation and amortization, orO-EBIDTA, and free cash flow. We use these measures when we analyzeyear-over-year comparisons.

We appreciate your joining us today on ourthird quarter earnings call. Here is our agenda for this morning. First, asusual, I\u2019ll share my perspective on where the company stands and where we\u2019reheaded. Next, our CFO, Wayne Pace, will take you through the results for thequarter. After that, Jeff Bewkes, who as you all know by now will become ourCEO in the new year, will help us answer your questions. ", "Let me startby setting out for you what I believe are the three main take-aways for thequarter. The first is that, with nine months of the year behind us, Time Warneris squarely on track to achieve its full-year business outlook and will be wellpositioned for 2008. The second take-away is that we\u2019re targeting sustainable,double-digit EPS growth as we look out into the next year. The third, similarto last quarter, we\u2019re continuing to invest in AOL for sustainable long-termgrowth and value creation. I\u2019ll expand on each of these three points as I gothrough the quarter\u2019s results.

", "Overall,triple play penetration now stands at 15%, up almost 2 more percentage pointssince last we reported earnings. Although its operating results have been somewhathampered by the turnaround divisions of L.A. and Dallas, we\u2019re pleased with theprogress that Time Warner Cable is making, as well as the competitive positionthat they maintain.

This very healthy growth was driven bythe theatrical releases of Warner Brothers\u2019 HarryPotter and the Order of the Phoenix and Ocean\u2019sThirteen and New Line\u2019s Rush Hour 3and Hairspray. This success wasaugmented by strong home video results, which included the successfulworld-wide release of Warner Brothers\u2019 300.", "As we\u2019ve toldyou, we anticipate that our filmed entertainment reporting line will be up forthe full year.

O-EBIDTA rose 6%, which is more than we were expecting giventhe timing of planned investments in programming and marketing at Turner andHBO. This greater than anticipated growth was fuelled by 10% higher advertisingrevenues at Turner, which benefited from both ratings improvements and ahealthy scatter market.

Included in thatexpectation was adjusted O-EBIDTA being down for the third quarter. Advertisingrevenue rose 13% in the quarter. Breaking down these results we see the splayrecorded weaker 6% growth than the 15% regenerated last quarter.

On the monetization front, AOL\u2019s management team isworking to integrate the advertising capabilities that we\u2019ve acquired over thelast year to create the leading full-service platform for onlineadvertisements.

Wayne became CEOof this company in January, on January 1st, 2002. It is not overstatement to say that the six years he hasserved in that position have been some of the most challenging and turbulentfor corporate America in general,and for this company in particular, in memory.

Adjusted O-EBIDTA grew 15%to $3.2 billion. Our third quarter margin increased approximately 150 basispoints over the prior year to 28% due mainly to lower expenses at AOL and thesales of AOL\u2019s European internet access businesses. Also, adjusted diluted EPSrose 26% to $0.24 for the quarter.", "Moving to thenext slide. Diluted EPS before discontinued operations and the cumulativeeffect of an accounting change was $0.24 in the quarter, and that\u2019s compared to$0.33 in 2006. As a reminder, the prior year included pre-tax investment gainsand they related mostly to the sale of our interest in Time Warner Telecom andthe tax benefit from our ability to recognize net operating loss carry forwardsunder generally accepted accounting principles requirements. These amounts wereoffset in part by an impairment charge that we took to reduce the carryingvalue of the WB network\u2019s good will. These and other items are detailed in ourearnings release and the trending schedules that we have provided to you.", "Adjusting forthese prior year items, diluted EPS increased 5%, or $0.05 or 26% compared tothe prior year quarter reflecting higher adjusted O-EBIDTA and our loweroutstanding share count, offset partly by an expected increase in bothdepreciation and interest expenses related to the Adelphia and Comcasttransactions and the impact of our share repurchase program on our outstandingdebt balances.", "Turning tothe next slide on free cash flow. Through the first nine months of the year wegenerated $4 billion in free cash flow and converted 42% of our adjustedO-EBIDTA into free cash. This slide shows the usual detail that we give youeach quarter. The variation in the working capital line item that you see hereis primarily timing on collections for home video receivables and timing onpayments for accounts payable. ", "Moving to thenext slide. As it shows, we ended the third quarter with net debt of $35.3billion. That\u2019s up $1.9 billion from the end of 2006. Reflected in thisincrease was $5.7 billion in share repurchases and $645 million in dividendpayments. Also included was approximately $920 million of payments related tosecurities litigation and government investigations. These items were offsetpartly by the $4 billion of free cash flow and we had $1.8 billion of netinvestment proceeds which included proceeds from the sales of AOL\u2019s Germaninternet access business and is Tegic Communications business.

And in addition, at the beginning of Augustwe announced that our board authorized a new $5 billion share repurchaseprogram. Under that new program we repurchased to date $2.2 billion or 119million shares at an average price per share of $18.64. We continue to expect,based on current price levels, to utilize at least half of this authorizationby the time we report our year-end earnings.", "As Dick alsomentioned, we have re-affirmed our full-year business outlook. We continue toexpect full-year adjusted O-EBIDTA percentage growth to be in the mid to highteens of the base of $11 billion and to convert between 30% and 40% of adjustedO-EBIDTA into free cash flow.", "We alsocontinue to anticipate earnings per diluted share for the full year to be approximately$1.07, which includes approximately $0.12 per diluted share related to thesales of assets and investments, certain tax benefits, expenses in the firstnine months related to the securities litigation and in governmentinvestigations, and the Court TV asset impairment charge.

I want to, I have two only that are interrelated, whichis, what are you seeing in the fourth quarter that gives you the sense thatgrowth will slow in AOL advertising?

We want to build the monetization platform and we want to buildthat monetization both for owned and operated inventory and for third-partypublishers. So we really ought not to lose sight of the fact that, let\u2019s justgo to what Wayne went into indetail and what Dick had in his comments. There were some bright spots in thethird quarter on AOL advertising. Particularly the strong 21% growth in partnersite third-party revenues. And we had a rebound in search. But it is true thatthe display growth in advertising is not at the level that we\u2019re targeting forthe longer term. ", "And so whywas that? Well, some of it was due to changes in programming. In other words,we had some things in AOL that weren\u2019t really profitable or part of what wethink is the future strategy. Things like Gold Rush, some commerce deals. Wetook those out. But we also changed, and continue to do this in order toimprove AOL, some of the programming categories. We changed the home page. Wechanged the news, sports, money finance page, music, shopping.

The fact that we haven\u2019tsort of gone after everything that\u2019s moved in our space has been the result ofthe fact that we\u2019ve looked at it and made a judgement that it either didn\u2019t fitor didn\u2019t have the kind of return characteristics or was overpriced or whateverthat, and therefore, we have refrained.

Remember, we\u2019ve put ADTECH on top ofthat for display ad serving. Lightningcast for video ad serving. Third ScreenMedia for mobile. TACODA for behavioural. And now Quigo for contextual. So thatis a very robust part of our business. ", "You had aquestion on search. Did you understand the question? ", "James E. Burtson", "Yeah. John,it\u2019s James. The disclosure in the cue relates to partly on regarding the searchrelates to just comparisons we think we\u2019re phasing as we come through thefourth quarter. The actual metric, I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re looking at in termsof the media metrics or core metrics, but on the query volume and things likethat they actually were up very strongly year over year as we parsed thenumbers. So I don\u2019t necessarily think that it\u2019s an underlying volume issue.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "And on thetelevision network side, I think you\u2019re correctly said that broadcast ratingswere a little bit down. Cable share viewing was off as Turner, when Dick said,we had pretty strong ad growth at 10% up for the quarter. We\u2019re doing well andfairly strong support both in up front from before and in scatter. And giventhe positions of our networks, TNT at number one in total day and some of thekey adult demos, TBS number two in 18-34, and some very strong, very important,as we\u2019ve said, over many quarters a regional programming franchise is gettingstarted at Turner from The Closer toHolly Hunter\u2019s show Saving Grace. Andthen at TBS we have two new sitcoms -- Houseof Payne and The Bill Engvall Show\u2013 are the two top as-supported cable original sitcoms involved. That\u2019s on topof Adult Swim continuing its verystrong performance with young audiences. ", "So I thinkyou asked about the ad climate and how it affects us. Answer, good. And ourperformance within it is even better.", "James E. Burtson", "Thanks,Jonathan. If we could move to the next question.", "Operator", "Thank you.Next, Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Anthony Noto \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank youvery much. Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk about your member base atAOL, paid and free, in 2007 will be a year of growth of paid and free members.As we go into 2008 do you think there\u2019s enough additional free members that youcan acquire to offset what you\u2019ll lose in the paid side so that you actuallyhave total member growth in 2008? ", "Secondquestion I have is, on the display side, 6% year-over-year growth versus 15%last quarter. You attributed the deceleration mostly to sort of usage on thesite. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the weighted averagemix of CPMs. Are you still seeing CPM pressure just from the industrytransformation into lower price CPM inventory? Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "All right.First is, I guess, registered users and members. The answer is, they\u2019re goingup. When we announced AOL going from paid to free we had 18.5 million roughlypaying subs. That had been declining as you all know. We\u2019re now up over, youdisclosed? Over 25 in free users.So we got a lot more users or registered users today than we did then. We\u2019rehaving most of the people, the great majority who go from paid subscribermember access over to broadband are keeping and using AOL. That\u2019s going up. Wethink it will go up again next year. And it\u2019s the reason why the patrons whichhad been declining are now stabilizing and we believe will begin to increase.So that\u2019s, I hope, what you were looking for on that question. ", "James E. Burtson", "The nextquestion, which was on display. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "So what yougot there. It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s a little on the complicated side. There ispressure on pricing out in the general online ad world to one extent becausesome of the inventory or some of the buying pressure wants to move from whatwere \u201cpremium\u201d environment buys over into performance targetable and measurablebuys. And so that does affect, as people look for that, some of the pricing.Having said that, as you saw in our disclosure, our kind of RPMs went up.That\u2019s an interaction of how we dealt with inventory and, frankly, one of thethings which I, in my first very long-winded answer to Michael\u2019s question, whenwe said we\u2019re working and changing what we\u2019re doing in ad, in our salesprocess, we have to and we are getting much more conscious and focused on howwe assign or move inventory between premium sales, what used to be the AOLowned and operated handling of the inventory, over to performance sales throughthe third party platform or the performance optimization platform. Sothat\u2019s  a key skill that our company andthe other companies we compete with are honing and it\u2019s part of what we intendto improve.", "Anthony Noto \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thankyou.", "James E. Burtson", "Thanks,Anthony. Operator, we can move to the next question.", "Operator", "Thank you.Next, Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is open.", "Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks. Justone question on AOL. Presumably some portion of the paid AOL members are trulyusing AOL for access. I guess my question is, has your view changed in terms ofthe number of sort of permanent AOL dial-up subs that are using it for access?When do you think we hit that point where you sort of, you know, milked orcompleted most of the migration that\u2019s under way right now?", "James E. Burtson", "Hi, Jason.It\u2019s Jim. It\u2019s hard. The answer to your question, it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s ahard one to answer in the sense that the subscribers actually, in terms of theattrition of them has obviously been flattening out. The makeup of their use ismultiband for the most part. So the vast majority of them use broadband and usenarrowband or some, you know, the question is how much of each. It\u2019s just veryhard for us to say how many of them actually rely on AOL for their access tothe internet on an absolute basis. Or on a very precise basis. I\u2019m not tryingto be evasive to your question. I\u2019m not sure we actually know the answer tothat. I would just say that so far I think we\u2019ve been pleased with the trendsin terms of the net losses and that they are, as you\u2019ve been able to see,flattening out.", "Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. Thankyou very much.", "James E. Burtson", "Thank you,Jason. Can we move to the next question, Operator?", "Operator", "Thank you.Spencer Wang of Bear Stearns. Your line is open.", "Spencer Wang \u2013 Bear Stearns", "Thanks. Iguess this is a question for Jeff. Jeff, as you move, at AOL as you move moreof your premium inventories through Advertising.com, what\u2019s the net impact yourseeing on pricing? Is that actually helping or hurting pricing for thatinventory?", "Secondly, onAOL margins you\u2019ve seen a big uplift during the kind of mid to high 30% arearight now. How much higher do you think that can go and over what time frame?Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, I thinkthe margins can go up. That question first. On the first one it\u2019s a littlecomplicated because it depends which inventory. I mean, if you take certainmodule inventory that should have gone to performance and you leave it in\u201cpremium\u201d brand environment selling you can put downward pressure on the priceof that category. That\u2019s why I was trying to say and it is a skill that ourcompetitors and we are building all the time. It\u2019s figuring out which goeswhere and what\u2019s the most efficient way to use the premium inventory and what\u2019sthe most efficient way to use the performance capability that we\u2019re building. ", "James E. Burtson", "And Spence,the only thing I would add to that is, part of what Jeff is getting at in termsof the inventory management is actually shifting inventory over to yourquestion which would capture the demand. So if there is lower demand bydefinition, particularly I would argue for the non-premium inventory at theportals because that\u2019s available at the networks and the performance networks.Then you\u2019re certainly no worse off by moving that inventory over to where thedemand actually is.", "Spencer Wang \u2013 Bear Stearns", "Right. Okay. ", "James E. Burtson", "Thanks,Spencer. Operator, if we could move to the next question.", "Operator", "Thank you.Next, Rich Greenfield, Pali Capital. Your line is open.", "Richard Greenfield \u2013 Pali Capital", "Hi. Aquestion for Jeff. Dick has historically talked about Time Warner Cable and ifyou were to reduce your ownership that it likely would be through some form ofM&A activity in terms of owning less of more. Do you feel differently thanDick does about how you might reduce your ownership and whether you really wantto keep it at the current levels other than through M&A. ", "And then,too, just on the issue of the slowdown and display while you still have decentgrowth in your third party. Could you just discuss or view the relative marginsthat you see on those two business and is there anything that really gives youcomfort that display will actually have growth in 2008? Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, firstof all, I\u2019d like to thank you for all the suggestions you\u2019ve been offering overthe past month. We appreciate that. Secondly, good questions. So the marginsare lower on some of the third party efficiency performance ads, as you know.So I\u2019m not sure what more I can tell you about that. Do you have a better senseof the question?", "James E. Burtson", "Well, they\u2019relower for the third party, but they\u2019re not lower when for the AOL inventory.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "No, no. Notthe AOL ones. Correct. So, I hope that answered that question. ", "The other oneon what Dick and I think and what does the company think on what we\u2019re going todo with our interest in cable and how to deal with it going forward. We, Ithink as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s not really appropriate for us to describe our viewnow. So we obviously are aware \u2013 you know, it\u2019s interesting as you read all thecommentary you can get advice in almost every direction. We\u2019re obviously awareof it all. We\u2019ll consider it and make decisions in due course. We can\u2019t reallysay what we\u2019re going to do at this point.", "Richard Greenfield \u2013 Pali Capital", "I only askedthe question because Dick was very specific in kind of talking about the termsof less of more strategy historically and I just wanted to get a sense ofwhether you saw a difference or a potential for change from that looking out. ", "Richard D. Parsons", "Actually,Rich, what I said many times, at least as I recall as many times, was that oneof the reasons for going to the structure where we had severally structuredcable companies, on one hand it gave us currency to do transactions in a worldthat I think is going to continue to consolidate. And therefore, thepossibility to own less of a bigger thing was there. But also, that cable ismigrating in a direction to become a sort of fully robust telecommunicationsplatform and at some point in time the requirements of the balance sheet forthat kind of business might require us to separate the two because of conflictbetween what a telecommunications platform needs in terms of a balance sheetand the proper structure of it and what a content company needs. ", "So we\u2019vetalked to both sides of the equation and what Jeff is just saying is this isobviously a dynamic world and he\u2019s going to have to sort of figure out how bestto sort of play his cards as the world unfolds.", "Richard Greenfield \u2013 Pali Capital", "Very helpful.Thanks. ", "James E. Burtson", "Thanks, Rich.Operator, can we move to the next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you.Next is Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks fortaking the question. Good morning, guys. I just want to go back and ask probablythe 30th question on AOL. But when I look at the asset base you\u2019veput together there you can sort of carve it out between technology assets andcontent assets. And your growth on the third party side where you\u2019re reallygetting bigger with Quigo and TACODA is in obviously stark contrast to what\u2019shappening on the content portal websites. Are these two businesses sort ofrequired to be together or do you look at these as two assets that couldpotentially be split apart down the road? I\u2019m asking the question in thecontext of, Jeff, as you take over going forward how you might look atreshaping the portfolio in \u201908 and beyond.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, onething I just want to quibble in the \u201cstark\u201d contrast. There\u2019s some realstrength and strong brands and strong performance with audiences on the AOLowned and operated and context sites of AOL. We do right also if we\u2019re buildingand have a very, you know, trumpeted position in third party performance netplatform. So that\u2019s all true. They work pretty well to help each other, whichis true at companies like Yahoo as well, but you know, your question iscertainly an understandable one and we want to be flexible to capture the valueon both sides. As the industry moves along we find the current structure workswell to do that and so, you know, we\u2019re aware of that question, but at thispoint we like our position and the kind of organizational abilities that we arebuilding inside AOL and on the third party side. ", "Ben Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thankyou. ", "James E. Burtson", "Thanks, Ben.Operator, if we could take one more question, please.", "Operator", "All right.Thank you. Tuna Amobi, S&P Equity Group. Your line is open.", "Tuna Amobi \u2013 S&P Equity Group", "Thank youvery much. First, Dick, I want to congratulate you on the contributions you\u2019vemade over the past couple of years and wish you the very best for the nextchapter of your life. ", "I wanted toask about your commentary on the double-digit earnings growth, which I don\u2019tthink I\u2019ve heard before in the context of a long-term perspective. If you canperhaps explain how you see that metric excluding Time Warner Cable. Does thatdouble-digit outlook have a lot to do with your outlook for the cable divisionor do you still see that being the case with or without the cable?", "Next would befor Jeff.  Jeff, I wanted to get yoursense, I know you won\u2019t talk about structurally what the company might looklike, but under your stewardship can you comment perhaps on any similarities ordifferences in terms of your management style, operating philosophy, centralization/decentralization,etcetera? ", "And if I canfollow up with AOL, I know there\u2019s been a lot of questions already, but I wasjust curious on what might have caused the deceleration in the US web metricsthat you describe. It\u2019s not like a month ago. The trends there were healthywhen you talked about the verticals, the unbundling strategy. I was just kindof curious if those unbundling metrics that you\u2019re tracking are still trendingwell for the long-term given the comments that you made. Thank you very much.", "Richard D. Parsons", "That\u2019s a heckof a last question, Tuna, but let me start by saying thank you for the generousremarks. I appreciate that. ", "Secondly,what I said in my remarks were we are confident of double-digit earnings growthin terms of earnings per share growth in \u201908 and beyond. I said the period ofour long-term plan. And that\u2019s something both Wayne and Jeff and I have talkedabout and looked at and I wouldn\u2019t have said it if we didn\u2019t have confidencearound it. I will tell you that that\u2019s based on the current long-term plan, thebudget for next year and the long-term plan, which includes and does notexclude the cable. As we go forward one of Jeff\u2019s challenges will be to sort offigure out how to keep us in that zone because we think that\u2019s the zone thatultimately investors expect and ultimately will be rewarded by the market placegiven the other opportunities that he has to look at the assets and deploy themin ways that may be different than the way they\u2019re deployed now. But that wasnot included in my comments or that was not anticipated in my comments. Mycomments were based on Time Warner as we know it today and our plan and budgetand long-term thinking about that collection of assets.", "Tuna Amobi \u2013 S&P Equity Group", "Okay. That\u2019sfair enough.", "Richard D. Parsons", "Thanks. Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I thinkyou\u2019ve said it. ", "Richard D. Parsons", "No, but hehad a bunch of other questions.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Oh. ", "Tuna Amobi \u2013 S&P Equity Group", "The questionwas on the management style of similarities and differences, Jeff, between youand Dick. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Oh, I don\u2019tknow. I really don\u2019t know how to answer that. ", "Richard D. Parsons", "He\u2019s smarterthan I am, Tuna.", "Tuna Amobi \u2013 S&P Equity Group", "I was justtrying to get a sense of are you more of a decentralization guy or more of ahands on, I know you\u2019ve been deeply involved with AOL, so I\u2019m just trying toget a sense now that you\u2019re going to be running the total company, are yougoing to decentralize more of the day-to-day responsibilities at AOL and so onto the other divisions? ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We\u2019ve beendoing it, I\u2019ve been doing it. So we, here\u2019s what it is. We basically have apretty lively debate and we, which is not to say that we\u2019re down in the weeds,but we believe in a pretty, this company has to move fast. The world ischanging fast. It\u2019s going digital, it\u2019s going global. Inside the United Statessome of the key audiences for our media properties, if you look at the youngerpeople they\u2019re more multicultural than the old 50, 60, 70-year-old audience. Sowe therefore need to adapt all of our products, our journalist, or how we offerthem the kind of advances in community and communication that go along witheditorial and entertainment products. And all of that requires a lot of trialand error, a lot of healthy debate, quick movement, and it requires us to beable to change course. So we\u2019ve got kind of an open, ongoing discussion isessentially how we manage the company.", "James E. Burtson", "And Tuna, ifit\u2019s all right, I\u2019m going to take your question on the specific usage metricsoff line.

Morgan", "Operator", "Hello and welcome to the Time Warner fourth quarter 2007 earnings call. (Operator Instructions) Now I will turn the call over to James Burtson, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's 2007 full year and fourth quarter earnings conference call. This morning, we issued two press releases -- one detailing our results for the 2007 full year and fourth quarter and the other providing our 2008 business outlook. ", "Before we begin, there are several items I need to cover. First, we refer to non-GAAP measures, including such measures as operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA, and free cash flow. We use these measures when we analyze year-over-year comparisons. ", "In order to enhance comparability, we eliminate certain items, such as non-cash impairments, gains or losses from asset disposals, and amounts related to securities litigation and government investigations. We call this measure adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization, or adjusted OIBDA. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to operating income and cash provided by operations or the other most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as applicable are included in our earnings release or trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on the company\u2019s website at www.timewarner.com/investors. A reconciliation of our expected future financial performance is also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. ", "Second, as a result of the sales of the parenting group, most of the Time4 Media titles, The Progressive Farmer magazine, Leisure Arts, the Atlanta Braves baseball franchise, Tegic Communications and Wildseed, the company has presented the operating results for these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The 2006 operating results of Time Warner Book Group and the Turner South Network, as well as cable systems transferred to Comcast in the Adelphia/Comcast transaction, are reflected as discontinued operations as well. ", "Third, you\u2019ll see a section in our earning release that sets out a description of the basis of presentation for Time Warner Cable\u2019s results. Today we refer to certain pro forma financial results for Time Warner Cable. The pro forma financial information for full year 2006 presents the results as if the Adelphia and Comcast transactions and the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool had occurred on January 1, 2006. The pro forma financial information for the fourth quarter of 2006 presents the results as if the consolidation of the Kansas City Pool had occurred on January 1, 2006. Reconciliations of the pro forma financial information to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP are included in the trending schedules posted on the company\u2019s website. ", "Finally, today\u2019s announcement includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations or beliefs and is subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by the statements herein due to changes in economic, business, competitive, technological, strategic, and/or regulatory factors. ", "More detailed information about these factors may be found in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation to and in fact expressly disclaims any such obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. ", "With that covered, I\u2019ll thank you and turn the call over to Jeff. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Good morning, everyone. This is my first earnings call as CEO and the start of what I intend to be a straightforward, ongoing dialog with you. I\u2019ll tell you as much as I can about where we are planning to take Time Warner. ", "Our goal is to increase the value of the company and its stock price on a sustainable, long-term basis and to do that, we have to succeed in three missions. One, operating our businesses with better performance and returns than competitors in the short-term and the long-term. Two, we have to have the right businesses and the right structure and three, we need to manage our balance sheet and deploy capital to the right places, including when appropriate directly to our shareholders. ", "Pretty much everything we do will be focused on one of these three missions. Let me start with how we\u2019ll run our businesses. ", "We are working from a good position. As you know, most of our businesses are number one in their sectors but the danger of prior success for us is complacency and we can\u2019t afford that. We need to increase our current margins and profitability by better managing our costs, among other things. And on the cost side, we are going to do that across the company. ", "And to set the right tone, we are starting here at corporate where we are implementing immediately an initial round of cost reductions of over 15%, thereby reducing our run-rate at corporate by more than $50 million a year. ", "The other place we\u2019ve identified for near-term cost cuts is New Line Cinema. We know from experience that there\u2019s real value in New Line as an independent label and brand with its own slate of movies and New Line\u2019s had great success with certain genres of films that are not historically in the sweet spot of large studios, particularly one like Warner\u2019s, that appeals to really broad audiences all over the world. ", "But with the recent trend toward fewer movie releases across the industry and given the greater importance of overseas revenues, there\u2019s the obvious question about whether it still makes sense for us to have two completely separate studio infrastructures at Warner and New Line. So we are reviewing how to operate New Line more efficiently and we expect to take action here fairly soon. ", "As we go forward, corporate and New Line won\u2019t be the only places where we reduce costs and as it is often said, managing costs isn\u2019t a one-time initiative. It\u2019s a way of doing business. That\u2019s true but cutting costs only goes so far and we have to innovate and invest in the future of our businesses at the same time. ", "So let\u2019s look at our operating segments. I\u2019ll start with the studios, networks, and publishing taken together. They are all leaders in content creation, packaging, distribution, and branding and they all require constant expansion of these brands and the content, including in the digital area. ", "Long-term success in these businesses always depends on the ability to make compelling content but increasingly, it will hinge on finding new ways for consumers to use and enjoy the content wherever, whenever, and however they want to do that. ", "So contrary to some, we see all these new forms of digital distribution as great opportunities for these content businesses, and we\u2019ve had some important early wins in digital, like HBO\u2019s breakthrough success with video-on-demand, CNN\u2019s global lead on the Internet, and Time Warner Cable\u2019s on-demand start-over initiatives. ", "But frankly, I think we and others in the industry need to be a bit more revolutionary than evolutionary in this area. For some time, I\u2019ve had the strong belief that all linear ad supported networks should make their programming lineups on-demand and on television sets, not just on broadband. It\u2019s a win-win for consumers and networks alike. ", "So we\u2019re going to be aggressive in putting our own networks on demand so we can show the industry the benefits of this model. We think it will cement the long-term prospects of these businesses. ", "Now let me talk about AOL, which you all know is undergoing a significant business model transition from a declining ISP subscription business to a growing Internet ad business. By and large, this transition, which took off when AOL began offering its service for free in August of 2006, has been successful. The vast majority of AOL subscribers who switched to free have maintained their usage. And now we\u2019ve stabilized page views and we are working hard to grow usage on AOL's network of websites. ", "And despite switching to free service, AOL has maintained a substantial base of profits and this is no small feat. It\u2019s grown its earnings during this transition. We have substantially reduced the operating expenses at AOL by well over $1 billion in the past 12 months alone. ", "But at the same time, while we\u2019ve been actively reducing the costs and redesigning AOL's historic business, we\u2019ve been investing in new higher growth segments of the online industry. ", "Last year we invested over $900 million in capital to assemble important additional pieces of Platform-A, which you all know is our leading scale display monetization platform and it now includes not only advertising.com but TACODA and Quigo and a number of other recent important additions. ", "Looking forward, we\u2019re just trying to grow our customer usage and extend the competitive position of our advertising platform. Doing these two things should allow us to take advantage of the continuing growth in online advertising. ", "At the same time, we need to complete AOL's business model transition, so we are working on separating AOL's access and audience businesses so we can run them independently. This should significantly increase AOL's strategic options for each of these main business sectors. ", "Now let\u2019s talk about Time Warner Cable. The business has strong growth prospects in its existing residential business. You heard a lot about that this morning. And now it will add further growth by serving small- to medium-sized commercial customers. ", "Cable is also working to combine the targeting abilities of the Internet with the impact of television advertising. ", "The business clearly generates increasing returns because most of the capital spent is tied to new revenue. But Cable does require a consistent level of ongoing capital investment to drive revenue growth. ", "In many ways, Cable has a very different business profile from our other businesses. And in addition, it also appears that our current ownership structure with Time Warner owning about 84% of Time Warner Cable and with only 16% of its common equity owned by the public, is less than optimal for both companies. ", "So we are initiating direct discussions with their management and their separate board of directors regarding our ownership in Time Warner Cable. We expect to reach a decision on whether and how to change our ownership level by our first quarter earnings report at the end of April. ", "Nobody should think that we\u2019ve lost faith in Cable\u2019s business prospects. Quite the opposite. We think it is undervalued -- substantially undervalued. But it doesn\u2019t follow necessarily from that an optimistic view that Time Warner Cable is best-positioned in its current ownership structure within Time Warner. ", "So we\u2019ve talked about operating improvements and structural changes. Now let me tell you how we are managing the balance sheet. As I see it, we have to do two things very well. First, make sure we maintain healthy leverage while we also maintain an investment grade rating. Second, we have to put our capacity to work in areas that generate the best returns for shareholders. We will constantly evaluate investment opportunities across our businesses within this framework and balance that against returning capital directly to the shareholders. ", "Summing up, we are going to push for better margins, including by more aggressively managing costs. We are going to move faster to capitalize on emerging opportunities for our businesses. We are working to separate AOL's access business from its higher growth audience, communications, community and ad platform businesses, and we are starting a formal process to resolve our ownership of Time Warner Cable. ", "I look forward to reporting progress on these fairly soon and I encourage you to keep a close watch on us. ", "Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, John Martin. ", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone. Today I am going to briefly cover our fourth quarter highlights and I\u2019d encourage everyone to read our earnings release where we provide considerably more detail. And my remarks will also focus on this year, how we think things look currently and where we are trying to take the company in the near-term from a financial perspective. ", "To help you, there are slides now available on our website. ", "So looking at the first slide, it shows our consolidated financial results for each of the fourth quarter and full year 2007. From my perspective, the important takeaway here is that Time Warner achieved its full year financial objectives that were laid out at the beginning of last year, and there are three important areas. First, adjusted OIBDA growth in the mid- to high-teens. That was the outlook and the company\u2019s 17% growth rate ended up solidly within the range. ", "Second, earnings per share of $1.07, which when adjusted for items affecting comparability, translated into an adjusted EPS expectation of approximately $0.95, and we beat that by a penny delivering adjusted EPS of $0.96. ", "And last, converting between 30% and 40% of its adjusted OIBDA into free cash flow, conversion actually came in at 38%, the higher end of the range, translating into $5 billion of free cash. ", "Supporting these results was an increase of approximately $2.8 billion in revenues and some very active cost management. Overall margins for the year expanded around 300 basis points over 2006. And another way to think about this is that nearly 68% of the growth in revenues dropped down directly as an increase in adjusted OIBDA. ", "Moving on, looking at the next slide which shows EPS, 2007 diluted EPS was $1.08 compared to $1.20 for 2006. Both years, however, had a number of items that affected comparability. These are highlighted on this slide and also in greater detail in our earnings release. ", "Adjusting for these, 2007 EPS increased $0.16 or 20% compared to the prior year, and the increase was driven by our adjusted OIBDA growth and the benefits of the company\u2019s share repurchase programs. ", "Turning to free cash flow on the next slide, as I mentioned Time Warner generated approximately $5 billion of free cash in 2007. That\u2019s comprised of $12.9 billion of adjusted OIBDA reduced by nearly $3 billion of cash interest and taxes, capital expenditures of $4.4 billion, and $700 million of working capital uses. ", "The $5 billion generated last year was a little more than $200 million higher than 2006, and that\u2019s because Time Warner delivered almost $2 billion more in adjusted OIBDA but there were a few items that offset that, mainly due to our cable company that was about $550 million of higher interest due to the Adelphia Comcast acquisitions and share repurchases. And lastly, we had $350 million of incremental capital expenditures also mainly due to the Adelphia and Comcast transactions. ", "So that\u2019s a quick look at the 2007 consolidated results and I\u2019ll move on now to talk to our near-term expectations. So looking at the next slide, we\u2019re laying out here our 2008 business outlook and admittedly, it\u2019s still very early in the year and how things progress this year in many respects will be impacted by lots of different things but we thought it was important to tell you how we see things currently.", "We expect full year adjusted OIBDA percentage growth to be in the range of between 7% and 9%. We also expect 2008 free cash flow to be at or above $3.6 billion. Another way to think about it is that\u2019s at least $1 per diluted share. And this is somewhat lower than last year\u2019s free cash flow because, as has been known for some time, the company expects to now be a full cash taxpayer going forward. And to put that in some perspective, the year-over-year increase in cash taxes is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.6 billion. ", "We hope that our free cash flow outlook proves conservative. At this point, however, forecast variability in areas such as interest, taxes, and working capital are holding us back somewhat from committing to higher levels. ", "Based on what we see today, we also anticipate earnings per diluted share in the range of between $1.07 and $1.11 and even at the low end, I point out that this represents solid double-digit year-over-year growth. ", "As you see on the next slide, we start 2008 with a balance sheet that\u2019s in good shape. We\u2019re beginning the year with $35.6 billion of net debt, which is up $2.2 billion from the prior year. The increase is due to $6.2 billion in share repurchases, nearly $900 million in dividend payments, and $912 million in payments related to settling securities litigation and government investigations. The company also spent $1.7 billion on acquisitions, including as Jeff said, almost $900 million at AOL.", "Reducing net debt during the year was $5 billion in free cash flow and $2.1 billion in net investment proceeds, which primarily included proceeds from the sales of non-core assets at each of AOL and Publishing. ", "Going forward, our financial strategy currently considers that we\u2019ll manage our balance sheet to maintain a consolidated three times leverage ratio and at year-end, we were below that I believe at around 2.8 times. And maintaining an investment grade rating, as Jeff said, clearly remains important to us. ", "Looking over at our equity capitalization for a moment on the next slide, the company continued to repurchase shares under its existing buy-back authorization. Since its initial share repurchase program was announced in August of 2005, Time Warner has reduced over 26% of its outstanding shares. That\u2019s more than 1.2 billion shares. Almost 2.8 of the company\u2019s most recent $5 billion authorization has not been spent and this more than fulfills the promise previously made to complete at least half of the program by today. ", "Now let\u2019s spend a few minutes talking about our divisional performance and our near-term expectations for each, and let\u2019s start with AOL. ", "As Jeff mentioned, clearly AOL remains in the midst of a very significant business model turnaround and to begin with, to share some personal perspective coming back to Time Warner, I\u2019ve been very impressed with how AOL has been managing through this financial transition as well, highlighting the fact that AOL was actually able to grow its adjusted OIBDA in 2007 to more than $1.8 billion despite losing over $1.5 billion of organic domestic subscription revenues. That\u2019s quite an achievement in any year. ", "Margins have improved by over 1,200 basis points here and that underscores AOL's aggressive management of costs. ", "Looking at the next slide, another key metric is usage. AOL achieved this goal of stabilizing page views late in 2007 and according to media metrics, they actually grew total domestic page views year over year and media metrics reported 49 billion page views in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s up 11% versus the last year and up 3% sequentially from the third quarter. ", "This reported growth includes the benefit of certain reporting adjustments made by media metrics, so based on our own internal estimates, we believe page views in the fourth quarter were closer to flat as compared to the same period last year. ", "And as Jeff mentioned, one of AOL's stated goals is to increase usage on its own O&O network and although AOL has stabilized page views despite the continued run-off of access subscribers, they are working very, very hard to grow page views. ", "Moving over to look at AOL's advertising results, at the next slide advertising revenues grew 10% year over year in the fourth quarter to $620 million and let me provide a little detail as to the components of growth here. ", "Starting first with its owned and operated network, display advertising was $252 million and that was up 3% year over year. But it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s really happening here in the reported growth figures. As impression gains were otherwise offset by both trends in the industry as well as strategic decisions made by management. ", "So what do I mean by that? First, advertising demand is continuing to shift to third-party networks. This is an industry trend. It\u2019s been ongoing and you can see this in the healthy growth rates in AOL's third-party network. This has put some near-term pressure on CPMs, however, on the AOL O&O network and as a result, AOL has responded by adjusting its sales process and integrating more of its inventory with advertising.com and TACODA, both of which are important components of Platform-A. ", "Second, growth in display was negatively impacted by a decision made earlier this year to discontinue a number of non-profitable sponsorship initiatives, as well as the natural decline of certain bounty advertising from broadband providers. ", "To put this in perspective, the fourth quarter of 2006 included $25 million of advertising revenue that did not recur this year. ", "Looking at paid search for a moment, paid search was $171 million in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s up only 1% compared to the prior year, but there are a few things of note here too. First, paid search in Europe, which represents approximately 20% of AOL's overall paid search business, declined year over year by $8 million. This is primarily due to a change in our European search agreement with Google, which no longer provides AOL with guaranteed payments. ", "Second, in the U.S. paid search was up mid-single-digits year over year. AOL benefited from the positive ongoing industry-wide search pricing trends, but this was somewhat offset by lower number of users searching and lower average click-through rates. ", "Moving to AOL's third-party network, advertising revenue was nearly $200 million in the quarter, up almost 30% versus the year-ago quarter. ", "I think as you know, AOL has been acquiring and building important analytical and measurement capabilities in Platform-A and it\u2019s important to note that nearly half of the quarter growth came from acquisitions that were made during 2007. That\u2019s half the growth of the third-party network. ", "Having said that, we remain very, very encouraged by the organic growth trends that we are seeing here in this part of the business. ", "Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008, we\u2019re expecting overall AOL reported advertising revenues to be essentially flat to down maybe slightly as compared to the year-ago quarter and let me tell you why. ", "First, as we disclosed to you last year, the first quarter of 2007 benefited from $19 million from a change in accounting estimates. Next, we have approximately $10 million less in revenues from these discontinued or diminished activities, similar to the $25 million that I just talked about in the fourth quarter of 2006. ", "Lastly, we have a difficult comparison created by the recent change in the Apollo relationship, which contributed $56 million to the first quarter of last year. And as a reminder, Apollo is the large advertiser that we previously pointed to in our public filings and we have reason to believe will spend less money with us this year. ", "Moving past revenues to AOL's profit for a moment, adjusted OIBDA in the fourth quarter grew a very healthy 29% year over year, despite a 53% in subscription revenues. ", "During the quarter, AOL reduced its costs by an impressive $344 million compared to the year-ago quarter, including having $81 million of lower restructuring costs. ", "In 2007, AOL reduced its operating expenses by $1.3 billion. ", "This year, continuing to successfully execute the business turnaround will remain front and center. As Jeff said, AOL's top priority will be to focus on growing usage while integrating its world-class display advertising network, providing reach with industry-leading analytics targeting an ROI. ", "Subscription revenues will continue to decline materially, although we believe less than what occurred in 2007. Costs will also continue to be reduce and advertising should continue to grow. ", "The results of all of this is that we continue to expect AOL to maintain its overall profitability at considerable scale, although they are likely to deliver a somewhat lower level of adjusted OIBDA in 2008 as compared to what they did in 2007. Included in this expectation that AOL's adjusted OIBDA is likely to be down in the first quarter because of the relative size of subscription business. ", "Turning now to Time Warner Cable and I\u2019m not really going to spend much time here, since Time Warner Cable separately reported its fourth quarter and full year results earlier this morning. In case you didn\u2019t have an opportunity to listen in to their call, I\u2019d encourage you to listen to the replay that\u2019s available through their website. ", "Let me tell you from my perspective, however, the key takeaways in their report and business outlook are as follows: first, the company met all of its 2007 announced financial objectives -- strong, 13% OIBDA growth compared to pro forma fourth quarter 2006, with really meaningful margin expansion. This allowed Time Warner Cable to achieve a very solid 11% full year growth rate compared to pro forma 2006. ", "The company continues to generate strong RGU net additions, delivering nearly 600,000 more RGUs with notable progress in its most challenged divisions, Los Angeles and Dallas. ", "Their outlook in 2008 remains attractive in terms of the expectations of near-term financial growth and at the same time, it considers relatively flat capital expenditure expectations despite aggressive plans to invest in new business initiatives, which should yield future growth such as commercial phone. ", "So we are expecting improving returns on capital at Cable and that\u2019s very important. ", "Moving on, the next slide summarizes Cable subscriber results but I\u2019m not going to spend any time here. I\u2019d ask you to keep moving on to the filmed entertainment segment slide. ", "On this slide, we show that we posted very strong year-over-year OIBDA growth rates in the fourth quarter against some fairly easy year-ago comparisons, but I would note that there were increasing contributions year over year from each of the film and the TV businesses. ", "Looking into this year, we expect positive year-over-year growth from this segment again, despite very difficult comparisons created by last year\u2019s off-network syndication results from Warner Brothers TV. This view is based on our confidence in both the theatrical and the home video release slates, and so far, we\u2019re off to a really good start with box office success of Warner Brothers \u201cI Am Legend\u201d and \u201cThe Bucket List\u201d, which should lead to strong home video releases later this year. ", "We also have some other significant 2008 releases, including Warner Brothers Get Smart, The Dark Knight, and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, as well as New Line\u2019s Sex and the City. ", "Looking over at our network segment for a minute on the next slide, the results in the fourth quarter compared to last year were essentially flat. Please remember that last year included HBO\u2019s domestic cable sale of The Sopranos to A&E, which you can see on the slide was the main driver behind the 46% decline in content revenues. There was also a $31 million accrual reversal in the prior year quarter related to the closing of the WB Networks operations. ", "The quarter\u2019s results also included a very strong 9% increase in subscription revenues and an even stronger 14% increase in advertising revenue at Turner. The strong ad growth reflected a healthy scatter environment and overall solid ratings and so far this year, the scatter market has remained strong. ", "Our expectation for the year is that both HBO and Turner will contribute to growth. In fact, taken together they should deliver strong adjusted OIBDA growth in 2008. And the drivers here are expected to be solid overall subscription revenue growth again and a continuing healthy ad environment. ", "Looking at Q1 specifically for a moment, we expect networks\u2019 OIBDA to be essentially flat due to the timing of recognition of some programming expenses and additional news gathering costs at CNN related to its election coverage. ", "Moving over to our last division, publishing, both revenues and adjusted OIBDA for the fourth quarter were up modestly. Advertising was up 2% as Time Inc. continued to generate enough online revenue to more than offset declines in print magazine advertising. The results here also reflected the closure of Life and Business 2.0 magazines and an increase, or rather an incremental $13 million of restructuring costs. ", "Unlike Turner and AOL, Time Inc. is the one business where we\u2019ve seen some current advertising softness due to what we believe is the overall economic environment. And this does somewhat limit our visibility into the rest of the year. Having said that, regardless of the print advertising environment, we expect Time Inc. is going to continue to focus on its priorities of key titles, continue to drive its digital initiatives and aggressively manage its costs. ", "So with that, let me now turn the call back over to Jim and we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks, John. Operator, you can go to the first question. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.", "Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you very much. Just curious, Jeff, on some of the strategic initiatives you mentioned. Any thoughts on the AOL side as you split the two businesses, what the strategic rationale would be behind keeping the AOL audience business? And any impact of the marketplace that you see from the Microsoft/Yahoo! deal potentially getting done? Thanks. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks. We don\u2019t really see a change in the strategy at AOL in the audience business. We, as we said, we\u2019re really excited by both the growth and the resilience of our AOL network of owned and operated and portal and publishing sites. A lot of them have had some very strong page view growth in the last half of this year and the position that we\u2019ve built and are continuing to build on the monetization side is at scale and leading at this point. ", "As video comes to be more important, we believe that that is going to advantage our position in that platform too. So of course we are, as we always are, open to any strategic moves that make sense. What we are really doing is we are trying to position the different pieces of AOL, particularly in the high growth parts of the Internet business, so that we are poised to succeed. ", "So we feel pretty good about our position, including in this recent set of events with Microsoft trying to buy Yahoo!. ", "One thing we should point out -- it does underscore the value of Internet properties with large audience. It does have a beneficial lift really to the value of our eyeballs and inventory, because they are going to be more vibrant competitors for search. And as we\u2019ve said, I think it just verifies the importance of moving to the kind of display and third-party monetization platform that we\u2019ve built. ", "Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks, Doug. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from  Spencer Wang with Bear Stearns.", "Spencer Wang - Bear Stearns", "Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to focus a little bit more on AOL. Jeff, you alluded to trying to separate the access and the advertising business. Can you just give us a sense of the time table for when you would do that? And also maybe talk a little bit about some of the -- I think you mentioned options, increase in the options there. Talk a little bit more about some of the alternatives you may be looking at. ", "And then the last thing is, when do you expect AOL advertising growth to start to reaccelerate to further its more comparable to the overall industry? Thank you. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I\u2019ll start and give it to John. We are starting and actually actively working on separating the audience and access businesses now. We think it will take several more months because it\u2019s fairly complicated. Having said that, it\u2019s one of our top priorities. ", "And as for strategic options, it\u2019s simply always a good idea to align your businesses including what investment resources you put into them to match up where your efforts are with where the growth possibilities are, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re doing. ", "In doing that, it provides the most advantaged position for any of our operations should they need to make some kind of arrangement with other companies. ", "And on the growth of advertising, John. ", "John K. Martin", "", "So we would expect that at AOL, ad growth is going to begin to improve beginning in the second quarter of this year. I thought it was important to sort of walk through some of the mechanics that are going to impact the reported growth rates in Q1 and hopefully I\u2019ve done that with enough transparency. Just to provide some context and perspective, however, AOL is really focusing on building its leading display monetization platform and this is important because it has scale, it\u2019s got the behavioral and context targeting capabilities and this is where we believe demand is going. And we see this as the future of where display demand is going and Platform-A over time once it\u2019s integrated should benefit not only third parties but our own inventory, which is really important as you think about pricing going forward. ", "So first and foremost, focus on the integration but you should begin to see growth again in Q2 and we\u2019ll build from there. ", "Spencer Wang - Bear Stearns", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Morris with UBS.", "Michael Morris - UBS", "Thank you. On the content side, it seems that the development of franchises and the ability to exploit content across multiple platforms and markets has benefited some of your competitors. Can you talk a bit about how you view the importance of developing franchises, if it\u2019s going to take additional investment from where you are right now, and maybe if you see certain things in the pipeline that perhaps aren\u2019t obvious I\u2019d say beyond Harry Potter, which is more obvious, but maybe some of the content that is less obvious but it does present a franchise opportunity for you. Thanks. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I don\u2019t know whether -- I\u2019ll try. Actually, there\u2019s two ways to think of what you are asking, I think. One is to think of titles like Harry Potter or Batman or to think of individual television shows like Two and a Half Men, or The Closer on TNT. Or some of the hits on Adult Swim at Turner. ", "All of those kinds of franchises, you know, branded individual shows, clearly are -- probably overstating it to say they are exploding but there is a huge opportunity in those on a global basis across all of these new distribution platforms. That\u2019s true when you are thinking title by title on day-and-date VOD, which Warners is leading the test on. We think it\u2019s working. It\u2019s true on any of these worldwide video releases that go electronically rather than in physical duplication copies. ", "So that\u2019s one way to say it. And across all of our companies, and you can really drag in publishing for this, we\u2019ve got some individual brand franchises. Think of Harry Potter and then put the Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated and think of it the same way. They go across all of these media and have increasing upside, so hits are evermore important in this world. ", "But then the second way I think about your question are brands that are literal networks or aggregators, so that would be true of HBO. That would be true of Adult Swim, of CNN, and it would be true increasingly of some of the verticals at AOL. We\u2019ve got, even in the -- you know, what you think of as the publishing sites at AOL, AOL News relaunched in the middle of the year and is now number two in that area. AOL Money and Finance has gotten to number one. Page views are increasing 16% in the one, 24% year over year in the other. So all of these things are ways in which you can extend brands across the world and across all these platforms. ", "Michael Morris - UBS", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Michael Nathanson, Sanford Bernstein.", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein", "I have one for John and one for Jeff. Jeff, firstly, given that usage trends at AOL have now stabilized, what gives you confidence that the trends will accelerate going forward? And is increasing usage the key to growing display revenue closer to industry revenue in the coming year? That\u2019s one. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "All right. Well, first, I guess I was just talking about it coincidentally, we have some reinvigorated publishing sites. That\u2019s one part of AOL. We\u2019ve got very strong positions in communications -- think about AIM and ICQ, and those are benefiting as they get distributed out with the advent of social networking, because they are very connected to the explosion globally on that. ", "And then, it\u2019s always good and fairly important to have our own owned and operated inventory of impressions coming out of page views, as you just said, but it\u2019s also important that we can monetize other people\u2019s growing page views that they can\u2019t monetize themselves. ", "And so we have been -- we like to think of it as a very strong business partner for the social networks like MySpace and Facebook and Bebo and any of the others, monetizing traffic. And we think that that\u2019s -- both of those ways are the ways where we will emphasize and try to ride the secular growth in the online ad industry. ", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay, and let me turn to John -- John, now that you are there, I wonder, can you tell me;  over the past couple of years, how has return on capital looked within filmed entertainment? And the changes at New Line also are going to be focused on improving returns within New Line?", "John K. Martin", "The only thing I would add to what Jeff just said is just keep in mind that given that Platform-A was really only put together over the last 12 months, we\u2019re only now beginning to apply behavioral and soon contextual technology to the inventory, so that should help over time improve the monetization as well. And it\u2019s very, very early and in very small numbers, but we\u2019ve seen some exciting and dramatic ramps in CPMs in certain areas. So again, that\u2019s just one other thing to consider as you think about over time what\u2019s going to grow revenues is both usage and monetization. ", "As it relates to returns on capital and the film business, frankly it\u2019s one of the things that we are going to be focusing on going forward. In full disclosure, being here for four weeks, I haven\u2019t been able to look at every single thing within the company\u2019s portfolio.", "Having said that, I would just ask people to think about what Warner Brothers has done over the last several years -- converting virtually 100% if not more than 100% of its earnings into free cash. And so this is a business that is at huge scale, is in leadership positions across all of its primary businesses, is very, very successful, and turns its profit into cash. So that\u2019s a good place to start from. ", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. Good morning. John, just a point of clarification on the AOL piece -- I think you said OIBDA would be down year over year. Was that for the first quarter or for the full year 2008?", "And along those lines to the comment you just made about usage and monetization driving the top line, where are AOL display CPMs relative to the broader market? Are you above average and is that part of the reason why we\u2019ve seen some CPM or monetization pressure over the last couple of quarters? I realize Platform-A is putting pressure on it because you are putting more revenue through the ad.com business, but just curious about the relative pricing between AOL display inventory and some of the competitors. ", "John K. Martin", "I think the first question should be relatively easy. The second one I\u2019ll try to keep at a relatively high level but it\u2019s a little bit more involved. The first one in terms of expectations for near-term financial performance for AOL, in Q1 I just wanted to highlight that we expect adjusted OIBDA to be down. That\u2019s really just the math of the run-off of the subscription business, as well as I went through the mechanics of what\u2019s going to happen to the reported ad growth, so that\u2019s number one. ", "In terms of the full year, and I would submit that AOL is probably the single hardest division for us to forecast where the adjusted OIBDA is going to be for the full year of 2008, simply because you\u2019ve got really big numbers moving in different directions and we\u2019ve got to accurately forecast the run-off of the subscription business. ", "Best we can tell right now, Ben, we think that full year 2008, AOL's adjusted OIBDA is going to be approaching what it was in 2007. I mean, it may achieve those levels but it is likely going to be down somewhat. ", "In terms of display CPMs, maybe just taking it at the top and speaking a little bit more broadly, what\u2019s happening here is basically in premium, we\u2019ve seen CPM pricing go back up. So the pricing really depends on the type of inventory and the trends have existed for some time. But the fact that premium pricing is starting to go back up we view obviously as a positive sign. ", "However, we\u2019re continuing to see pricing pressure on non-premium inventory as demand is shifting over to the ad networks and that\u2019s in part following audiences in recognition that audiences are fragmenting across the web. ", "The good news here, just to go back to what I said before, is that the eventual inclusion of meaningful amounts of behavioral and contextual targeting should help reverse the non-premium inventory pricing trend. It\u2019s just hard to predict exactly when that\u2019s going to occur but that\u2019s what we believe is going to happen. ", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for the color. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citigroup.", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Thanks so much. If I remember correctly, I still think Google has a put provision for the 5% stake they have in AOL and I guess my question is, as you think about potentially separating these businesses, does that pose any complications? And if not, is it just a function of allocating that pro rata potential need of cash based on the value of each of the pieces? Thanks. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I\u2019ll start and John, you may want to comment. Yes, Google does have that and it\u2019s not clear at all that they would necessarily want to act on it. And it would be -- it\u2019s fine if they were to act on it. So we probably shouldn\u2019t predict or discuss any ongoing talks, but Google is a fairly close business partner of ours. We talk to them all the time. We just can\u2019t say much about it at this point, but I certainly don\u2019t think you should look at it as any cause for concern for any reason. ", "John K. Martin", "Yeah, it\u2019s not going to affect how we approach the access/audience split. We are going to go ahead and do that. Google, just a quick point of clarification, has basically a registration right and that is in the middle of the year and we have the option to buy out their stake at fair market value. ", "And at this point in time, we\u2019re not going to guess as to how that is going to come out. ", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from  Rich Greenfield of Pali Capital.", "Rich Greenfield - Pali Capital", "A couple of questions; one, you talked about splitting off cable or separating out cable. I\u2019m wondering, with Time Warner Cable having dropped its price from a year ago, 42 down to 24, why you don\u2019t think about trying to buy it in, given your positive view and especially John\u2019s experience over at Time Warner Cable? Why not buy it in and take advantage of the weakness in valuation and separate it out at some point the road when valuations recover in the cable industry?", "And then two, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about from the standpoint of New Line whether there is any contractual issues with Michael Lynne and Bob Shaye in terms of their ownership directly of New Line that dates back to when they first came into the Time Warner fold, that would be helpful. Thanks. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks. Fair question on Cable. A couple of things on that -- in terms of the timing of why we are talking to you about it now, it didn\u2019t make sense for us to initiate in-depth discussions until we were closer to the time which we now are when we had a fully array of options for changing our ownership, including options that are tax efficient. So that\u2019s just the backdrop. ", "A reasonable question as to why -- you know, what you\u2019re asking, why not buy it in instead of something else. We\u2019re starting the discussions with Time Warner Cable\u2019s board and we really don\u2019t think it\u2019s advisable to negotiate publicly on what the various choices we have are. We have said and I think there\u2019s a good premise in your question that all of us I think, our board and Time Warner Cable\u2019s board, believe that the Cable position in the cable industry is under-valued. ", "So certainly we\u2019ll approach whatever we do in that context but we are basically -- what we end up doing is dependent somewhat on the negotiations with the independent board. There\u2019s some considerations that have to be vetted. Some of the notable ones are determining the relative leverage of the cable company and resolving the TW&Y stake. So that\u2019s basically all we can say at this point about what we are going to do in cable. ", "On the New Line side, good question there, but it\u2019s very clear -- there are not any ownership positions in New Line. Time Warner owns New Line 100% and we have the same relationship with Bob and Mike that we do with all our other executives. ", "Rich Greenfield - Pali Capital", "And just to follow-up on Time Warner Cable, so just to be clear -- you\u2019re not against the concept of buying it in if that\u2019s what you end up determining is the best course of action?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We\u2019re doing whatever is the best value creator for both TWX and TWC. ", "Rich Greenfield - Pali Capital", "Thank you. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks, Rich. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente. ", "Anthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers", "-- look at the networks, do you see an opportunity for further growth for networks via consolidation? And if you could consolidate any of the scripts discovery or the NBCU cable networks, should any of those come up, would you be interested or what other restructuring moves, i.e. with Cable, preclude you from any of those types of deals? ", "And then second question, Jeff, you talked at the outset about taking content from linear ad-supported networks and aggressively offering that content on demand on television. So I would assume that you have a strong view that this model would not cannibalize the existing ad-supported businesses, particularly at Turner. ", "So I\u2019m wondering what gives you that high conviction that digital distribution is incremental to the network model and not cannibalistic? Thank you. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay, the first one on horizontal consolidation of various cable networks, we are not constrained in any way from doing any of the things you asked, number one. Second, it\u2019s always a -- and it\u2019s a good reason, I think, why you asked it -- it\u2019s always got some pluses when you take another, say in the cable business, cable network and have some horizontal synergies and some ability to take capabilities and spread them across networks. ", "So in general, it\u2019s a reasonable idea. In terms of us saying which of those specifics -- you mentioned scripts and discovery and NBC and all that -- all of them, as you know, are in various stages of questions being raised or they themselves have said they may do something. ", "We\u2019re a big media company that has this position in networks and we\u2019re going to look at everything, of course. But we never will or should comment on how we are going to evaluate these kinds of opportunities, so I\u2019m sorry, we can\u2019t say more about it at this point. ", "On the -- what was the other -- network VOD. I don\u2019t see it as -- I don\u2019t see it -- I see it as the reverse of cannibalizing. It supports viewership in these networks and it actually cements loyalty to the networks and our belief is that it\u2019s really the best way to preserve and increase the advertising and it further gives an opportunity, which you can talk to the cable companies -- ours, Comcast, et cetera -- about to use the targeting of the Internet to make the advertising spots that are going to be on cable TV screens on an on-demand basis even more valuable than they\u2019ve been in the past. ", "So we think it\u2019s a triple win, more than a double win. ", "Anthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks, Anthony. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is Jessica Reif Cohen of Merrill Lynch.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. I have a couple of questions. On the spin-off of Cable, which is arguably your fastest growing business, it seems to be driven largely by balance sheet differences. So could you comment on what your comfort level is for leverage for the content businesses once they are separated?", "Also, you didn\u2019t really comment on long-term interest in retaining publishing. And then, on the CW write-down, the $73 million write-down, why -- I guess the question is why take the loss now and what do you expect from this asset over the long-term?", "John K. Martin", "Let me start on the first part, which is the comment on the leverage of what I would say the non-cable company and unfortunately now, I guess we don\u2019t really feel like we are in a position where we should and can comment on that because of what Jeff said before, that we are essentially going to be entering into a discussion which is really a negotiation. So there will be more and we\u2019ll be more transparent and forthcoming as we possibly can. ", "The second, as it relates to the impairment charge I think you were referring to, this was just basically the accounting rules say that you need to once a year essentially look at all of your assets and determine whether any of them are impaired, comparing their net book value to the fair value. And this was based on a fair value determination, it was -- there was a decision made that we thought that there was an impairment, which essentially required that we had to take the charge. It\u2019s a non-cash charge. It\u2019s a book charge only but it\u2019s something -- it\u2019s an evaluation that we do literally every -- you know, all the assets across Time Warner. ", "You had a second question in there which I actually don\u2019t think -- at least, Jeff, I don\u2019t know if you heard. I didn\u2019t hear -- I think it was what is our long-term interest in publishing. Would you mind repeating that?", "Jessica Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, that\u2019s exactly it -- what is your long-term interest in publishing?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We\u2019re good at publishing. We\u2019re the leader in the industry. It\u2019s a good business we think and as it converts, as it expands out beyond print into digital, which a number of our leading franchises are doing, we think it can turn into a fairly strong growth business in the middle term. And it is growing now and we think it\u2019s got real promise. ", "So it does depend on our being able to demonstrate that to ourselves and to our investors. ", "Jessica Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks, Jessica. Operator, could we take one more question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question comes from  Imran Khan of J.P. Morgan.", "Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions -- in terms of the film, what kind of cost saving opportunities do you see in the film division? Is it from overhead or a different approach to film production or distribution? And what kind of profitability are you aiming for and how quickly we can get there?", "And then the last question on AOL, I think the search is a very scalable business, so as the market consolidates, how do you think you can grow your search business? How can you maintain your search market share? Thank you. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I\u2019ll start on film. We mentioned some structural things that we are looking hard at in terms of getting efficiency between New Line and Warners. That would be one. ", "Second, we -- John mentioned that at Warners, we have a very high cash conversion to earnings and a very high absolute earnings level. So we are doing a certain amount of I think what is asked in the question, and what we\u2019ll continue to do, we think digital gives an opportunity to do this, is that as we move forward and keep redesigning our production processes, our marketing, and take use of digital distribution -- just to stop on an example. We have a day-and-date test which we are putting some of our titles on on-demand at the same time they are in physical rental. We don\u2019t see any drop in sell-through and the rental shift from physical over to digital moves us to a 70% margin instead of a 30% margin, so that would be one example. ", "Another example would be on a global basis, coordinating more both in time and in universality, I guess, coining a word, of what the marketing campaigns are. We can both streamline the cost and we think increase the consumer impact of our global marketing activity. ", "So they are just ongoing things in the evolution of that business and we are and always have been at the very lead of global scale and we think that gives us an advantage in any of those kind of improvements and in our distribution power around the world. ", "John K. Martin", "On your second question, Imran, on search, just a quick reminder -- AOL is really not a principal in search and so when you think about it has an existing relationship with Google and so as you think about how to grow those revenues, it basically comes back to what Jeff was saying at the beginning and it comes back to the strategy -- grow usage, increase the number of searches, drive overall engagement, and then drive monetization, which in part is going to be driven by overall industry trends but in part by what AOL can do and they are working very, very hard to do that. I think some of the examples that Jeff gave in terms of their redesigns and new launches of product and the early success that they are having gives us confidence and optimism that they are actually going to be able to grow and continue to drive search revenue. ", "As I mentioned, they have an existing Google deal. I\u2019ll just go back to the extent that the search providers in the industry consolidate -- that could also prove beneficial for us, as it could flash the value, so to speak, with respect to our scaled audience. So that\u2019s how I would say it. ", "Jim Burtson", "Thanks, Imran and Operator -- thanks to everyone on the call. ", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference.

(Operator Instructions) Now I will turn the call over to Doug Shapiro, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir, you may begin. ", "Doug Shapiro", "Thank you and thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's 2008 second quarter earnings conference call. This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the second quarter of 2008 and the other reaffirming our 2008 business outlook. ", "Before we begin, there are a few items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release or trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. A reconciliation of our expected future financial performance is also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website. ", "Second, today\u2019s announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation to and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. ", "Finally, I would like to draw your attention to Time Warner's new quarterly investor newsletter, In Focus, which features news and operational highlights from our businesses and we think you will find it helpful. It\u2019s now available in the investor relations section of the company\u2019s website. ", "With that covered, I will thank you and turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. With half the year behind us, today is a good time to take you through what we\u2019ve achieved so far and what we are working toward in the months ahead. ", "If you boil it down, or goal at Time Warner is to create, package, and distribute high quality branded content across multiple platforms and all around the world, and doing all that at the highest returns possible. ", "When you hear that word platforms, you tend to think of it as kind of organized speech. For us, it\u2019s basically TV screens, computer screens, movie screens, magazine pages, anywhere that media content goes in the world and whichever one is most important in the country where you live. ", "Well, at the beginning of this year, we laid out three key objectives to help us reach this goal. First, to make sure we have the right businesses and the right structure; second, to improve the competitive position and the operating performance of all of our businesses; and third, to actively manage the balance sheet. ", "So as we\u2019ve been doing, I would like to start with the first of these priorities, our structure. I think we\u2019ve made substantial progress since we last met on the call. In May, we announced the terms of our separation from Time Warner Cable. This is the right step for both Time Warner and Time Warner Cable stockholders because it will increase the long-term strategic, operational, and financial flexibility of each company. It also marks an important step in the continuing transformation of Time Warner. Since May, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress toward the cable separation and we still expect the deal to close around year-end.", "Still in the structure area, turning next to AOL, we\u2019ve now made the key financial and strategic decisions that will enable us to operate the access and audience businesses separately. First, we classified all of AOL\u2019s assets and liabilities into one of three groups -- access, audience, and a share service group that will support both of the operating groups. Second, we are finalizing operating agreements among these groups so that they can operate fairly flexibly. And we are pretty clear that implementing these decisions in the coming months should enable us to begin running these businesses separately in 2009. ", "So with the progress we\u2019ve made on that to date, we have the necessary flexibility to do something strategic with either of these businesses today. ", "In the film area, still in the question of structure, we also essentially completed the reorganization of New Line Cinema. We still think that the cost savings and revenue improvements will produce benefits in excess of $140 million annually starting next year. And then last, our effort to streamline our corporate costs is running ahead of our target of $50 million in annualized reductions this year. ", "So that was all the structural moves that you know that we\u2019ve had underway. Let\u2019s move to our second key objective, improving our operating performance. ", "Overall, we\u2019re delivering results in line with our plan and in line with our guidance, as you saw this morning, despite the tough economic climate. Some of our businesses are tracking ahead of expectation, some are essentially on target, and some are behind. Let me start with the businesses that are performing ahead of expectations this year, networks and film. ", "At Turner, we posted another quarter of very strong financial results with 11% advertising growth and double-digit subscription revenue increases. Ratings remain strong at our largest networks, beginning with CNN. Delivering was up better than 20% in the key primetime demos compared to last year. The election season is helping, of course, but we are also taking share. Consider that CNN is also up almost 20% from the second quarter of 2004, and that was the comparable period in the last presidential election. Each of the broadcast networks\u2019 news divisions and our key cable news competitor are down double-digits over the same period, so that\u2019s essentially the news sector inside Turner. ", "In Turner\u2019s entertainment networks, also posting very strong growth, TBS up 33% and TNT up 8% in the key primetime demos. And TNT\u2019s original programming strategy, which we have been talking about on these calls, continues to gain momentum. Last month, the premiere broadcast of the The Closer and Saving Grace captured the number one and number two highest rating cable debuts for this year. ", "And we\u2019ve longed maintained that our entertainment networks are broadcast substitutes, and this position has increasingly resonated with advertisers as we\u2019ve continued to enhance our brands, our programming, and our reach but never more so than during this year\u2019s up-front. ", "On average, our entertainment networks posted CPM increases in the high-single-digits and dollar volume increases well into the double-digits. These increases mark the top-end of the entire TV universe. That includes both broadcast and cable. ", "Subscriber supported television -- after a pause last year, HBO is on track to again growth its OIBDA by double-digits this year, and that\u2019s driven by solid affiliate fee growth and a very predictable, well-managed expense base. ", "Underscoring its continued success in attracting top talent, HBO received the most Emmy nominations of any network for the eighth year in a row -- 85 nominations, 23 for John Adams alone, and if you saw John Adams, he was alone a fair amount of the time. ", "In recent months, HBO has accelerated its production of pilots for original series and it now has more in development than at any time in its history, with the goal of having new seasons of original shows on every quarter. ", "Now, let\u2019s go to Warner Brothers. Warners has had an extremely successful run this year. Unless you are living in the batcave itself, by now you know that the -- you are aware of the record-breaking summer of The Dark Knight, which is now on track to become the second-highest grossing film of all time and who knows -- we might make it to the top. ", "Some view the film business as unpredictable. That\u2019s not really been our experience at our company because viewed through the prism of a multi-year timeframe, The Dark Knight is no fluke. Our studios have now produced eight of the top 15 grossing films of all time and no other studio counts for more than two. This success reflects our scale and our strategy, the machine we\u2019ve built up around tent-poles, from development to production, marketing and distribution particularly, manufactures hits, turns them into hits, and over a multi-year period has done so consistently. ", "It\u2019s the film business, so occasionally we misfire, as we did with the Speed Racer, but our hits far outweigh our misses and you can see it in the consistency of our financial results in film. ", "It also reflects our ability to mine our intellectual property. You are familiar with three of our most successful franchises -- Batman, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings. These three are already among the top six highest grossing franchises ever at the box office worldwide and there are more films yet to come from each of these franchises. And please keep in mind that we have yet to exploit much of our DC Comics portfolio or our vast TV library. ", "For example, our most successful theatrical release in this second quarter -- remember, Dark Knight is third quarter -- in the second quarter was Sex and the City and Get Smart, both originating as TV shows and the success of Sex and the City, just to pick one, was particularly gratifying because it\u2019s a property that touched so many parts of our company. It has its inception on HBO, it was syndicated with great success on TBS, then became a film produced by New Line and finally was marketed and distributed worldwide by Time Warner Brothers, so that would be one. ", "Another example that we are very excited about coming up, Star Wars: Clone Wars. This will be the first CGI Star Wars theatrical release. It will be released by Warners next month in theaters and after that, we\u2019ll debut The Clone Wars TV series on Cartoon Network and then it will have rebroadcast on TNT.", "Now, Warner Brothers also continues to lead the industry in the most promising growth areas in the film business. Two of these are Blu-Ray and VOD. As you know, since our decision to embrace the Blu-Ray format exclusively, industry sales have accelerated significantly. We\u2019ve been the most aggressive studio also on the VOD front. For example, next year every release, with the exception of Harry Potter coming out of Warners, will be released to VOD day-and-date, and in both Blu-Ray and VOD, we have the highest sales of any studio, substantially over-indexing relative to our theatrical share. ", "Now, still in the films segment is the games business, and our games business is also ramping up. Lego Indiana Jones was the top-selling videogame in June and we have high hopes for Lego Batman, as you can imagine, which we are releasing in September. Over time, we expect games to become an increasingly important part of Warner Brothers' business. ", "So moving from -- now I think I\u2019d like to move over to the business that\u2019s performing essentially in line with our financial expectations but it\u2019s actually ahead on subscriber growth, and that\u2019s Time Warner Cable. ", "As you heard on its earnings call earlier this morning, Time Warner Cable posted another quarter of very strong RGU net additions. It was the best second quarter in its history, and that\u2019s in pretty stark contrast to concerns about the impact of competition, whether from phone or satellite, and the economy. So the company remains on pace to achieve the key elements of its full-year financial outlook.  ", "Turning last to AOL and publishing, these are both tracking behind our expectations this year but for different reasons. At AOL, there continues to be encouraging signs about the underlying health of the business; in particular, it continues to post strong usage growth, which is accelerating from last quarter. Total page views, for example, during the quarter on the AOL network were up 6% over last year, powered by almost 60% growth in our content verticals, which shows the success of all our recent relaunches there. ", "In addition, as John will outline, our third-party advertising business continued to deliver solid growth even in a difficult ad environment, which highlights the competitive position and the value of platform A. But as anticipated, display advertising declined in the quarter. It was down 14%. We saw pull-backs on some ad categories, notably autos, financial services, telecom and travel. But we believe this performance was also due to the continuing effects of the acquisition integration issues that we discussed on our last earnings call, because as you\u2019ll remember we put a lot of pieces together over the last year. And as we cautioned then, we did not expect to reverse those trends in the second quarter. ", "The good news, or the better news, is that we have made substantial progress since then, particularly this month, during the recent period. Platform A is now fully integrated -- that\u2019s across sales, marketing, operations, and engineering, and we fully integrated Tacoda and Quigo targeting technologies, which we can now offer access to across the AOL network inventory and across, of course, the third-party network. ", "We remain optimistic, as we said last time, that we are going to see the benefits of these organizational changes starting in the second half. ", "And then moving last to publishing, which as I said is behind our targets, of all our advertising driven businesses, Time Inc. felt the greatest impact from the difficult advertising environment. There was softness in the quarter across many of the same categories, including pharmaceuticals, autos, cosmetics, and financial services, and that drove down advertising revenues by 9% year over year in the quarter. Online ad revenue continued to grow rapidly but this quarter, it was not sufficient to offset the decline in print. ", "There are a number of bright spots in our publishing business. Time Inc. continues to drive traffic to its websites. Unique visitors are up more than 30% year over year in the quarter across all of its sites, according to Nielsen, and magazine readership growth also remains strong. We have about double the growth pacing of the rest of the industry in the second quarter, and our publishing company continues to manage its cost structure aggressively. ", "So we don\u2019t know when the ad market will turn but we are confident that Time Inc. will be well-positioned when it does. ", "I\u2019ll close by touching on our third primary objective, which is actively managing our balance sheet. We define that as maintaining a level of leverage that supports a solid investment grade rating for our businesses, while balancing opportunities to invest against returning capital to stockholders. ", "Our first priority in using our financial capacity will always be to continue investing in the growth of our businesses, but this is unlikely to use much, and certainly not all of our excess capacity. ", "We will also pursue acquisitions, those that improve our competitive position and our growth prospects in our existing operations but only in a disciplined way. And that means the expected return on investment must be better than alternative uses of our capital, including repurchasing our own stock. And of course, with the current price of our stock and earnings multiples attached to that, that is a high hurdle to meet in acquisition assessment. ", "And we do believe strongly in the merits of returning capital directly to stockholders. You may notice in our press release that we didn\u2019t buy back any stock in the quarter. We do consider the stock extremely attractive at current levels but in light of all that we have had going on, we decided it was prudent to stay out of the market. ", "As you know, a key element of the cable separation is that when it closes around the end of the year, Time Warner Cable will pay a special dividend to all of its shareholders, including $9 billion in a quarter to Time Warner. That step will better optimize the balance sheets of both Time Warner and Time Warner Cable. And post-close, it will provide Time Warner with a lot of flexibility. We regard that as an important advantage but we recognize that it also has raised questions about how we intend to use this capacity. ", "We just want you to know that as we assess our capital allocation options, we will continue to adhere to the disciplined framework that I just outlined. ", "In sum, I am proud of how well we performed so far this year. We\u2019ve made significant progress on our key objectives and on the whole, our businesses have proven resilient in a tough economic environment, as evidenced by our ability to reaffirm our full-year business outlook. ", "The resilience stems from the strength of our brands, from the expertise of our people, and the scale of our operations, which we believe give us a sustained advantage in creating, packaging, and distributing the most compelling content worldwide. It\u2019s something Time Warner has always done extremely well and it\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about both our continued transformation toward an even more content focused company and about our long-term growth prospects. Certainly a lot more to do but we believe that we are taking the steps to deliver the most value to shareholders. ", "Thanks for listening and now I\u2019ll turn over the call to John Martin. ", "John K. Martin Jr.", "Thanks, Jeff and good morning. I am going to briefly provide some additional context around the second quarter results and as usual, there are slides now available on our website to help you follow along with my remarks. ", "Jumping right in, the first slide shows our consolidated second quarter financial highlights. There were a few takeaways to what we believed was a pretty good quarter overall. First, revenues were up 5% year over year, or $575 million, and adjusted OIBDA grew 4% or $115 million. ", "As you know, we\u2019ve been increasingly thinking about our businesses in three buckets, and they are cable, content, and AOL. In the second quarter, it\u2019s interesting to note that Time Warner's results will exclude the impact of both Cable and AOL, so effectively just the content businesses, which we are defining as networks, filmed entertainment, and publishing plus corporate expenses and eliminations. Those revenues grew high-single-digits in the quarter and adjusted OIBDA was up 11%. ", "The second takeaway is that our adjusted earnings per diluted share increased a solid 9% compared to the year-ago quarter, and third, we have now generated $2.9 billion of free cash flow year-to-date, which is a terrific start to the year and it represents a very high OIBDA conversion rate of 46%. ", "The next slide shows a little bit more detail related to our EPS figures. Diluted EPS was $0.22, which compares to $0.25 for the second quarter of 2007. Both quarters, however, had notable items affecting comparability. These are highlighted in broad groupings on this slide and in greater detail in our earnings release. Adjusting for these, the quarter\u2019s EPS was $0.24 and the 9% growth rate was due to both higher adjusted OIBDA and a smaller outstanding share count due to our buyback program. ", "Turning to free cash flow on the next slide, as I mentioned, year-to-date free cash of $2.9 billion is up considerably over the first half of last year, almost $900 million in fact. Much of this difference is due to a positive swing in working capital so far this year but we do expect at least a portion of this to reverse in the back half of the year. ", "Our cash interest expense is relatively flat and CapEx is also flat, or approximately flat over last year, with 83% of our capital at the cable segment year-to-date. It\u2019s interesting to see that when you exclude Time Warner Cable, the company\u2019s CapEx represents only about 2% to 3% of our revenues, which is very, very low. ", "I will also add that Time Warner has been delivering significant free cash flow on a very consistent basis. In fact, for nine of the last 10 quarters, our free cash flow has been close to or above $1 billion, and I believe in eight of the last 10 quarters, our conversion of OIBDA has been in excess of 30%. ", "Turning to the next slide, we are reaffirming our full-year business outlook and echoing what Jeff just said, we are encouraged that our business performance has proven resilient overall, and I think it\u2019s fair to say that the economic environment is clearly more challenging than we anticipated when we first provided our outlook at the beginning of the year and that\u2019s particularly true for the ad environment. ", "In this outlook, we focus on three measures. First, we reaffirm that adjusted OIBDA growth should be in the range of between 7% and 9% this year. As I indicated last quarter, based on current trends we continue to expect to come in at the low-end of the range, and recall please that this includes an estimated $140 million of restructuring charges at New Line, which we also didn\u2019t incorporate into our original outlook, and that represents about one full percentage point of growth. So when you take that into account, we\u2019d actually be tracking right in the middle of the range. ", "Given our first half actuals, that also means that we do expect our second half OIBDA growth rate to improve versus the growth rate we experienced in the first half. ", "Next, in addition we reaffirm that free cash flow should be at or above $4.5 billion and in light of the very strong conversion levels so far this year, we\u2019re extremely confident that we\u2019ll be able to achieve this. ", "Last, we also reaffirm that diluted EPS should be in the range of $1.07 to $1.11. Accounting for items that are affecting year-over-year comparability, this represents solid double-digit growth over last year. ", "I would also point out that we are reaffirming both EPS and free cash flow outlooks despite the higher financing and other separation related costs that we are incurring this year, tied to the cable separation. ", "Turning now to our balance sheet, next slide, we ended the quarter with $34.6 billion of net debt. That\u2019s about flat compared to where we were last quarter. Year-to-date, net debt is down about $1 billion. That\u2019s due to $2.9 billion of free cash flow generation offset in part by about $1.3 billion in acquisitions and $450 million in dividend payments. ", "As you know, in June Time Warner Cable completed a $5 billion bond offering. This allowed them to reduce the amount of bridge financing required to pay the planned special dividend and importantly, that offering also reduced the size of the supplemental loan commitment Time Warner provided to Time Warner Cable beyond the term of the bridge facility. That commitment goes from $3.5 billion to $2.5 billion, so we are very pleased with that. ", "I am going to move now to briefly cover the key highlights of each of our divisions and so continuing through the slides, beginning with our cable company, as you know, Time Warner Cable held a call earlier this morning to discuss its impressive second quarter results. I hope you were able to listen in to that. OIBDA grew 9% in the quarter and the company continued to generate very strong levels of free cash flow. And as we outline on the next slide, subscriber metrics were very strong across the board. As Jeff mentioned, it\u2019s the best second quarter ever in terms of RGU net additions at 656,000. That\u2019s up 20% from the 546,000 it added in last year\u2019s second quarter and it also posted better year-over-year net add performance in every key RGU category. ", "And I would also like to mention with regard to the important high speed data product, Time Warner Cable added more than 200,000 net subscribers in the quarter, which is more than the net adds of the top two telco companies combined. ", "Overall, these are very, very strong results, showing both Time Warner Cable\u2019s economic resilience and continued ability to compete effectively. ", "I\u2019ll move over now to the content businesses, starting with our network segment. Our second quarter performance here is very, very encouraging and is evidence that our strategies here are working very well. Adjusted OIBDA rose 15%, boosted by another quarter of double-digit subscription and advertising revenue growth. Subscription revenues were up 10%, reflecting solid growth in affiliate fees at both Turner and HBO and subscribers at Turner. Turner has now had five quarters in a row of double-digit year-over-year subscriber revenue growth. Turner\u2019s ad business is also strong, climbing 11% with double-digit growth in both the entertainment and news segments. This growth was driven by healthy audience gains, as Jeff mentioned, as well as higher CPMs, and Turner has now posted double-digit advertising growth four quarters in a row.", "In terms of the advertising outlook looking out for the rest of the year, keep in mind that our growth comparisons will become more difficult in the second half compared to the second half of a year ago, so while continuing to deliver double-digit gains may prove increasingly difficult, we do feel very, very good about how things are pacing at Turner. The current scatter market is healthy. We\u2019re still running ahead of up-front pricing levels and we continue to see up-front cancellation rates at normal levels. ", "We also continue to anticipate that HBO and Turner taken together will deliver strong adjusted OIBDA growth this year and will likely post the strongest growth rate of any of our segments. ", "Moving to film, where we posted another impressive quarter and things look very good for us here for the rest of the year. OIBDA rose 13% in Q2. This is due in part to the DVD performance of I Am Legend, The Bucket List, 10,000 B.C., and Fool\u2019s Gold. The quarter also benefited from higher TV contributions and solid box office results from Sex and the City and Get Smart. The quarter did also absorb the disappointing results of Speed Racer and as Jeff said, please keep in mind The Dark Knight was released after the end of the second quarter.  ", "Looking to the remainder of the year, if you were to look through or exclude the New Line restructuring costs, we are very confident that we will be posting positive year-over-year growth from the film segment and this will obviously be bolstered by the phenomenal performance of The Dark Knight. ", "OIBDA growth in the second half of the year should be weighted more towards the fourth quarter, as our third quarter results will be impacted by difficult year-over-year TV and home video comparisons, and by contrast to that, that fourth quarter will benefit from the home video releases of The Dark Knight, Get Smart, and Sex and the City. ", "Turning to publishing, revenues declined 6% in the quarter as a 1% increase in subscription revenue was more than offset by a 9% decline in ad revenues. OIBDA declined 11%, essentially due to the decline in ad revenues offset in part by lower expenses and as Jeff said, and I\u2019d like to underscore, Time Inc. continues to aggressively manage its costs in an effort to both weather the current economic environment and make sure it is well-positioned to capitalize fully when it turns. ", "We continue to see softness in print ad demand, particularly in pharmaceutical, auto, toiletries and cosmetics and finance categories. That limits our visibility somewhat into ad growth for the rest of the year and right now, I would mention that third quarter print advertising is actually pacing somewhat below where our second quarter performance was. As a result, we think it will be challenging to achieve OIBDA growth in this segment for the full year but please keep in mind that our current business outlook already takes this into account. ", "Finishing up with AOL, the dynamics this quarter were very much consistent with what we saw last quarter. In the audience business, we saw very strong usage trends and continued strength in our third-party ad network business. But as expected, display advertising was impacted by the acquisition related integration issues, as we discussed with you last quarter. In the access business, the rate of subscriber declines continued to moderate, as did the year-over-year decline in subscription revenues. And adjusted OIBDA was down a comparable amount year over year as we saw in Q1, but as I\u2019ll explain, we do believe the second quarter is the low watermark for adjusted OIBDA this year at AOL on both an absolute dollar and a growth rate basis. ", "Focusing first on advertising here, total ad revenues were up 2% to $530 million. Just as a reminder, advertising at AOL consists of display, paid search, and third-party network revenue, each of which makes up about a third of the total. ", "Walking through the components quickly, display declined, down 14% to $191 million. That reflected more units sold at a lower effective CPM, driven primarily by a mix shift away from higher priced guaranteed inventory to lower priced non-guaranteed network inventory. And as Jeff said, the decline in display was due to the integration issues that I just mentioned, as well as softness in certain key advertising categories. ", "Paid search revenue improved 10% year over year to $172 million, due largely to new search products and higher revenue per search. And as the performance of AOL\u2019s -- and the performance, excuse me, of AOL\u2019s third-party network remains strong. Revenues were $167 million in the quarter. That\u2019s up 15%. Keep in mind that this figure includes acquisition and the change in the Apollo relationship that we\u2019ve been discussing with you. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, which contributed $40 million to the year-over-year growth and Apollo, which was down $43 million, third-party network advertising revenues were actually up 26%. ", "Looking into the second half of the year, we expect both the overall advertising and display advertising growth rates at AOL to improve from the pace we saw in the first half, as we encounter easier year-over-year comparisons and will begin to benefit from the organizational changes made during the first half of the year at platform A. ", "Moving to the access business for a moment, AOL lost 604,000 subscribers in the quarter. This does represent the smallest subscriber decline in any quarter since the company announced its strategy shift two years ago, and AOL had 8.1 million domestic subscribers as of June 30. ", "Its adjusted OIBDA in the quarter was $350 million. That\u2019s down 28% versus the year-ago period. That was due to both difficult comparisons in the quarter in our access business and continuing advertising mix shift toward our third-party network, which has resulted in higher traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. We expect to see an improvement in the rate of adjusted OIBDA growth in the second half as comparisons get easier, advertising revenue growth improves, and we continue to tightly control costs. ", "Finishing up with a quick look at corporate spending on the next slide, as you know, corporate is an area where we have committed to reduce our overall level of spending. During the second quarter, corporate overhead declined 13% year-on-year and as Jeff just mentioned, we are now tracking ahead of our target of reducing corporate expenses by $50 million this year, or about 15%. Beyond this goal, we\u2019re keeping a tight rein on expenses and that will continue to be a way of doing business for us. ", "So thanks and let me turn the call over to Doug as we\u2019ll start the Q&A portion. ", "Doug Shapiro", "Thanks. Can we turn to the Q&A, and please try to limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many callers as possible. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We have our first question from Jason Bazinet, Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Thanks so much. You mentioned that you\u2019ve completed the economic split between the access and audience business, opening you up to strategic options and I just had a question on the access part of the business. I think most investors sort of contemplate the dial-up business essentially merging with another dial-up provider and then doing a spin-off. And I was just wondering if you could articulate any alternative to that strategic path that the street is sort of focused on as the most likely outcome. Thanks.  ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We have said that, and of course we will assess all of the options and I think all of you have written or read about pretty much every conceivable one. One that ought to be thought about really as a benchmark against any kind of strategic change in our position in access would just be operating it and seeing if the cash flow from that operation is superior to any yield we can get putting it into alignment with some of the usual suspects that get mentioned. ", "So we\u2019re just going to view it objectively as a business question and what we are really trying to say is that we have now organized it from an operational point of view to number one, provide the best competitive results out of the access business, assuming it operates under its current structure, and then number two to give us the flexibility to do whatever is in the best interest to maximize the value. ", "Doug Shapiro", "Can we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, Jessica Reif Cohen, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Jeff, in the beginning when you mentioned your goal, your multiple platforms globally, just curious -- given your balance sheet, what areas of interest on a global basis would you have for acquisitions? I mean, it seems like a lot of cable networks will come up for sale domestically but how hungry are you for something outside the U.S.?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Jessica, we don\u2019t like to use the word hungry -- ", "Jessica Reif Cohen - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, sorry. Bad terminology. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "-- when we talk about acquisitions, because I think we were pretty clear about how we look at those. If you just work from our strategy, we\u2019re already one of the leading branded content distributors in the world. Probably, which I sense your question is more from an international perspective, a lot of that is seen if you are living outside the United States in our branded television or online networks. ", "However, we do have a fairly large film business that supplies a lot of networks everywhere and those are the -- if you look at the weight of Time Warner right now, that\u2019s the weight of most of our international business. There are network -- and I don\u2019t want to call them just television networks because they aren\u2019t any longer, Jessica, but there television network, online network, and content production, branded content production capabilities that are at scale all over the world. And we will look at those to, as we said, from not just a financial point of view but think of those areas in which it can put us in a superior competitive position. ", "We can\u2019t really be more specific than that. We\u2019re fairly large and fairly global and anything that comes up, you\u2019ll hear us obviously in a disciplined way looking at it. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to necessarily go and do any particular thing that comes up. ", "Doug Shapiro", "Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we have Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask, Jeff, about the home video and electronic delivery business. You guys gave a decent amount of disclosure in the Q. The first half of the year, both on the television and the theatrical side, that business is growing in the teens and you disclosed also your DVD units, which I think are down globally year over year, so obviously there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on in that revenue line, which is I believe a very high margin line in the film segment, beyond just DVD units. Could you talk about that? What\u2019s driving this growth? Is this something that\u2019s specific to just the releases you\u2019ve had and the success recently, or should we look at this business as this is a double-digit growing business on the top line going out over the next couple of years?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I\u2019m going to give it a try. As you can see from our schedules and what John was relating to you, year-to-date our home video sales overall are up about 6%. The overall industry is about flat year-to-date. We think the industry will be flat or slightly up. We think the -- between the combination of standard definition and Blu-Ray sell-through, the market will be up modestly next year. ", "On the DVD shelf space question, if this is part of what you are thinking, many of the major retailers have increased the shelf space for DVD and they have added incremental shelf space for Blu-Ray high def at the expense of music and accessories. So just in terms of how the distribution at retail is going in front of store displays and the circulars have also not decreased at all, we see -- that\u2019s essentially our outlook. If you take high-def and combine it with standard-def, you may want to ask something about international but that\u2019s our overall look. ", "If you then go off of packaged home video into VOD, the margins are quite a bit better and so we think those are secular reasons why the margins can go up and the earnings can go up over time in home video. And if you add the final point which we were making in our organized remarks, our relative competitive position out-indexes for any given level of slates how everyone else does, so we essentially plan and we design our operations to outperform. ", "Doug Shapiro", "Thank you. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, Tuna Amobi, Standard & Poor\u2019s Equity Group. Your line is open. ", "Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Great. Thank you very much. I guess my first question for Jeff, can you reconcile for us your film strategy? On the one hand, you seem to be squarely focused on the event film strategy, yet you are kind of [planning] down on the specialty form, so how does the New Line and Warner Independent and Picture House restructuring kind of tie together into your film strategy in terms of number of films, et cetera? And that\u2019s the question. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Basically, we and I think most of the other studios have pursued directionally the same strategy. We have at Warner New Line consolidated our operations. That\u2019s why we put New Line together with Warners, to essentially be more efficient in a cost sense, so we didn\u2019t have dual infrastructures, and secondly to be more efficient in driving revenue by using -- by number one, taking the New Line films and keeping international rights, and number two, putting the New Line films through the Warner distribution internationally, which is stronger than where they had been going before. ", "To your specific question on film output, we basically have focused the release slates to about -- it was running, if you put New Line and Warners together, up let\u2019s say 40 or so films. And now it will be aiming more in the 20 to 25 side. Much of it Warners, with a very big focus for the economic reasons we told you on tent-poles because those are fairly economically powerful and efficient. We know how to do them and we\u2019ve set up both the production pipeline, the intellectual property of titles in the pipeline, and the distribution position to maximize what we do. ", "But we also of course have a full film company in terms of all the types of genres of films and what we are going to do with New Line is essentially have that focus on the genres that it has been successful with over time. ", "Other than that, that pretty much covers what you can say about the range of film development without going -- I mean, I get lost in title-by-title kinds of things. ", "Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Okay, thanks a lot. I\u2019ll take other questions offline. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, Rich Greenfield, Pali Capital. Your line is open. ", "Rich Greenfield - Pali Capital", "A couple of questions related to AOL; in the first quarter, you said that AOL ad revenues would improve as we go through the year. Obviously that didn\u2019t happen in Q2. I\u2019m just curious why you feel so comfortable about restating that it\u2019s going to improve from here. ", "And then two, you\u2019ve made somewhere around I think $2 billion plus of acquisitions on the Internet front, supporting AOL. I was wondering if you could give us some sense of what your ROI looks like on those investments that you\u2019ve made over those 18 months. Thanks. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I\u2019ll start and John will pick up. The general reason why we think it will improve is that we look at usage as the leading indicator and as we said, we were given some of the usage patterns in the key areas, AOL owned and operated content sites, third-party and how that is trending in economic pricing and so on, so that\u2019s essentially the short answer, and John may want to add some detail to that. ", "On the ROI on acquisitions, it\u2019s a fairly complicated thing. Most of the acquisitions or a large part before Bebo were acquisitions to fill out the ad platform, or platform A. We think that that is still coming onstream in terms of current dollar yield, but has made platform A a very successful competitor and a very strong asset in terms of the valuation of platform A. ", "On Bebo, we have a lot of plans and as we said, we are going to integrate it and take advantage of the traffic that we have in AIM and ICQ, but certain of the plans we have for Bebo, we\u2019re not going to trumpet before we do them and you are going to be hearing a lot about that over the next few months. ", "John, do you have --", "John K. Martin Jr.", "Just a small bit to add to each, and I apologize, I\u2019m part choking here. Excuse me -- Rich, with respect to the advertising, you\u2019re right. We did expect them to improve and frankly Q2 versus Q1 it did improve, albeit the improvement was modest. Looking ahead, I think there\u2019s a few things to think about on the advertising side in addition to what Jeff said. We also will benefit from just frankly easier comparisons, so that underscores our confidence there. ", "The only other thing I would add with respect to the ROI, taken as a whole, and Bebo just closed in the middle of May so obviously, as Jeff just mentioned, we\u2019re in the very early stages of our integration plans and development plans, but there is a lot going on there. ", "As it relates to the platform, assembling platform A with just under $1 billion of acquisitions a year-and-a-half ago and putting that around ad.com, which was acquired for almost $0.5 billion in 2004, we would submit that the ROI in terms of the value of what platform A is worth right now in today\u2019s marketplace is very significant. And so there is the operating side of it, which is still coming online and we are integrating and we\u2019re putting all those assets together but there is the scarcity value of having an at scale online display ad platform which we think those acquisitions were very, very prudent for AOL. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, Michael Morris, UBS. Your line is open.", "Michael Morris - UBS", "Thank you. A question regarding videogames, given that you referred to its importance to the company. Can you talk a little bit about where you are right now in terms of your ability to develop or produce videogames with respect to staffing and capacity versus where you would like to be? Is it something that you can grow organically, something you\u2019d make small or large acquisitions on?", "And then along those lines, what do you see Time Warner, the existing Time Warner company bringing to the videogame business. Why as an investor do I like the concept of Time Warner owned videogame investment versus a pure play videogame investment. Thank you. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We\u2019re pursuing basically two significant changes in the games business. One is we\u2019re going to push to establish ourselves as a third-party distributor, which we\u2019ve already done fairly successfully in the home video business for other people\u2019s product, but it\u2019s less common right now in gaming. ", "And second, we are using some [felt] type financing to manage the risks, some of  which we got, for example, out of Abu Dhabi. But what we are doing strategically is we are leveraging our own IP, the titles coming out of Warners. We\u2019re developing some new IP in partnerships with other games companies, some of whom we have either distribution arrangements with or some we have minority equity positions with. Some we have majority in. ", "We acquired TT Games, which was the maker of Lego Indiana Jones and Lego Star Wars, and Batman is coming up, as I mentioned. We got the North American distribution rights for Code Masters, which is a U.K. based videogames publisher. We have a small interest in something called Brash Entertainment, which is a videogames publisher, and I mentioned we have the arrangement with our strategic partner in Abu Dhabi who is funding up to $250 million to co-finance the development of up to 75 games over the next seven years. We also have an investment in [Syidos], which is a U.K. games developer, and we distribute all of these. ", "So there\u2019s co-development, there are game companies that we have different degrees of ownership in, all of it focused on getting the scale and distribution and to your question of whether we have what we need in terms of human talent in our organization inside the company, you know, it\u2019s something we work on all the time. We are developing at a pace with the size of our distribution presence, and we feel that we are in reasonably good shape. If you are asking whether we can attract talent that we need, we think we can. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. I\u2019m just interested in John\u2019s comments on the mix shift at AOL display from guaranteed to non-guaranteed. How far along are we in this mix shift and how much do you think it impacted display ad sales in the quarter?", "John K. Martin Jr.", "Actually, tough to tell and I think it\u2019s in part because we have so much going on at AOL and there was so much organizationally happening at platform A this year -- this quarter, rather, excuse me, that it\u2019s difficult for us to ascertain how much of it is being driven by the market versus how much of it was happening just as a result of the organizational progress that we are making. So we are going to be looking closely at this in the back part of the year and trying to understand better the organic trends and trying to improve our overall sell-through rates on the guaranteed part of the inventory, so more to come on that. ", "Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank", "And then could I just follow-on? Any concern about the pace of TAC expense increase?", "John K. Martin Jr.", "I don\u2019t think so. I think if you look at TAC as a percent of ad revenues, it\u2019s held pretty constant, around a third or about 35% and we\u2019ve got a decent amount of visibility on that and obviously we\u2019ve got our own projections as to how fast the third-party network is going to grow and there\u2019s an associated TAC along with that. But I think we\u2019ve got decent visibility on how that\u2019s progressing. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Imran Khan, J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.", "Imran Khan - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you for taking my question. One question about network business -- could you please give us some color what kind of margin improvement opportunity you see in the network segment and where do you think that margin improvement will come from, domestic versus international, Turner versus HBO? Thank you. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, we think margins will continue to improve at the network. To your question where will it come, well, we continue to invest in original programming and so essentially what happens -- and this varies a little quarter to quarter, and even slightly year to year -- is when you have a hit, there\u2019s a question of when the hit TV series, let\u2019s say, goes into your syndicated or after-market sales. And then when that happens, you have a big revenue slug coming in and it increases the margin. ", "That is on top of basically a secular margin increase that occurs because the revenues from affiliate fees both at Turner and HBO and then from ad revenue growth at Turner, which we described at double-digits, outpace the planned cost base increase. Essentially we\u2019ve been having costs growing in the low-single-digits and we\u2019ve have secular subscription revenue, affiliate revenue, and ad revenue growing quite a bit faster than that, so that\u2019s essentially a margin increase and an earnings growth driver before you even get to content [classes] from hit series. ", "John K. Martin Jr.", "If I could just add on, just some of the number mechanics, and I probably should have mentioned this even in my proactive remarks, I think it is worthy of a mention that in the second quarter, particularly at Turner, our margins tend to be lower than the rest of the year because we do carry the NBA play-offs and we carry a significant amount of sports programming amortization in Q2. To put that in context, half of our sports costs get amortized for the year in Q2 and I think two-thirds of our NBA costs hit in Q2 and I think we saw the same trend last year. ", "Looking out to the rest of the year, and we\u2019ve got good visibility with this, despite the increased investment, or the continuing investment in original programming, we are going to be comping against investment in original programming last year too, so we\u2019ve got good visibility on that and we feel good about the potential for margin expansion in the back half of the year. ", "And at CNN, margins have been and are continuing to expand there, and the performance of CNN, I think we\u2019ve mentioned in the past it\u2019s been the fastest growing network in the Turner portfolio now for some time, and that\u2019s coming on the domestic as well as the international side. ", "Doug Shapiro", "I think we\u2019re just going to take two more questions, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, Anthony DiClemente, Lehman Brothers. Your line is open.", "Anthony DiClemente - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks for taking the question. This is for Jeff. Jeff, you talked about how Warner is most aggressive on day-and-date release. Next year you are going day-and-date with every release. Now, last night on the News Corp call, Jason asked Peter Chernin about day-and-date and he said that he remains concerned that day-and-date could cannibalize the existing DVD business. He stressed the need to protect the overall margins of the DVD business. That implies to me that VOD margins are actually lower than DVD margins, so maybe he\u2019s seeing different unit economics. ", "So even if those margins are up, clearly contribution dollars per unit on VOD are lower, so it would be really helpful to me if you can help clarify some of the unit economics math there and how your strategy on day-and-date could be incremental to film profits and whether or not next year, when you go day-and-date, are you worried that at that point, retailers might start reducing shelf space? Thanks. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "No. We have not seen cannibalization so far. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to think that the margins are lower -- in fact, they are higher by a lot on rental, obviously, and it may not be the right way to look at really the profitability of a film as it goes through DVD in terms of either a physical copy or a VOD, if you\u2019re looking, in other words, per user. ", "So we think that since we haven\u2019t seen cannibalization on sell-through that it\u2019s going to increase margins and profitability going to day-and-date, and we think it will improve the position of our company and frankly the whole industry, which we believe will follow, on piracy. This is fairly similar in terms of the different views other studios have from what we did in DVD sell-through, which if you\u2019ll recall we led the same way, we got to the same result, and we are sitting today, it\u2019s why we\u2019re able to say that we out-index every other studio in DVD performance, essentially because we committed to it, developed the distribution relationships early, and went to scale early on a global basis. We think pretty much the same here and we essentially don\u2019t agree with the overly cautious view. ", "Doug Shapiro", "Last question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We have David Joyce, Miller Tabak & Company. Your line is open.", "David Joyce - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Thank you. I was wondering if there are any significant cable network affiliate contracts coming up for renegotiation to think about, and also if there are any differences in your up-front selling in this environment on the cable networks -- for example, are you selling more inventory in the up-fronts? Thanks. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "First of all, on big affiliate agreements, they come up fairly regularly. ", "John K. Martin Jr.", "We tend not to disclose them. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We don\u2019t talk about them and we don\u2019t see and I wouldn\u2019t flag any particular different situation or concern about that. In fact, we feel very good, given the strength of the networks, the performance of the ratings, the ad sales, everything that we mentioned in our remarks in terms of affiliate. We knew all our [inaudible]. ", "On the up-front, the results, I think we said it but if we didn\u2019t, please ask us if we don\u2019t answer -- if we haven\u2019t fully answered the question. We were at the top end of the entire TV universe. The CPMs were up in the high-single-digits, [inaudible] up in the double-digits. The current market is pacing ahead of where the up-front was in varying degrees of strength. It\u2019s healthy. We sold the same amount of inventory, a very key point, as we did in last year\u2019s up-front in order to get those pretty significant gains. So that was the up-front. The scatter is moving up from there, not quite as much on the entertainment side as it was in the second quarter but still up. ", "So it\u2019s a pretty good picture and Turner particularly is performing I think relatively better than pretty much all of the competition.

(Operator Instructions)  Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Doug Shapiro, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Sir, you may begin.", "Doug Shapiro", "Thank you, Shirley.  Good morning everyone.  Welcome to Warner\u2019s 2008 third quarter earnings conference call.  This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter and the other updating our 2008 business outlook. ", "Before we begin there are two things I need to cover.  First we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Schedules setting our reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release or trading schedules.  ", "These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors.  A reconciliation of our expected future financial performance is also included in the business outlook release that\u2019s available on our website.", "Second, today\u2019s announcement includes certain forward looking statement which are based on management\u2019s current expectations.  Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors; these factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner\u2019s SEC filings including its most recent annual report on Form 10K and quarterly reports on Form 10Q.   ", "Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "I\u2019d also like point out that the fall issue of  In Focus our new investor newsletter is also now available on our website.  And with that covered, let me turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug.  Good morning everybody.  I know there\u2019s some other news out this morning you may have learned something about it on CNN, so thanks for ripping yourselves away from your sets and joining us today.  I\u2019ll give my view on our progress and then turn it over to John to talk about our financial results and after that we\u2019ll take your questions.", "There are basically three headlines this quarter.  First, our businesses have proved to be resilient in a very challenging environment that\u2019s due to our business mix and to our brands and scale which enable us to make compelling contact on a consistent basis.  ", "Second, our balance sheet is very strong.  It\u2019s a real advantage at times like these.  And third, we continue to make strides toward the structural objective we outlined for you last February moving us closer to our goal of being the global leader in creating and distributing branded content.  I like to go through these in reverse order, first two are pretty quick.", "As you know, the most significant of our structural initiatives is separating out the cable business and that will make us an even more content focused company.  We continue to make progress on that transaction and we remain confident that it will be consummated.  ", "Understandably we\u2019ve gotten questions lately about Time Warner\u2019s Cable\u2019s ability to finance the dividend but as Time Warner Cable outlined in its call this morning, it has more then sufficient committed capital, committed financing in place.  So from a timing perspective the gating factor continues to be the regulatory process but we still think we\u2019re pace to close by early next year.", "The second headline is the strength of our balance sheet due in large part to the capital strategy that we\u2019ve executed over the last few years our balance sheet is very strong in terms of liquidity and capacity.  John will walk you through the details but the bottom line is that we\u2019re very pleased about where we stand today.  ", "And this strength give us both the ability to weather difficult economic conditions and it gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in the long-term competitive position of our businesses in a period when others may have to retrench.  ", "So now I\u2019d like to spend the rest of the time this morning discussing the first headline which is the resilience of our businesses.  We\u2019ve been as surprised as anybody else by the speed and the magnitude of the financial crisis and it\u2019s hard to predict the ultimate impact on the economy.  ", "But our results in the quarter and our outlook for the year show that overall our businesses are well positioned.  As you saw in the earnings release this morning our third quarter was the strongest of the year, we had an adjusted EBITDA up 9% and adjusted EPS rising almost 30%.  ", "We\u2019ve also updated our full year outlook for adjusted  EBITDA growth this morning to around 5% reflecting in part a restructuring charge that we expect to take at Time, Inc. in the fourth quarter.  Excluding the rough $300 million of restructuring charges that we\u2019re taking this year at New Line, Corporate and now at Time, Inc., we expect our adjusted EBITDA to grow near the low end of the 7 to 9% range that we first gave back in February.  We\u2019re very pleased to be able to say that in the middle of this economic climate and it\u2019s clearly a tougher climate then what we anticipated when we started out the year.  ", "This resilient operating performance stems from two things.  First, there\u2019s our asset mix which give us diverse revenue streams.  Most of our revenue comes from our content and subscription businesses which have historically been largely insulted from macro economic swings.  ", "Less then 22% of revenue comes from advertising today and even if you were to exclude Time Warner Cable our advertising piece is really about a quarter of our revenue.  But let\u2019s go in to the ad position or the  ad revenue, even where we have ad exposure we\u2019re relatively well positioned.  More then a third of our advertising comes from our cable networks business.  ", "While Turner would not be immune to a prolonged ad down-turn, it is advantageously situated within both the television business and in relation to most other ad based businesses as is shown by its recent outstanding results.  And we have almost no local advertising the local cable ads in the cable company.  So that\u2019s the first part of the resilience.", "The second part of our resilience reflects our ability to make compelling content on a consistent basis.  You know, companies claim that and reach for it and always been the core of Time Warner but its more important today then ever because as media consumption shifts, hits are growing in value.  ", "Consumers have more choice in how, when and where they use media and they\u2019re using that choice to gravitate both to the niche content and to the biggest hits.  We\u2019re seeing evidence of this shift toward to hits on traditional platforms and on new digital platforms and we\u2019re seeing it in the United States and overseas.  ", "We fundamentally believe that we can position our company structurally to make better more popular content on a more consistent basis.  And the reason is that our brands and our scale enable us to invest more in development and innovation which provides better economics, which in turn attracts talent, that increases the quality and success rates of what we do, that builds brand equity and drives audiences which fuels further investment  attracts further talents essential a virtuous circle.  ", "A few example of that starting with our networks, we had another great quarter obviously in our networks business including 9% ad growth we had another quarter of double digit affiliate revenue growth and as you know, record adjusted EBITDA earnings growth.  ", "But let's focus on a few key brands to see the grand scale dynamic working.  At CNN which I think is the right one to start with on a day like this we\u2019ve invested to build the largest news gathering infrastructure of any network, broadcast or cable in the news business and that effort has clearly paid off.  ", "This quarter CNN reach in its key demographic was 20% better then its nearest competitor.  CNN.com was the leading news source on the web as ranked by Unique Visitors and CNN Keynote coverage of the Democratic Convention was the number one across all of television.  That\u2019s the first time in history that a cable network has done that. ", "Moving over to the entertainment networks, TNT and TBS, the scale of those networks has also allowed us to invest in the highest quality original and syndicated acquired content.  For example, Raising the Bar, a new original on TNT, set a record this quarter as ad supported cable\u2019s top new series launch ever and The Closer, another original drama on TNT is the number one ad supported cable series ever.  ", "And TBS now claims four of the five sitcoms on cable, including the number original comedy on cable, Tyler Perry's House of Pain.  HBO is another great example of our strategy.  It pioneered the idea of reinvesting part of its big base of affiliate fees into original programming.  ", "Since then, the HBO brand has become synonymous with the highest quality television and not coincidentally, it is grown to be one of the most profitable networks in the world and is three times larger then its next largest competitor in paid TV.  ", "It\u2019s no accident HBO took home a quarter of all Emmy Awards this year, just one network.  And as we speak today, HBO is building on this lead, it has more pilots in development now then at any time in its history and several of HBO\u2019s new shows are building strong momentum.  True Blood which launched in September is on track and currently is the third most popular series that HBO has ever had right behind the Sopranos and Sex in the City.", "Turning to our film business, it posted another strong quarter growing adjusted EBITDA on top of strong earnings from last year.  Warner Brothers ability to operate at industry leading scale of production and industry leading scale in marketing and distribution improves our economics and those of our participants and that enables us to attract the talent that makes the best films and the best television series.  ", "Last quarter I mentioned that our studios have produced eight of the top 15 highest grossing films of all time.  No other studio has produced more then two.  This year we have the number one share at the box office, the number one share in standard DVD sell through, the number one share in Blue Ray sell through and the number one share in VOD.  And keep in mind that the Dark Knight is only included in those box office numbers not in the others because it hasn\u2019t yet been distributed into the other windows yet.  ", "These advantages that was film are also evident in our TV series production business.  Warner Brothers TV is the largest independent supplier of scripted show to the major broadcast networks.  And similar to the film studio that scale and development in production and distribution enables us to offer our participants the best economics, yielding exclusive development deals with such A list writer-directors as Jerry Bruckheimer, J.J. Abrams and Josh Swartz to name a few, there are many more.  ", "As a result Warners has the best track record in TV production.  Our success rate converting pilots into series is by far the best in the industry and just to point to a recent success, two Warner Brothers shows, The Mentalist and Fringe are the highest rated debuts so far this year in its broadcast season.  ", "Rounding out our content businesses, let\u2019s talk about publishing.  Time Inc. is clearly feeling the effects of the advertising market, with ad revenue down 8% this quarter.  Nevertheless, it also illustrates the importance of having brands at scale.  ", "People magazine is the best example.  It\u2019s by far the biggest magazine in the celebrity category, and it\u2019s the most profitable title at Time Inc.  More people read People each week than watch the season finale of American Idol, and its competition has expanded in the celeb category.  People has only increased its share.  ", "In the first half of this year, it increased circulation at a higher rate then any other celebrity-oriented magazine, and despite its size in a difficult third quarter, People\u2019s combined print and online advertising was modestly up.  ", "This again shows that as media consumption fragments, both consumers and advertisers turn to the highest quality brands.  With this strategic comparative in mind, we took a hard look at Time\u2019s organizational structure as we had done a few quarters ago in our film group.", "In general, we work continuously to reorganize the structure of our businesses to improve their efficiency and their competitive position, it will be, and it has been an on-going way of doing business for us.  ", "And so last week, we announced the most comprehensive overall in Time Inc.\u2019s history.  We are organizing our US Magazines and our companion websites into three business units that have like readership and like advertisers.  ", "This will enable similar titles for the first time to share some editorial and sales infrastructure.  It will also streamline management substantially, and speed up our decision- making, integrating as well, digital with traditional print operations.  ", "And consistent with our over-arching strategy, it will enable us to ensure that we\u2019re concentrating our resources on developing the biggest and most promising brands.  Through these steps, we expect to reduce Time Inc\u2019s workforce by about 6%, and to generate at least $150 million in annual run-rate savings, which will be realizing starting next year. ", "Shifting then from content to AOL.  The economy has also had an impact on AOL\u2019s advertising business.  In particular, we\u2019ve seen increasing weakness from certain advertising categories, specifically in mortgage finance, and domestic autos.  But there were bright spots.  ", "Our usage continues to grow rapidly, which is an important indicator of the underlying health of the business.  Page views were up 14% in the quarter, fueled by more than 100% growth at our content channels, providing more evidence that our redesigns of the last two years, and the new niche sites AOL has launched are succeeding.  ", "AOL has also re-launched AOL.com during the quarter, featuring access to outside email services and social networks.  It\u2019s already having an impact.  In September, AOL.com traffic, according to comScore, was up more than 30%, and uniques were up 11%.  ", "To sum up, while this is a period of considerable uncertainty, we believe our business will remain resilient, thanks both to our diversified revenue streams, and to our proven ability to make compelling content consistently in good times or bad.  ", "We\u2019re reassured by the strength of our balance sheet, which is obviously crucial in the current environment, and we continue to make progress towards the structural objectives that will move us to our goal of making Time Warner the leading pure content company in the years to come.  Thanks for listening, and now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John.", "John K. Martin, Jr.", "", "Thanks Jeff, and good morning.  Let me just mention that there are slides that are available on our website, which we hope will help you follow along with my remarks.  ", "Getting right into it, the first slide highlights our consolidated, third quarter results.  We posted strong adjusted OIBDA growth of 9%, despite flat revenue.  Our revenues this quarter reflect 5% growth in subscriptions and a small decline in advertising and the subscription revenues were impacted by a decline in AOL\u2019s access business, and if you look through that, subscription revenues were actually up 9%.", "Networks, AOL and film all posted significant margin expansion, and in fact, on a consolidated basis, we posted our highest margin since the year 2001.  Adjusted OIBDA growth in our content businesses, which we\u2019re defining as Time Warner\u2019s results without AOL and cable, was even faster, up 14% in the third quarter.  Our adjusted earnings per diluted share jumped 29% compared to the year ago quarter.  ", "And lastly, on this slide, I highlight that we have generated, through September, 5 billion of free cash flow.  This exceeds our most recent four-year guidance, and it represents a very high, adjusted OIBDA conversion rate of 51%.  ", "The next slide provides a little bit more detail on our EPFS figures.  Diluted EPS was $0.30, which compares to $0.24 in the third quarter of last year.  There were some items this quarter that affected comparability, they\u2019re highlighted here and in even greater detail in our earnings release.  Adjusting for these, the quarters EPS was $.031, up 29%, that\u2019s due to the growth in adjusted OIBDA, lower interest expense, and a smaller, outstanding share count due to our buy-back program.", "Turning to free cash flow, with the details highlighted on the next slide, in the quarter, Time Warner delivered over $2 billion in free cash.  It was our best quarter ever, and it represented a very high, 59% conversion rate.  ", "We\u2019ve now generated, at or above $1 billion in free cash flow in each of the past 10 of 11 quarters; so very predictable and very high levels.  And year-to-date, free cash of nearly $5 billion is $1 billion higher versus the first nine-months of last year.  ", "So to put some context around this, it took us 12 months, not 9, to generate $5 billion last year, so we\u2019re on track again, to have a record year at the company.  You may recall that our outlook at the beginning of this year was that we expected to generate free cash flow of only $3.6 billion.  ", "A couple of things have contributed to the high than expected levels.  First, we\u2019ve had lower cash taxes then we expected, due to the Economic Stimulus Act, as well as some rigorous proactive tax planning.  Second, our interest expense was less due to lower rates, and again, careful management of the balance sheet, and third, we\u2019ve had favorable working capital movements due to capital management of the balance sheet, and partially tied to lower production costs due to the writers strike.  ", "I\u2019ll point out that year-to-date, 82% of Time Warner\u2019s capital spending was at the cable segment, so if you look at capital outside of the cable segment, CAPEX represents only about 2% to 3% of revenues, which is an extremely low figure. ", "Turning to the next slide, we are updating our four-year business outlook, and as outlined in our release this morning, our outlook now takes into account the roughly $100 to $125-million of restructuring charges that we expect to take in the fourth quarter, primarily in our publishing segment, as well as the possible risk of additional pressure on our advertising businesses, particularly at AOL and publishing, and it also includes the revised outlook at Time Warner Cable. ", "We focus on three measures in the outlook release; adjusted OIBDA growth is now expected to be around 5% as Jeff said, and that\u2019s off a base of $12.9 billion, and excluding the roughly $300 million in aggregate restructuring charges that we now expect to incur this year, we would have been at the low end of the original 7%  to 9%  range that we provided in February of this year, and with the caveat that our visibility is somewhat limited by the economy, I\u2019ll also point out that our outlook implies that excluding restructuring charges, the fourth quarter should be another strong quarter of growth. ", "We\u2019ve also increased our free cash flow guidance for the second time this year to around $5.5 billion, and I\u2019ll add that this outlook is net of an expected $700 million in pension contributions this year, and that includes roughly $400 to $500 million that we anticipate that we\u2019re going to make in the fourth quarter.  ", "Diluted EPS now is expected to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.07.  That compares to our prior outlook of $1.07 to $1.11.  In addition to the restructuring charges, other items are impacting comparability such as gains and losses on asset sales, asset impairments and costs incurred in conjunction with the Time Warner Cable separation, and that had the impact of reducing our EPS outlook by $0.04.", "Let me move on and cover the key highlights of the divisions, and let me start with the networks division where we clearly had a very terrific third quarter.  Adjusted OIBDA rose 21% to a little more then a billion dollars.  It was a record quarter, and it was boosted by strong advertising and subscription revenue growth, as well as lower programming costs.  ", "Essentially, every dollar of revenue growth fell to the adjusted OIBDA line in the quarter.  Turner\u2019s ad revenues climbed 9%, and that was driven by growth in both news and entertainment, and that was mainly due to higher CPM\u2019s and audience growth domestically, as well as an increase in the number of units sold internationally.", "Looking to the fourth quarter, we remain cautiously optimistic that Turner will once again continue to post solid advertising growth.  We can\u2019t yet fully gauge the impact of recent events in the financial markets on the broader economy, and Turner would not likely be immune to any widespread protracted ads slowed down, and in addition, we expect that certain advertiser categories, such as automotive and financial services will be challenged.  ", "But having said all of that, the benefits of this years strong up-front, are kicking in this quarter, cancellation rates are running at normal levels, and while the current scatter market is moving cautiously, it still is running modestly ahead of up-front pricing.", "Moving over to subscription revenues, they were up 10% in the quarter, and that reflected solid growth in affiliate fees at both Turner and HBO, as well as subscriber growth at Turner and international expansion.  This was Turner\u2019s sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit subscription revenue growth.  ", "Turning to film, Warner Brothers posted another strong quarter, OIBDA was up 6% as the phenomenal performance of the Dark Knight, as well as lower film write-offs, offset very tough comparisons in the theatrical, home video, and off networks indication.  ", "Please recall that last years third quarter included the theatrical release of the fifth Harry Potter movie, and the video release of 300.  Those were both very successful.  It also included the initial availabilities of 2 1/2 men, Cold Case, and the George Lopez Show, and we really had nothing comparable this year. ", "In addition, despite $17 million of restructuring charges associated with Newline incurred in the quarter, margins climbed about 200 basis points over last year, to their highest level in 10 quarters, and Warner Brothers Margins were higher even than the entire film line indicates. ", "As you may know, we\u2019ve made the decision to move Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince from the fourth quarter of this year to the summer of 2009, to take advantage of the lite release schedule created by the writers strike.  ", "And that decision will move revenue and earnings out of the fourth quarter, because Harry Potter has traditionally actually been profitable for us in the initial theatrical window.  Nevertheless, we still expect strong results in the fourth quarter from the film division, as the home video releases of The Dark Knight, and Get Smart accompanied with lower P&A expense, should off set some tough home video comparisons.  ", "And just as a reminder, last year in the fourth quarter, we had the home video releases of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Rush Hour 3, and Hairspray.  And as we focus on this year, we have some pretty big and promising theatrical releases coming up in the fourth quarter, such as Yes Man, staring Jim Carey; Four Christmas\u2019s, staring Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon; and the international distribution of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, which is starring Brad Pitt.", "Turning next to cable, as you know, Time Warner Cable held a call earlier this morning to discuss its third quarter results.  OIBDA in the cable division was up 9%, and that was despite softness in its high-margin advertising business.  ", "The company also continues to generate very strong free cash flow levels, they\u2019re up 64% year-to-date, and as we outlined on the next slide, subscriber metrics were also solid across the board.  Time Warner Cable added 522,000 RGU\u2019s, which was essentially flat with the number that it added a year ago, and it did mark the 14th consecutive quarter of RGU growth, exceeding 500,000.  ", "High-speed data net additions remain strong, providing further evidence that Time Warner Cable is taking broadband\u2019s share from its telco competitors.  And as Time Warner Cable\u2019s management outlined this morning, the company has modestly reduced its outlook estimates for revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth, and it reaffirmed its outlook for free cash flow and EPS growth, and just to be clear, that revision is fully factored into Time Warner\u2019s updated outlook release that we published this morning.  ", "So let me move on to AOL.  AOL\u2019s results for the quarter were mixed.  Starting with the audience business, as Jeff mentioned, we saw once again, very strong usage growth at AOL, particularly in our content verticals.  ", "Total advertising revenues were down however, 6% to a little more than $500 million.  Advertising, just as a reminder, consists of display, paid search, and third-party network revenues, each of which accounts for about a third of the total.  ", "So just to briefly walk through the components, display advertising, on the AOL network declined, down 15% to $181 million.  Both page views and network impressions were up.  They were up substantially, and pricing for guaranteed inventory was somewhat higher.  ", "However, on an overall basis, and this is similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the past quarters, the revenue decline reflected a mixed shift from higher priced guaranteed inventory, to lower-priced non-guaranteed network inventory.  Advertiser demand in several categories was particularly soft, including personal finance and autos.", "Moving over to paid search, revenue growth there was 12%, and the number was about $182 million, and the growth was due largely to increases in revenue per search quarry.", "And in our third-party network business, revenues declined 12% versus the year ago quarter, to $144 million.  Please keep in mind that the decline related to a large customer that we had last year, Apollo, was substantially larger than the contribution from any acquisitions that we made during the quarter, so that\u2019s a drag on the results.  ", "The acquisitions contribute $29 million to the year-over-year growth, and Apollo was down $55 million.  So if you look through that, third party network advertising revenues were actually up 7%.  Now the 7% growth is lower than what we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters, and that\u2019s due to both the decline in branded advertising as well as lower consumer response to our performance advertising.", "Just mentioning for a moment the Access business, AOL subscribers declined by 634,000, and AOL ended the quarter with about 7.5 million domestic subscribers. ", "Looking at profits for a moment, AOL\u2019s adjusted OIBDA in the quarter was almost $400 million.  That\u2019s down 7% year-over-year, and that was weighed down by lower revenue, principally in the Access business, as well as higher traffic acquisition costs or TAC, and that was partly offset by lower personnel and overhead costs. Total expenses at AOL were actually down 23% year-over-year, and that means that margins of 39% were actually the highest levels that they\u2019ve seen in years.", "Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect that both display and third party network advertising is probably going to remain soft, and keep in mind, similar to the third quarter, the impact of lower revenues form Apollo should remain a drag.  ", "Nevertheless, we expect adjusted OIBDA to be higher here, year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s due to continued tight cost control and management, as well as just a reminder there were some material restructuring charges in last years fourth quarter at AOL.", "Turning to publishing, revenues declined 7% in the quarter due to an 8% decline in advertising revenues and relatively flat subscription revenue.  We continue to see softness in print advertising demand, with nine of our top 10 categories down year-over-year in the third quarter, most notably, media and movies, food, retail and toiletries and cosmetics.  Readership remains strong however, and Time Inc. continues to outpace the industry, according to the most recent MRI data.", "Adjusted OIBDA declined 19% in the quarter, and that was due primarily to the decline of the high margin advertising revenue, and that was partly offset by lower expenses.   And as Jeff mentioned, Time Inc. announced a comprehensive reorganization plan, and we expect that that should attribute at least $150 lift to profit, beginning next year, once it\u2019s complete.", "Looking forward right now in the fourth quarter, Print advertising is actually pacing below where we saw the third quarter end up, and in addition, I\u2019ve mentioned the fourth quarter, you should expect that we\u2019re going to take a restructuring charge at this segment.", "Let me just touch on corporate spending for a second, that\u2019s highlighted on the next slide.  As you know, we have been committed to reducing our corporate costs, and during the third quarter, corporate expenses declined 22% year-over-year, and that marks the lowest expense quarter since the year 2001 at this company.  We continue to track nicely ahead of our target of reducing annual corporate expenses by $50 million this year, and even beyond this goal, we expect to keep a very tight reign on corporate costs. ", "Now let me move on and just provide a little bit of more perspective on the health of our balance sheet.  The bottom line is that in large part due to the capital strategy that the company has employed now for some time, we have ample liquidity, and we have substantial financial flexibility, and this part was the slide that highlights our net debt.  ", "As you can see, we ended the quarter with just over $33.5 billion in net debt; that\u2019s down about $2 billion year-to-date, as free cash flow has been partially off set by investments, acquisitions and dividends.  I\u2019d also point out that the net debt figure is higher by the $820 million that we held and invested in the reserve primary fund at September 30th, which many of you probably know is the fund that broke the buck, and our monies there consisted of about $300 million of Time Warner, and about $500 million of Time Warner Cable.  ", "Roughly, half of these amounts have since been recovered; we received them last week, and we believe and fully expect the remaining funds to be fully recovered within the next 12 months.  So we as a company, we have significant liquidity, that\u2019s on the next slide. ", "At September 30, on a consolidated basis, we had $18 billion of cash and availability, with over $5 billion at Time Warner if you exclude Time Warner Cable, and almost $13 billion of Time Warner Cable.  And please note, that this also doesn\u2019t include the cash held at the reserve fund that I just mentioned.  ", "Understandably, lately we\u2019ve been asked whether Time Warner Cable has the ability to continue to pay it\u2019s nearly $11 billion-dollar dividend, as Jeff said, the answer is yes and that was covered on their call as well.  ", "It\u2019s essentially fully financed today, they\u2019ve got nearly $13 billion in cash and committed capacity, and that is including its revolver and bridge facility.  Like all our facilities, that commitment is spread across a diverse array of banks globally, all of which are very important to the economies of their primary countries of operation.", "As Jeff mentioned, the separation is on track to close early next year.  I just wanted to add to that, that we do intend to seek shareholder approval for a reverse stock-split, which we\u2019re conducting in connection with this transaction, and as you know, if we choose a full or a partial spinoff at the distribution, that should reduce the absolute dollar of our stock price upon completion of the transaction, and so we think a reverse stock-split would be prudent, and it would improve the liquidity and attractiveness of the Time Warner Stock.", "Wrapping up with this last slide, we also have substantial financial flexibility.  As shown here, and I think we\u2019ve shown this slide in the past, on a consolidated basis, at the end of the quarter, Time Warner had debt leverage of around 2.6:1, pro forma for the cable separation.  We estimate that Time Warner would have leverage of about 1.6:1, and you can see here Time Warner Cable proform on September 30, would have leverage of about 3.9:1.  ", "In addition, other then just some very small capital leases, our only scheduled debt maturity over the next two years is $2 billion of floating rate notes that are due in November of next year, and there is no debt maturities in 2010.  The average maturity of our debt is nearly 11 years.  So with ample liquidity, substantial flexibility, we think that we\u2019re in an attractive position in this current environment.  And with that, let me turn the call back over to Doug, and we\u2019d be happy to start the Q & A portion of the call.", "", "Doug Shapiro", "", "Thank you, Shirley can you please start the Q & A, and please try to limit yourself to one question, so we can accommodate as many people as possible, thanks.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Spencer Wang, you may ask your question, and please state your company name.", "Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse Banc", "", "Credit Suisse Bancs, good morning.  I guess my one question is for both Jeff and John.  You\u2019ve generated significant free cash flow, the balance sheet\u2019s in good shape.  You\u2019ll be receiving a one-time dividend in early 2009.  Can you just talk a little bit about how you\u2019ll be deploying your excess financial capacity?  Could you just speak to how everything came about reinvesting in the core businesses versus buy-back, versus acquisitions, versus perhaps raising the dividend, thank you.", "John K. Martin, Jr.", "Thanks Spencer, it\u2019s John.  I\u2019ll take it.  I mean the approach that we\u2019re setting out is really -- it\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve said before.  First we\u2019ve got to focus on actually achieving the separation and getting that done, and then once we get the cash, we take very seriously how we deploy that capital to make sure that we are earning attractive returns.  ", "I guess I would first say that we\u2019re closely monitoring the financial crisis impact on both access to, as well as the cost of capital.  And over time, our leverage decision is going to be influenced by both of these factors, and frankly, as we sit here today, we feel extremely fortunate that we have such a strong balance sheet, and we have such flexibility at this point.  We do view that as being a real strategic asset in this environment.", "Beyond what I just said, I think it\u2019s sticking to the priorities that we\u2019ve laid out before, which is that we\u2019re going to look to fully invest in our businesses.  We\u2019ve been doing that, so I don\u2019t anticipate that that\u2019s going to take up any of our additional capacity, but beyond that, we\u2019d be looking to do a few things; one, potentially doing acquisitions that we believe would add and create value once they\u2019re put through a disciplined filter or process to make sure that they actually are additive.  There\u2019s nothing that we see is a must-have, and we don\u2019t see any strategic holes in our portfolio right now.", "Having said that, then beyond that, we\u2019d be looking at returning capital in the form of dividends and share buy-backs, and over time, that will probably be a balance of all of the above.

I have a question about AOL cost growth in this quarter.  This quarter is was actually a soft drop in the run rate of costs in AOL without a big restructuring charge; can you tell me what happened in the quarter?  And is this current cost base a good run rate going forward at AOL?", "Doug Shapiro", "Some of the cost reduction AOL tracks access as it declines, and AOL has been continuously putting through not restructuring in the formal accounting sense, but reorganizing and reducing costs.

Martin, Jr.", "It\u2019s not any one thing Michael, it\u2019s any number of things, and it\u2019s the variable cost continuing to decline in the Access business Jeff mentioned, but there\u2019s clearly the benefits due to active management.  We saw a pretty meaningful decline in costs of service which is lower personnel related and overhead costs.  ", "There were lower costs in the member services group, there were lower costs in product development, there was some benefits found year-over-year from prior year decisions to close some call centers, and there was also lower marketing and just general G&A and personnel costs, and it was all of the above.", "And it\u2019s been anticipated, which is one of the reasons why we expected the year-over-year OIBDA comparisons to improve in the back half of this year at AOL as we continue to try to actively manage to make sure that the costs are measuring up appropriately against the revenue opportunities.

The question is for Jeff.  I was just wondering if you could talk about your vision for the next three years, what asset mix will look like.  Of course, there\u2019s been lots of speculation on AOL, but if you make acquisitions, then John said there\u2019d be a balance, is your desire for cable network specifically?

We can\u2019t predict or speculate on what exactly would happen in acquisitions, and as John said, and we\u2019ve been saying it consistently, in the media business, there\u2019s been a lot of value destroyed through poor acquisitions and poor capital allocation, so any acquisition we do, has to meet some pretty stringent return requirements.  ", "Having said that, in theory and in practice, we\u2019ll look at anything that would improve our operating position and scale.  In the content business as we\u2019ve described today, if you tick them off, basically it would be cable networks, perhaps Feldman TV production, particularly international for anything we can get to good scale on, because secular growth there  is good.  ", "Small games publishers, some of which we\u2019ve been doing.  So it\u2019s in those areas, and provided things improve our position and returns, we\u2019ll consider them and we have, as we\u2019ve said today, the resources which some others don\u2019t to pursue whatever opportunities come up.", "Doug Shapiro", "All right, thank you and go on to the next question please.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson; you may ask your question and please say your company name.", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I think I\u2019m going to follow up on Jessica\u2019s question; there\u2019s been a lot of speculation on strategic action with AOL, perhaps something along the lines of a merger into a major competitor.

And if that interest exists, what are the hurdles right now, from your perspective, to entering into a transaction?", "John K. Martin, Jr.", "Well, as we\u2019ve talked about before with regard to any division, but AOL as well, we can\u2019t really, and don\u2019t speculate on any potential deal.

Thanks.", "Doug Shapiro", "That\u2019s one question for the record.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "That is one question and the answer is we\u2019re only going to make the hit movies for now on.  So, you really have two questions, one is financing the other is kind of the optimal slate focus size both in film and TV.  We\u2019ve already said on that second one that we have moved Warners on its own and then New Line in the restructuring.  ", "If you take our film slate and focus it and we\u2019ve moved from what was combines in the 40 to 50 film release number between New Line and Warner before if you include Picturehouse and WIP, all those have been consolidated and we\u2019re now more in the 25 film slate release category.  ", "So with film slates being more focused and with solid access to capital which I\u2019ll talk about now, we\u2019re not at all concerned about our ability to finance films going forward.

", "We always retain world wide distribution rights but our existing finance arrangements cover multiple films to be produced over a multi-year time frame even now and given Warners\u2019 advantage position in film and TV but in film is what we do external financing on, and the mix that we have between wholly owned films, joint ventures and distribution deals, we don\u2019t see any issue or change in how we finance films.

Well, let me start and I\u2019ll just and Jeff obviously it's your prerogative you can jump in whenever you want, but on the mechanics of Apollo, the most significant year-over-year drag that it's going to have in the growth rates is really going to be in the fourth quarter.  ", "We really did have some Apollo money in the first quarter of this year but the numbers trail off pretty materially.  You know, going ahead of that we fully expect over time and obviously the economy provides a little bit of a haze in terms of predicting exactly when, but over time we\u2019re going to be able to grow this business in a very attractive way.  ", "Given secular usage trends, we\u2019re very optimistic about the prospects of both online and mobile display advertising and in fact over time, we expect that branded advertising dollars currently spent on other mediums are actually going in part shift over into online and to display.  ", "And at AOL on the O&O side, we\u2019ve experienced strong demand for our branded vertical channels but softness in more currently bulk types of inventory such as email.  Given the economic environment this trend could persist for awhile despite the fact that we\u2019re seeing some improving sales execution at Platform A.", "We\u2019ve got more focus vertical sales and better inventory management but over time our confidence is really underscored by the fact that Platform A is providing improved targeting that\u2019s going to increase the value of all types of display inventory, improve reporting and analytical capabilities which we think can provide our publishing and advertising partners with greater insight into how Platform A can deliver the marginal yield.", "And lastly, Platform A does have a unique ability to tap into multiple pockets of advertiser demand by having the one and only today truly integrated end-to-end advertising platform.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "So, Tuna, it sounds like you\u2019re asking about bid place which is launching early next year and the goal of that is to open up the display business that we have to long-tailed advertisers which, is what Google has basically done in search.  ", "I think for the same reason that John just mentioned on having an integrated platform end-to-end that that will augment our capabilities and take advantage of Platform A\u2019s lead 90% reach in search.  I would just point out kind of even putting that into a bigger point, that really in terms of our display position, usage keeps going up so inventory keeps going up and it\u2019s these abilities to monetize improve that is going to bring long-term growth starting, you know, now in how to use ad modernization practices perform.", "Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poors Equity Group", "Alright, thank you.", "Doug Shapiro", "(Inaudible) for the next question.", "Operator", "Thank you and the next question comes from Michael Morris.  You may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Michael Morris - UBS", "Thank you, I\u2019m with UBS.  On the networks advertising in particular which was strong again this quarter, can you talk to us a little bit about some I guess unique items that could cause difficult comps.  One, benefit from the writer\u2019s strike that you may have seen in the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter this year and secondly, any ratings strength at CNN during the election, how do you look at those going forward in terms of year-over-year comparisons.  And then also can you share with us how much of your inventory material was sold in the upfront this year?  Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, I\u2019ll start with that.  I \u2018m not worried about any comps from now out.  And I think I understood your question to be are we so well in either the third quarter now or the fourth quarter  of this year that we\u2019re going to have high comps to deal with next year, which if that\u2019s the question, it's a good problem to have, I\u2019m not really worried it at this point.  ", "It is true that CNN is having extraordinary performance with fairly significant increase within ad sales in this last third and fourth quarter around the election.  We don\u2019t necessarily say that that can\u2019t continue given the vibrancy of stories that are out in world, a new administration that\u2019s going to be quite a interesting and different in terms of the change, the world financial situation, the international, including the two wars that are going to have to be managed going forward.  ", "So we would not say, if the premise of the question is that there would be such high comps from this year that it necessarily cause difficulty in continuing to grow it next year.", "In the bigger picture of Turner ads, and I said it mostly in the remarks, if you really boil it down, what you have go to the entertainment networks, TBS, TNT, big reach, the only company with two big broad reach cable networks (inaudible) audiences come off networks, big broadcast networks they come over to Turner, very strong demos and particularly good youth to trending demos at TBS, TNT increasingly unique high quality programming, not just the proven hit series we get from network television but also the originals and the sports packages that Turner had.  ", "If you put all those advantages together and you look then at the relatively inexpensive pricing that TBS, TNT offer against the networks, we think we\u2019ve got buoyancy built in that outweighs any kind of quarter-to-quarter issues that you have in your question.  ", "And in terms of the political advertising at CNN, election spending was definitely up but we don\u2019t generate, you\u2019ve got to keep this in mind, that much extra profit from high ad growth at CNN in news in kind of an election period because the news gathering costs are up.  ", "So I don\u2019t see it as something that would cause essentially a high hurdle to have to be exceeded next year.

Martin, Jr.", "It's just the only thing, more from the accounting perspective, I do at least want mention that people shouldn\u2019t expect the programming costs are consistently be down year-over-year with what we saw in the third quarter.  ", "There is a seasonality with respect particularly to sports programming and some of you may remember last quarter actually are programming costs were up because we had higher then normal amortization of the NBA costs to coincide with the play-offs.  So sports costs in Q3 were down considerably sequentially and we also had lower original costs in the third quarter and that\u2019s just more timing then anything else.  ", "So fourth quarter, you should see cost growth go back to something that is more normalized but again, I would just remind you as you look at sort of in the longer term in the way that the networks are being managed we fully expect that there is going to be upward bias in margins in  our networks as we continue to manage the investment against the revenue opportunity.", "Doug Shapiro", "Okay, can we go to another question please, Shirley.", "Operator", "Yes, and this question comes from Anthony DiClemente.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "Thanks for taking my question from Barclays Capital.

I was wondering if given you scale in the business, as you mentioned, could you try to comment.  ", "And this if for John and Jeff, please if you could try to comment on how the recession effects home video whether it be pricing or volume a shift to rental behavior perhaps, a higher take-up on day-in-day or VOD in general or any other trends you might be seeing.  Thanks a lot for taking the question.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes thank you and let me start and then John has a point or two, it\u2019s more then a point or two.  We\u2019ve seen reduced foot traffic at retail where DVDs are.  We\u2019re watching closely to see whether there\u2019s for what kind of impact that may have on home video sales.  So, I can give you, or John will give you a couple of numbers on it.  ", "Essentially the industry is down a little bit but we\u2019re up so, so far so good.  We\u2019ve been out, well, I guess I jumped into it, we\u2019ve been outperforming the industry lately.  The U.S. consumer spending on home video as 13 and a half billion it was down about 2.5% year to date versus the prior year and consumer spending at Warner Home Video Software was $2.7 billion an increased 7% so as I mentioned in the opening remarks, Warner was number one year to date with a 20.5 share of DVD sale in the U.S, up from last year.  ", "Generally, and this goes beyond DVD sales to movie tickets, those kinds of home entertainment options, movie tickets particularly, seems to be fairly resistant to economic downturns.  Doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there totally resistant but relatively so and so that would be the general view.  Do you want to add anything to that?", "John K. Martin, Jr.", "No, I think you hit the biggest numbers.  I mean, what we don\u2019t know in the fourth quarter yet is exactly what if any impact there maybe just on DVD catalog in particular because we do believe that A titles are going to still sell very, very well and we fully anticipate that we\u2019re going to shift a lot of units of titles such as the Dark Knight.  ", "The only other thing that sort of going out that is going to impact next year too, is you\u2019re beginning to see a real ramp in electronic sale through revenues.  Where, you know, this year, year to date it approaching almost $300 million and more then doubling year-over-year so that\u2019s helping to buoy any potential down-draft in DVD.  So, you know, I think as Jeff said, we\u2019ve got a real leadership position here and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about the economy but we\u2019re very confident in our competitor position.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, we should add, because I don\u2019t want us to be too positive about it.  The real question I think you\u2019re asking is will there be a significant, let\u2019s not go all the way to severe, effect of this economic situation on say DVDs and nobody really knows that yet and Christmas is going to be very important to the extent people buy fewer players and that they don\u2019t buy quite as many catalog titles as John just said at Christmas.  ", "That could cause some reduction, there is one offsetting kind of general point which is that it maybe that the players are coming out under $20 which could hold up the sales a little bit.  So I think that both things are going on.  All of us, and your question says it, are looking for what kind of negative impact will there be.  We think there will be some, we\u2019re not sure how much and we think we\u2019ll do better then others whatever it is.", "Doug Shapiro", "It looks like we ran over by a minute of so but can we just take the last question please?", "Operator", "Thank you and this question comes from Imran Khan.  You may ask your question, please state your company name.", "Imran Khan - JP Morgan", "Yes, hi, thank you for taking my question, Imran Khan from JP Morgan.  A quick question on the AOL front, you know you clearly improved the margin significantly by effectively managing cost of that business and as you look at the business, what other areas of cost saving you see from the business if the advertising market remains soft?  Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, I can start.  I mean, look, you know at this point, we\u2019re going to continue and the management team there has been and is going to continue to manage the cost base as I said against the revenue opportunity.  ", "If you look at the access business where the rate of the client and revenues is actually moderating, access already has very high margins and is a variable cost component, so the variable costs will come down, marketing will continue to down but the rate of changing cost there is probably going to become less significant.   ", "And on the audience side of the business, it\u2019s going to be based on active management decisions nothing that I\u2019m prepared to go into a lot of detail here and as we think we about how to decide the business and grow the business accordingly.", "John K. Martin, Jr.", "We do think that there are some areas where we can continue to cut costs and improve margins in AOL going forward and so you will be seeing that over time.", "Doug Shapiro", "Thanks everyone for calling in and we\u2019re also available here if you have further questions, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you and this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

(Operator Instructions) Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Doug Shapiro, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Sir, you may begin.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks and welcome to Time Warner\u2019s 2008 full year and fourth quarter earning call.  ", "This morning, we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the full year and fourth quarter, and the other providing our 2009 business outlook.  Before we begin, there are a few items I need to cover.  ", "First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, our trending schedules and the investor portion of our website.  A reconciliation of our expected future financial performance is also included in the release that\u2019s on our website.  ", "Second, today\u2019s announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations; actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner\u2019s SEC filings, including its most annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  ", "With that, I will now turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug and thanks to everyone listening in today.  We are entering 2009 and I think we all know it, with the most economic uncertainty and the least visibility in most of our memories.  But, as I\u2019ll explain, we are well-positioned relative to the rest of industry and we\u2019re positioned well to push ahead with the strategy that we\u2019ve outlined to you over the last year.  ", "To remind us, put simply, our goal is to be the word\u2019s leading content company and to deliver increasing stockholder returns.  Last year we set an aggressive agenda towards those goals, primarily rationalizing our structure and improving operating performance.  The economy clearly affected some of our businesses, particularly advertising at AOL and publishing, but we achieved most of what we set out to do.  ", "In 2009, we intend to build on what we accomplished, and it is helpful to think of our priorities in three buckets: operational, structural and balance sheet management.  So let\u2019s start with our operational priorities.  ", "First, we are streamlining the overhead in our businesses to make them as efficient as possible.  ", "And then second, we are reallocating those resources to invest more in the production of high-quality content that defines our brands and makes the brands stand out as consumers face more media choices.  In fact, excluding the cable company we\u2019ll reduce our aggregate operating expenses and we\u2019ll hold capital spending flat in 2009, but we\u2019re going to invest more on content development this year than we did last year.  ", "Through these steps we intend to emerge from this period in an even stronger competitive position.  Let me walk you through the key initiative for this year which build on the foundation we put in place last year. I\u2019ll start with our content businesses: networks, film and publishing.  ", "At our networks, we continued to expand our original programming line up and enhanced the brands.  This strategy drove primetime ratings up 16% at TBS last year and up 4% at TNT in the key demos that account for TNT last year.  In 2009 we will air 13 original series, ten on TNT and three on TBS, and this includes six new series on TNT including Trust Me, which some of you I hope saw last week; Men of a Certain Age, Ray Ramano\u2019s first foray back to TV since Everybody Loves Raymond.  ", "Moving to news, CNN had an outstanding 2008 with record-setting coverage of the political campaigns across TV, online and mobile, and it culminated with CNN\u2019s election night ratings victory over all broadcasts and cable networks. This year we\u2019re expanding our news-gathering resources domestically and internationally across TV, mobile and broadband platforms to capitalize on CNN\u2019s momentum.  Consider that on Inauguration Day 27 million people watched video on CNN.com; this was an internet record for a live event on video.  ", "Last year, HBO also launched its most aggressive original programming drive ever, putting more pilots in development than in any other time in its history.  As a result it has more original series on tap for 2009 than in any prior year.  ", "HBO\u2019s programming continues to excel, both measured by critical acclaim and by ratings popularity. Just last month it won more Golden Globes than any other network and its new fall series, True Blood, became the third-highest rating HBO series of all time.  Despite all this investment, we\u2019ll hold total operating expenses essentially flat at the networks this year.  ", "So let\u2019s move to our film studio.  At Warner Bros. we keep looking for ways to improve operating efficiency while at the same time pushing to extend our leadership position.  Warner\u2019s had a great year in 2008, finishing #1 at the box office worldwide and posting a record $1.8 billion in domestic ticket sales.  It also finished #1 in home video, both for new releases and catalog for the eighth consecutive year.   Warners is leading the push to digital, ending the year #1 in the fastest-growing parts of the home video business: Blu-ray high definition, video on demand and sell-through.  We plan to maintain this momentum in 2009.", "The slate of tent poles this year includes the sixth installment in the Harry Potter series which is called Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  It has Terminator 4: Salvation, which if you couldn\u2019t tell, was the fourth Terminator; it has a new Sherlock Holmes which we\u2019re very excited about, and the Watchmen film coming out.  Looking out further, we are deep in development on a number of extensions of our existing franchises as well as projects that leverage additional DC Comics characters.  ", "The studio had a great year in TV last year too.  It produced the #1 comedy on network TV, Two and a Half Men; the #1 new network series among total viewers, The Mentalist; the #1 new series for 18 to 49 demo, Fringe; and the #1 ad-supported cable show in history, The Closer, for its sister network TNT.  ", "For 2009, Warner Bros. TV has already secured several pilot orders for new projects from producers such as John Wells, Josh Schwartz, David E. Kelly, McG, Kelsey Grammer and Jerry Bruckheimer among others.  ", "Warner Bros. is also investing to expand its interactive games business with plans to release substantially more titles in 2009 than it did last year.  Warner\u2019s did all this while completing the reorganization of New Line Cinema as well as the closure of both Picturehouse and Warner Independent Pictures, moves that are now saving us more than $140 million annually.  And two weeks ago, it announced a major outsourcing and cost reduction initiative that will ultimately eliminate about 800 jobs or 10% of our workforce there. And this will require a restructuring charge of approximately $100 million this year which we believe will pay for itself within two years of completion.  ", "Publishing, moving to Time Inc., we are similarly focused there on improving operating efficiency.  Our publishing company is clearly feeling the extremely difficult print ad market and this may continue for some time; but even as advertisers pulled back, consumers stepped up.  Time Inc.\u2019s readership grew 4% for the year compared to about 1% for the industry and it continued to be the most successful publisher transitioning its magazine content online, where average unique visitors to Time Inc.\u2019s sites were up 24% over the year before, and that puts Time Inc. sites among the top 20 most-visited sites on the internet.  ", "As you all know, Time Inc. also just completed the most aggressive reorganization in its history, moving from being highly decentralized to putting its operations into three groups.  This should pay off in 2009 and beyond, as we now expect that this move will generate savings of about $175 million in 2009.  ", "Move now to AOL, which continues to balance efforts to improve efficiency with targeted investment spending. Last year AOL felt the brunt of soft online advertising markets, as well as sales integration issues that we have discussed before.  But AOL still made important progress.  Over the past year, even as dial-up subs continued to decline, AOL\u2019s page views increased 12%, powered by a 69% increase in page views in its publishing unit.  More than a dozen of its sites rank in the top 4 in their respective categories and in 2009 we plan to launch 30 more.  ", "Last year, in 2008, AOL further reduced its cost structure by more than $600 million and last week it initiated a restructuring that will better align the audience business into three groups: Platform-A, People Networks and its Media Globe publishing unit.  This step should reduce AOL\u2019s headcount by 10% and allow us to close some facilities.  As a result, we\u2019ll incur a restructuring charge of about $150 million this year, but we expect the run rate annual cost savings from that to exceed $250 million when the process is completed.", "Moving now to our structural initiatives, our top priority is to finish what we started last year, namely complete the cable separation which will bring us much closer to our goal of being an even more content-focused company.  As you know, the chief hurdles to completing the deal have been regulatory, but we expect to get IRS and FCC approval soon, which should allow to us close the deal by the end of this quarter.  ", "Last, I\u2019ll turn to our balance sheet.  With the pending $9.25 billion dividend from Time Warner Cable, we\u2019ll be operating from a position of strength.  We have three goals in the balance sheet.  ", "First, we always want the ability to make high return, organic investment in our businesses and we will have plenty of capacity to do that.  As I mentioned, our plan is to increase the amount we\u2019re investing this year, particularly at the film and networks division.", "Next we want a strong balance sheet to support the businesses and provide access to the capital markets at attractive rates, regardless of the environment. And to that end, we\u2019ll likely take a portion of the cash dividend and reduce debt.  We are also lowering our long-term target leverage ratio from 3 times OIBITDA to 2.5 times.  We think this is the right thing to do given the change in our overall asset mix.  In the near term, we expect to keep leverage even lower than that until there is more visibility of a stable economy.  ", "Our third goal is to return value directly to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases.  To that end, our current intention is to maintain the same quarterly dividend even after the cable separation.  This represents a meaningfully higher payout commitment and it underscores our confidence in our businesses.  Our hope is to increase this dividend over time as free cash flow grows.  ", "We\u2019ll also look to restart our stock buyback under our existing authorization when we can.  We\u2019ll certainly have a lot of capacity for strategic M&A, but we will be disciplined about that.  We are well aware of our industry\u2019s poor track record of acquisitions, particularly deals that were supposed to be transformative. So we\u2019ll continue to look at any opportunity that can improve our competitive position in our existing businesses as you\u2019d expect us to.  ", "But any potential acquisition faces a high hurdle.  It would need to be compelling strategically, and we\u2019d carefully evaluate the execution risk and potential return against the alternate use of our capital, including purchasing our own stock.  ", "In closing, 2008 was a challenging year and we\u2019re prepared for 2009 to be challenging too.  In particular, as we said at the outset, we do have limited visibility into the ad market.  But as you saw in our outlook release this morning, excluding cable we think we can deliver adjusted EPS in 2009 about flat with last year.  At the same time, we\u2019re focused on continuing to drive efficiencies in our businesses while also pressing our competitive advantages.  By doing both, we expect to emerge from this period in an even stronger competitive position and our strong balance sheet gives us substantial flexibility and positions us to deliver a consistent return of capital to our shareholders.  ", "Thanks for listening and now I\u2019ll turn it over to John to go through more detailed financial projections.", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jeff and good morning.  As usual there are slides that are now available on our website that follow along with my comments. And getting right into it, beginning with the first slide that highlights our fourth quarter and full year consolidated results, as many of you know we updated our full year 2008 business outlook in early January and the results that we\u2019re reporting today are essentially right in line with the expectations that we previously laid out.  ", "To begin with, we predicted adjusted OIBITDA growth of 1% which is where we ended up. The fourth quarter included certain items that were particularly noteworthy which we highlighted in the January outlook release and included nearly $200 million, $280 million, excuse me, legal reserve at Turner; nearly $60 million of expenses tied to a large tenant in the Time-Life building which was Lehman, that declared bankruptcy; and an increase of about $75 million in reserves related to potential credit losses.  ", "Not including these, adjusted OIBITDA growth in the fourth quarter would have improved by 12 percentage points and we would have actually been up 4% year over year in the quarter and for the year.  ", "Next, our free cash flow actually ended up a little bit better than we had predicted, up $500 million higher than we said in our outlook.  This was due to stronger than anticipated year end cash collections at several of our divisions.  And in 2008 we delivered $6 billion of free cash flow, that\u2019s a record for us.  It is $1 billion higher than in the prior year and our conversion rate of 46% was also a record for our company.", "Moving to the next slide which provides EPS details, the 2008 fourth quarter and full year diluted EPS figures include a $24 billion pretax non-cash charge taken in accordance with FAS 142.  Excluding that and the other items affecting comparability, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.23 in the fourth quarter, and that compares to $0.29 last year.  ", "In addition, the roughly $400 million of notable pretax fourth quarter charges and reserves that I just mentioned reduced EPS $0.09 so it would have actually been $0.32.  And for the full year, adjusted diluted EPS of $0.99 was $0.03 higher versus 2007 and excluding those same charges in reserves, EPS would have been $1.10, which is up 15% year over year.  ", "Turning to free cash flow quickly on the next slide, this shows the details. As I just mentioned, we generated $6 billion.  That\u2019s up $1 billion or 20% over 2007.  It was even more impressive when you consider that this was net of almost $800 million in 2008 pension contributions and compared to 2007, in addition to higher adjusted OIBITDA levels, free cash flow benefited from favorable working capital changes due to lower TV and film production spending and in part, that was tied to the writer\u2019s strike. And we also had lower interest expense resulting from lower rates and higher cash balances. And as I mentioned, we saw our conversion rate rise to 46% last year, and with more than 80% of the company\u2019s capital expenditures at the cable segment, conversion at the rest of the company was considerably higher than that.  ", "Next slide, moving forward updates where we ended the year in terms of net debt.  We had $33 billion on a consolidated basis at year end and that was about $2.6 billion lower than where we began last year.  Our consolidated leverage ratio ended up at around 2.5 times and after giving effect for the $9.25 billion dividend we expect to receive from Time Warner Cable shortly, that would lower Time Warner\u2019s leverage ratio to about 1.7 times.  ", "Let me move now briefly to discuss each of our divisional results.  Let me begin with the networks where we really had another very, very strong quarter capping off a very strong year.  In the fourth quarter advertising was up 7% driven by both domestic news and entertainment.  This was due to higher CPMs and audiences, higher political spending at CNN and the broadcast of additional Major League Baseball playoff games on TBS.  ", "The 20% profit decline in the quarter includes the nearly $280 million legal reserve that I previously covered, and excluding this, networks adjusted OIBITDA would have been up about 11% in the quarter and 12% for the full year, a very strong result at the division.  ", "As for the current advertising scatter market, we\u2019re seeing pretty limited volume right now with pricing flat to up slightly above upfront levels.  First quarter cancellations ran at normal levels.  I would point out that we do have tough first quarter comparisons at Turner, due particularly to the scatter strength that we saw a year ago.  For example, in last year\u2019s first quarter ad revenues were up 13% so as a result right now, we expect advertising to be about flat in the first quarter of 2009 at the networks division, which wouldn\u2019t be a bad result.  ", "Our visibility into the ad environment for the rest of 2009 is somewhat limited, but due to Turner\u2019s operating momentum, we expect it to outpace the industry in terms of advertising performance and while we expect to see some headwinds related to FX translation at Turner, its subscription revenue growth should be very, very solid and overall expenses will be essentially in the flat range, as Jeff highlighted a few minutes ago.", "Focusing on HBO for a moment, HBO just completed a great year and had double-digit adjusted OIBITDA growth in both the quarter and the full year.  It also ended the year with its highest subscriber base ever.  Their 2009 results will benefit from the consolidation of HBO Latin America, which closed recently.  This, plus solid ongoing business trends and strong attention to costs should once again allow HBO to post healthy year over year profit gains this year.  ", "Moving to film, where Warner Bros., as Jeff said, posted another solid quarter of OIBITDA growth, capping off a really terrific year.  Profit in the quarter rose 6% as reduced theatrical and home video release schedules led to a decline in costs, including lower P&A expenses, and the combination of lower costs plus growth in gains more than offset the revenue decline.", "Revenues were lower in the quarter because of fewer theatrical and home video releases, as well as softer DVD sales.  In the quarter, theatrical releases included New Line\u2019s Four Christmases and Warner Bros. Yes Man and Gran Torino; and video releases included The Dark Knight, Get Smart and Journey to the Center of the Earth. ", "In 2007, by way of comparison, the fourth quarter film releases included I Am Legend, The Golden Compass and Fred Claus; and in video in Q4 last year we had Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Ocean\u2019s 13, Hairspray and Rush Hour 3.  ", "Looking ahead at the key 2009 drivers in film, we\u2019re optimistic about the film slate, particularly Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and as Jeff said, our TV business is coming off a strong year last year and we expect another strong year in 2009.  Keep in mind, we didn\u2019t really have any significant new avails of syndicated programming in 2008 and we don\u2019t expect any again in 2009, so at least there aren\u2019t any negative comparisons there.  ", "Our film results this year will also be helped by the 2008 integration of New Line into Warner\u2019s. As Jeff said, this eliminated about $140 million in annual costs and we only achieved about a third of that benefit in last year\u2019s results.  And we will also benefit from lowering restructuring charges here this year, although we do expect Warner\u2019s to record the roughly $100 million in pretax restructuring charges related to the major MIS and accounting-related cost savings initiatives.  ", "We remain cautious regarding current DVD trends and we expect the industry to stay challenged as long as there is broader softness in consumer spending in retail.  The division will also be impacted by FX translation and higher pension expenses, which taken together, may be a drag of about $150 million or more in operating profits based on current exchange rates.  ", "Focusing on the first quarter for a moment, we have difficult home video comparisons and as a result, we expect to be down considerably in the film line in the first quarter.  To give some context, we only have about five key new home video releases in the first quarter of this year and that compares to 13 in the same quarter of last year and as I mentioned a little earlier, last year included the very successful title I Am Legend.", "Moving on to AOL, where despite strong growth in usage and engagement, advertising declined 18% year over year in the quarter due to the tough online ad environment.  And as a reminder, advertising consists of display, paid search and third party, and each of these represent roughly about a third of the total and I\u2019ll quickly walk through the pieces.  ", "Display advertising on the AOL network was down 25% year over year to about $188 million.  There was continued softness in certain categories including personal finance, technology, telecom, autos and retail, which saw a much smaller seasonal lift in the quarter than usual.  Also, as in recent quarters, yield declined as a larger proportion of inventory was monetized through lower price sales channels.", "Paid search revenues were flat at $172 million as higher cost per click was offset by fewer queries and third-party network ad revenues in the quarter decreased 25% to nearly $150 million.  Keep in mind, consistent with what we were talking to you about all last year, this reflects the absence of a large customer, Apollo, but the results do benefit from small year over year increases in contributions from acquisitions that were made in 2007.  So Apollo\u2019s contribution declined $52 million and that was offset by $21 million of acquisition-related contributions.  So that means that the remaining third-party network advertising revenue declined 13% and this was due to softness, again in key categories such as autos and retail as well as lower conversion rates on performance advertising.  ", "AOL\u2019s Access business lost 573,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter.  This is the smallest quarterly subscriber decline since the company moved to free in 2006.  So this does suggest the difficult economic environment, at least for now, is not lifting churn.  ", "Turning to the AOL profit line, in the quarter adjusted OIBITDA was up 6%, but that was primarily due to the absence of a large restructuring charge that was taken in the fourth quarter of 2007.  As for this year in the Access business, we expect subscribers to continue their recent declines.  Assuming that monthly average revenue per subscriber stays roughly flat or steady, access revenue should be down this year between $500 million and $650 million and we expect to offset about a third of the revenue decline through access-related cost reductions.  But even with the expected decline in adjusted OIBITDA, Access is going to continue to remain a very large business and it\u2019s still going to generate significantly more profit than the audience business this year.  ", "And in advertising, it\u2019s fair to say we really have little visibility here.  We can\u2019t predict right now how this year is going to play out.  Currently advertising is pacing down almost 20% in the first quarter as we continue to see lower demand, particularly from retail and personal finance advertisers.  ", "We also expect search to be somewhat challenged from a growth trend standpoint this year. Revenue per search, or RPS, may come under pressure due to lower cost per click growth and some algorithmic changes that have been made by Google. And query volumes may remain under pressure from users migrating to aol.com and away from the AOL Client where queries per user tend to be higher.  This is a trend that we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve talked to you about before and we expect that to continue.  ", "To address these top line challenges, as Jeff mentioned, AOL has a plan to aggressively reduce its cost base, taking steps to better align the audience business into its three groups; it is going to eliminate some products and it\u2019s going it to reduce headcount by about 10%.  And we\u2019ll incur about $150 million in restructuring charges and we expect about one-third of that to one-half of that to be recognized in Q1.  ", "I will also point out that at the end of last week Google sent us a request to exercise their demand registration rights that it has for its 5% ownership stake in AOL.  We\u2019re reviewing what we received and we\u2019re evaluating our options.  Those options include proceeding with the request, delaying the decision for some time or we can move ahead to potentially buy back Google\u2019s stake at an appraised value, which would obviously be well below the value that was placed on it at the time of the original investment.  ", "Turning to publishing on the next slide, although Time Inc. has been able to grow its readership and maintain share in print advertising, it\u2019s also being impacted by the tough ad environment. Advertising was down 20% in the quarter, as we expected.  This reflects a 22% decline in domestic print, offset by a modest gain in online advertising.  Nine of Time Inc.\u2019s top 10 advertiser categories were down year over year in the fourth quarter, most notably financial, pharma, home entertainment and auto.  ", "Subscription revenue was down 9%, although this was largely due to unfavorable currency translation.  Adjusted OIBITDA fell considerably in the quarter, but this reflected in part some of the large previously disclosed charges.  Just a quick recap, the division took about $100 million restructuring charge associated with significant reorganization efforts.  They recorded the $57 million charge related to the Lehman bankruptcy and the results were also negatively impacted by an increase of almost $35 million in bad debt reserves.  ", "As we look ahead, the ad environment remains challenged.  In the first quarter, print advertising is pacing slightly worse than the 22% decline we saw in the fourth quarter and while the year over year comparisons will clearly improve as we move ahead into the year, we really can\u2019t predict at this time when the environment is going to begin to look better.", "Our 2009 results will benefit from the roughly $175 million in lower costs that we expect to achieve related to these restructurings.  And this year\u2019s reported results will also benefit from the absence of the actual restructuring charges themselves, but a good portion of this is going to be likely offset by higher pension expenses as well as negative FX translation.  ", "I\u2019m going to turn to cable for a minute, but I\u2019m going to actually be quite brief here.  Hopefully all of you have had a chance to listen to the Time Warner Cable call that was held earlier this morning where the management team there discussed their fourth quarter and full year results.  I have no intention to repeat that.  ", "Revenues in the quarter were up a solid 8%.  Adjusted OIBITDA grew 6% and Time Warner Cable added 175,000 net RGUs in the quarter, which admittedly was considerably below the net adds from a year ago, but as Glenn Britt, their CEO explained this morning, the year over year decline in net adds was partially due to the macro environment and the competitive environment, but also partially due to management\u2019s decisions to prioritize profitability over subscriber growth.", "Lastly, let me just discuss corporate expenses for a moment on the next slide.  Corporate expenses in the fourth quarter declined 28% year over year.  That means that we reduced corporate expenses by more than $60 million in 2008 and that was somewhat better than what we had expected and the goal that we set for ourselves.  This year, despite incurring a nearly $20 million increase in pension costs, we expect corporate expenses to once again continue to decline.  ", "Now let me just move briefly to talk about, from a consolidated standpoint, our expectations for 2009.  I was hitting briefly, division by division, some of the key drivers in \u201909 but when you pull it all together for Time Warner on a consolidated basis, we really thought it would be helpful to give you some context for the year. And we\u2019re doing it for Time Warner without Time Warner Cable. As you can see, adjusted EPS in 2008 was $0.66 and that excludes cable.  Although it\u2019s clearly tough to make any predictions right now, we are right now expecting this year\u2019s figure to be somewhere around flat to 2008, which means it could swing a few pennies in either direction.  ", "Let me just tell you what\u2019s included in that prediction, though. To begin with, we\u2019re considering that the tough advertising environment continues and it considers that it\u2019s essentially the tough ad environment that we\u2019re in.  And while it doesn\u2019t assume any considerable improvement, it also doesn\u2019t assume that things are going to get much worse, and it doesn\u2019t assume further bankruptcies from major customers which we obviously can\u2019t predict. But I would say that fortunately as a company we really don\u2019t have any overwhelming exposure to any one counterparty but obviously more of our customers could run into financial troubles this year.  ", "The outlook assumes that adjusted OIBITDA for the AOL Access business declines somewhere between $350 million and $450 million this year.  The outlook also includes the roughly $250 million of anticipated restructuring charges at AOL and Warner Bros. It reflects that our earnings will be negatively impacted by both higher pension expense and negative foreign currency translation, I have been talking about that throughout the discussions of the divisions but the two taken together could aggregate to at least $400 million of a drag on adjusted OIBITDA growth this year.", "For modeling purposes I would just add that we expect our booked tax rate to remain at around 38% and we also expect to be a full cash taxpayer in 2009, though we don\u2019t yet know if there will be any impact if a stimulus bill passes.  ", "In terms of our quarterly results, I suspect like most companies our comparisons are going to be meaningfully more difficult in the first half to three quarters of the year so our assumption of around flat adjusted EPS reflects expected declines in the first few quarters of this year, offset by growth, particularly in the fourth quarter.  ", "Lastly, I would just mention that we intend to effectuate a reverse stock split.  At the time of the cable separation, we previously disclosed this and obviously the full year outlook numbers here have been presented on a pre-split basis for now.  ", "So that\u2019s it, thanks for listening.  Let me turn it back to Doug and we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Okay, thanks. Shirley, we would like to turn it over to the Q&A and please, if you could just keep yourself to one question so we can accommodate as many callers as possible.  Thanks.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", " ", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Doug Mitchelson.  You may ask your question; please state your company name.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank", "", "Thanks very much, Deutsche Bank.  So the broadcast landscape is extraordinary challenging, both domestic and international.  You don\u2019t participate directly with a broadcast network or TV stations, but you\u2019re still part of that ecosystem with sales of TV shows into that marketplace.  So I guess in that light, are you concerned at all about the future profitability of your TV production businesses or any other impact on film? Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "Thanks, Doug.  No, basically.  We feel very good about the TV production business.  It\u2019s a high profit business, it\u2019s actually lower risk than the film side of the business for most participants in both of those businesses. And even though the business has changed, the dynamics are still favorable for us.  We\u2019re basically the supplier of second choice to all four broadcast networks after they buy from themselves, and this enables us to attract the best talent and make the best shows, because the talent knows that they have a shot at essentially being seen by all the four main network buyers.", "So Warner Bros. TV produced a total of 21 primetime series this current year; six of them are new, 15 are returning and Warner TV had five of the top 20 shows in primetime.  So due to that, and the essential advantage position we have selling into the four American networks. And due to the strength in the international markets where for us, for example, our average series, the production is profitable just with the domestic fees we get from U.S. broadcast first run and international first run, before you even get to home video or syndication revenues.  ", "And increasingly, on that base and given the solid set of shows we\u2019ve got at each network in the pipeline, we\u2019re now able to build more using some of those formats in terms of local language and local production overseas, which we are moving into, we have done the last couple of years and we\u2019re picking that up.", "Finally, production of original series for cable like Nip/Tuck for FX, like The Closer for TNT, is an increasingly attractive business for us and one that because of our position and scale of our big hits off-network and the cable TV networks we own that have such broad reach, really puts us in a very eager business when it comes to producing series for television.", "Douglas Shapiro", "", "Thanks. Shirley, can we take the next question, please?", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson.  You may ask your question and please state your company name", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "", "Thanks, Sanford Bernstein.  Jeff, I have two quick ones.  Following up on Doug\u2019s question on TV, your TV DVDs were actually down about 24% in the quarter and I wonder, given the widespread availability of some of these titles either online or on my DVR, are you concerned that TV DVDs may be more than cyclical? That\u2019s one.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "Short answer, no.  Basically the high end, new release, hit DVD sales have been holding up very well for Warner\u2019s, that\u2019s how they achieved such #1 positions in all of the various home video markets including the new high def markets and VOD rental and all of that.  ", "It is true home video sales were down in the fourth quarter for us and the industry. We think the A titles and the catalog do pretty well; catalog meaning the lasting hits.  The B titles have not done as well so it will probably be a bit of a challenge for everyone this year, but because of our lead position with a bigger slate, more tent poles and more of a catalog, we think we will outperform everybody else, as we have been doing. I should add we were down a little bit in the fourth quarter.  Some of the numbers, if you\u2019re looking at the trending schedules, are looking at wholesale and you may be referring to declines in retail sales.", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "", "Okay. One comment about there\u2019s some chatter about AOL selling Bebo.  Do you just want to update on if that\u2019s true or not? What\u2019s the thinking around there?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "Chatter on Bebo?", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "", "There\u2019s been some talk. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "Do you mean the excitement about the new \u2013 all the new Bebo product launches?", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "", "No, the potential that AOL would actually sell Bebo? You know, that would divest Bebo?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "No, we don\u2019t plan to sell it.  In fact, since the Bebo acquisition was completed, we\u2019ve been focusing at AOL on integrating all of its social networking and communications products, launching new products with it and consolidating under Bebo everything that we\u2019re putting in the People Networks division. And just to remind everybody what that is, there is AOL\u2019s IM, AIM, ICQ, Bebo\u2019s IM and mail. So we\u2019ve got product integration underway, we have a product launch for a social inbox at Bebo that we launched in early December.  That includes integrated email, aggregated fees, leveraging the Socialthing! Acquisition. ", "And as we have announced, we\u2019ve changed the organization and created a new unified management team for People Networks at AOL with AIM, Bebo, ICQ, Yedda and Goowy all in there that reaches over 90 million uniques worldwide.", "That\u2019s one of the areas, the whole social networks part of AOL and Bebo where we have really been able to hire top talent from Google, Yahoo! and RealNetworks in key positions and we\u2019ve been able to keep all the key management and engineers from Bebo.  ", "So over the next few months, you are going to see the second phase of the Bebo roll out with an introduction of products in the United States, a new Bebo homepage, a new timeline experience that will help consumers live stream their events in a graphical way and a very important integration of AIM profiles into Bebo. So if you can hear all that, you can see pretty clearly Bebo\u2019s very much integrated, it\u2019s not going anywhere in relation to AOL.", "Douglas Shapiro", "", "Can we go to the next question please, Shirley?", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Spencer Wang.  You may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse", "", "Credit Suisse, thanks and good morning.  Jeff, staying on the structural theme, I was wondering if you could just update us on your thoughts regarding your ownership of AOL? Specifically, have you or would you consider spinning off AOL directly to shareholders, and would a spin off structure address the Google demand registration rights? Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "Thanks.  That is -- your suggestion is certainly one option to increase the value and benefit and scale of AOL so yes, it\u2019s a scenario where we could spin off all or either of the parts of AOL.  It has also as you know, been discussed and been in discussion as to whether AOL would combine any of its assets with some other operating companies to increase scale on all sides.  ", "I\u2019m just not able, for obvious reasons, to tell you which of those courses we may end up taking and a third\u2026 or not a third as there are probably more than three\u2026 possibility is AOL can take the audience business even on its own inside of Time Warner. So I think while we\u2019ve been pretty clear that we are, and AOL management is, pretty flexible and aggressive about looking at any opportunity to strengthen their position whether it\u2019s in combination with somebody or not, and whether it would entail independence for some or all of that operation or not, we can\u2019t or won\u2019t announce it until we make the decision and do it.", "Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse", "", "And just a quick follow-up, Jeff.  Do you have a timeline in terms of how long you are willing to, I guess, wait before changing your ownership structure of AOL, or is it just open ended?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "I am not going to give a timeline for the changes that we\u2019re considering.", "Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse", "", "Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "Thanks.", "Douglas Shapiro", "", "Shirley, can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Morris.  You may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Michael Morris - UBS", "", "Hi, I\u2019m with UBS, thanks.  On the network side, 7% advertising growth in the quarter was obviously very strong relative to peers.  Can you share with us how much of that did come from political? And then also you mentioned that cancellations in the first quarter you characterized as normal.  What are you seeing heading into the second quarter there? Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "In terms of your question of how much was political and what are the quarterlies, before -- I\u2019m going to get John to answer some of that detail on quarterly ads.  Just in general, though, I would say that in first quarter the scatter market has been essentially, we\u2019ve been keeping pricing flat to slightly up over the upfront. You remember that we were the highest gainer in the upfront.  Business is booking closer to air date; also the first quarter cancellations are running at normal levels.", "It was a good year last year for political bookings due to the strength of CNN, but as I hope was clear as we were going through the ratings and ad growth at Turner Entertainment, networks plus news, there was so much strength at Turner in ratings really across both the news and entertainment sides, and so much strength in its ad sales pricing position that I think that question is very much a subset of the general buoyant position of Turner Networks but John, you might want to go to a few specifics.", "John K. Martin", "", "Hi Michael. Just with respect to the fourth quarter, obviously a terrific quarter for CNN and the news company. If you look at the overall advertising growth, CNN was up strong double-digits.  I\u2019m not going to give the specific number.  If you think about the overall growth in terms of dollars, it was roughly the same contribution that news contributed to the growth as did entertainment. And because entertainment is coming off of a bigger base, it\u2019s a lower percentage growth rate, but we saw growth across all of our properties in general entertainment and kids, and news. News was stronger, but in part it was underscored by the fact that we had ratings growth virtually across the board, so hopefully that helps.", "Douglas Shapiro", "", "Shirley, can we go to the next one please?", "Operator", "", "Yes, the next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen.  You may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Jessica Reif-Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "It\u2019s Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.  This is question really for John.  2008 had so many one-time and restructuring charges.  I just want to review the impact on \u201809 if we can and I guess it\u2019s a three parter.  The timing of the $250 million of \u201809 restructuring charges, I know you said one-third to half of the AOL charge, but when does the charge come and when do we see the cost savings? Will there be an \u201809 cost savings event? And then of the $344 million of restructuring charges in \u201808 excluding cable, what are the cost savings from that? I know you said $175 million from publishing in \u201809.  Can you just remind us what else there is?", "The final part to this last charge was the $217 million, the separation from cable.  How much of that gets repeated in 2009?", "John K. Martin", "", "Let me see if I can address the parts and if I miss something we can come back and we can revisit it again.  Let me start with \u201808, if we can, just to ground ourselves in the base and let me go through the biggest charges.  We had $140 million of charges in \u201808 related to the integration of New Line into Warner\u2019s and we\u2019re estimating that the run rate savings annually is about the same amount beginning in \u201809. ", "So we should achieve about $140 million of savings in \u201809, although keep in mind year over year that we did get about a third of the $140 million benefit in \u201808 so you only have about two-thirds year over year from a comp standpoint.", "If you look at Time, Inc. where there were a number of restructurings, but the one I think you\u2019re referring is about $100 million that we took in the fourth quarter related to the human resource downsizing. We expect a run rate savings there and actually we expect to achieve all of that in \u201809 to be about $175 million.  It may even be slightly in excess of that, but I\u2019d be a little bit hesitant to commit to that given that we still are in the execution phase.", "We had about $12 million of restructurings at corporate in \u201808, a smaller amount, but our corporate run rate savings is probably pushing $75 million plus at this point in time.  I think those are the biggies. The other things that were in the restructuring line was Lehman, which obviously is not a cost savings item but more of just a noteworthy item in terms of a bankruptcy-related thing.", "If you think about \u201809 and if you think about the film line, Warner\u2019s is going to benefit from the fact that it won\u2019t have the New Line restructuring charge and it is going to benefit from the two-thirds year over year growth in savings from the New Line integration.  It\u2019s going to take roughly a $100 million charge this year related to all the initiatives that Jeff referred to, and because a lot of that is going to happen throughout the year we\u2019re not anticipating seeing a lot of the benefit come through in \u201809.  That\u2019s going to come in ratably over two years and we would expect the combination of the next two years to more than pay for the investment that we\u2019re making.", "AOL, the restructuring charge that they\u2019re likely going to take this year, which is about $150 million, that should result, believe it or not, in about $250 million of annual savings that we expect to achieve in year. And that\u2019s due to a variety of factors including the reduction in headcount, the reduction of other initiatives that they\u2019ve invested in in the past and frankly, just a new approach to certain areas of the business.  I think that I might have hit it all.", "Jessica Reif-Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "The $217 million from cable, how much of that gets repeated in \u201809?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "$217 million from cable?", "John K. Martin", "", "What are you referring to?", "Douglas Shapiro", "", "That might be the interest expense?", "Jessica Reif-Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "No, it\u2019s not the interest expense.  I think it\u2019s like, page 22 of your press release.", "Douglas Shapiro", "", "Jessica, it might make sense for me to get back to you, if you don\u2019t mind.  Shirley, can we go on to the next question please?", "Operator", "", "Yes, the next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne.  You may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "", "Hi, Morgan Stanley, good morning guys.  John, you ran through a number of assumptions underlying the \u201809 guidance.  I wanted to just go back to networks and two questions. HBO, obviously the content there has been very strong.  We\u2019ve heard some anecdotal evidence from the distributor that pay units are down, or at least under pressure.  Do you still expect HBO to grow? I think you said strong growth in \u201809 again.  Do you think that is a base case or maybe more of a bull case given the power of the content, or are you factoring in some kind of economic pressure to that business?", "On the Turner side, just to go back, I think you said that OpEx would be flat there.  My sense is programming costs are probably growing pretty healthily.  Is the rest of the cost base actually declining? Is that headcount driven? Maybe a little bit of color there would be helpful.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "I can\u2019t resist on the HBO question.  It\u2019s not a bull case, it\u2019s a baseline.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "I think they will be so [inaudible] and wide because so far, even though everyone has an eye out for pay TV theoretical erosion, it hasn\u2019t come through to HBO yet. While it is true, since it\u2019s only January, that the lag in receivables going through that system is a few months and so perhaps you could see if there is cutting back that consumers do on subscriptions to cable and satellite companies it could end up eventually at pay TV companies.  Probably HBO will benefit relatively, or hold better than the Showtime, Starz and other competition that is likely to be the thing subscribers economize on.", "Secondly, there are a lot of features to HBO\u2019s affiliate revenue contracts with affiliates that essentially insulate them from moderate downturns in consumer subscription levels for reasonable periods of time.  That\u2019s not to say that in the long run if you had a longstanding reduction in pay TV levels it wouldn\u2019t eventually hit HBO.  But we don\u2019t see, nor does HBO management, a particular problem there for this year. Some of it does come from the strength of the programming and the position.  ", "Remember that we had the most subs ever at the end of 2008 and without getting too much into the structure of HBO\u2019s wholesale contracts with affiliates, it\u2019s just not likely to be a big problem in 2009.", "Do you remember what the Turner question was?", "John K. Martin", "", "I\u2019ll just jump in on that one.  Ben, it\u2019s John.  There are a few things going on at Turner.  Yes, you\u2019re right.  Programming costs are likely going to be up, but they will likely be up modestly because there\u2019s sort of, and I think we\u2019ve talked about this before, from an accounting recognition of sports programming rights, we expect in 2009 to recognize considerably less cost relative to what we recognized this year because there was a new contract involved this year. And when I say this year, I\u2019m sorry, I meant 2008.  ", "Despite the fact that there\u2019s going to be more aggressive investment in 2009 related to original programming, essentially it\u2019s going to offset the decline in the recognition of sports programming costs and it\u2019s not going to give rise or put a lot of pressure with respect to programming cost increases. ", "And to answer your other question, which is offset the programming cost increases, the Turner management team is in the process of putting through a number of cost reduction initiatives to try to manage that and offset that.", "I think before we go to the next question, if I might just go back to Jessica\u2019s question and I apologize, I misunderstood the question.  The $217 million that was referred to on page 22 in the release isn\u2019t a restructuring charge, but rather it\u2019s a cost that we identified as a separation cost for TWC. Essentially it relates to the negative carry on the cash that we had on the balance sheet this year. And so no, that shouldn\u2019t recur in 2009.  In fact, it will get re-classed down in the income statement into a discontinued operation.  So hopefully that clarifies that.", "Douglas Shapiro", "", "Shirley, can we move on to the next question please?", "Operator", "", "Yes, our next question comes from Tuna Amobi. You may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "", "Great, thank you very much, Standard & Poor\u2019s Equity Group.  My question is on filmed entertainment business.  Jeff, it looks like Dark Knight actually, given the performance of Dark Knight in the DVD window, it seems like the industry was looking at that as a bellwether and it came through big time on the Blu-ray as well as in units sold. ", "So I guess my question is, could you comment on the strategy for that title vis-a-vis as you look forward to your future release slate? Also any kind of trends that you are seeing after your conversion to the day and date release strategy? How did all that play into Dark Knight\u2019s strategy and how do you think that is going to play out this year?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "Dark Knight was the second most profitable film in history, close to Titanic and so the obvious thing we\u2019re going to take from it is more Dark Knight.", "", "In a related way of thinking, and you\u2019ve seen it in Harry Potter which we\u2019re proud, even though we know there are seven Harry Potter books and there will be eight Harry Potter movies, it\u2019s fantastic to have franchises that not only last that long, but where and I think Warner\u2019s you should stop and consider that Warner\u2019s has been able, with a number of these franchises and we want to do it with Batman, Superman and Sherlock Holmes perhaps, as you go along the sequels as they used to call them, are performing as well and are as original and good in terms of storyline with new characters added and new, very important actors added as were the originals, which didn\u2019t used to be the case in the old sequel business years ago.", "Warner\u2019s really did make a distinguishing choice several years ago when it moved toward an emphasis on having more big tent pole, high cost franchises.  Not to the exclusion of other films. If you look at Benjamin Button and Gran Torino that are up for Oscars this year you can see the emphasis on character-led and director-led films too. But Warner\u2019s has more tent poles as an ongoing strategy, usually three or four a year that very much affect and lifts its distribution consistency and performance and that\u2019s why Warner\u2019s has been able to earn more than other studios so consistently on the film side.", "If you go to VOD and windows that come after films like The Dark Knight and tent poles generally are increasingly important and valuable around the world through all the physical DVD release, the electronic VOD, Blu-ray and so on.  ", "So we think that\u2019s going to hold up our slate in the 09-10 period because we have such a strong slate of successes that we just came off of, as we talked about in my formal remarks, we\u2019ve got four more big tent poles at least coming this year to hold up that slate.", "The last point is the strength of Warner\u2019s TV slate, which increasingly also goes through home video, DVD and VOD simply adds to that distribution scale and the power of Warner\u2019s titles and the ability to get them all across the world.", "Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "", "A quick clarification, you said the four tent poles that you have coming up they are all going to go day and date?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "On day and date, so far the results moving to day and date have not cannibalized sell-through of physical DVD.  And while we, I\u2019m not in a position to exactly tell you on the four tent poles because it may be that in one case or another we move it a little bit. Basically to answer your question, I think most of the studio titles will be released day and date in the U.S. this year.", "Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "", "That\u2019s helpful.  Real quick still on Dark Knight, maybe this is a question for John.  I was a little surprised the financial impact of that title wasn\u2019t as big as I had expected, even despite the tough comparison.  I guess the logical question is, do you still expect a major pull through into Q1 from Dark Knight?", "John K. Martin", "", "I mean Dark Knight was, as Jeff said, it was clearly our most successful theatrical release and our most profitable title. The fourth quarter did benefit from Dark Knight.  Without Dark Knight, obviously, things would have been worse and frankly, you can can\u2019t underestimate the difficult comparison when you\u2019re up against Harry Potter in the prior year fourth quarter.  ", "We were quite pleased with where we were.  It\u2019s one of the reasons why Warner\u2019s continues to stay at the same level of scale of profitability that it\u2019s been able to do for so many years and Dark Knight will continue to benefit us in 2009, but the big title in addition to the other new tent poles that\u2019s going to really help \u201809 will be Harry Potter.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Shirley, can we just have one last question before we wrap up?", "Operator", "", "Yes, the next question comes from Tom Eagan.  You may ask your question and please state your company name", "Tom Eagan - Collins Stewart", "", "Great, thank you.  This is Tom Eagan from Collins Stewart.  Just a follow up on Google\u2019s request.  So does that mean that their search deal expires in the first half of \u201809? Secondly, are you guys talking to any other search deal providers? Thanks.", "John K. Martin", "", "The two are not linked.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "No, it doesn\u2019t mean that.  The search deal continues aside from their rights at a given point and this point they\u2019ve taken to trigger that right. So we don\u2019t link it. And as to what we may do with our search business, we reserve all options on that.", "Tom Eagan - Collins Stewart", "", "Thank you.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thank you very much for joining us.

Sir, you may begin.", "Doug Shapiro", "Thanks and sorry again for the delays.", "This morning, we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter and the other reaffirming our 2009 business outlook. Before we begin, there are a few items I need to cover.", "First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, our trending schedules.

This quarter we completed the Cable spin, a big step forward in reshaping Time Warner", "So, today we're a much more content focused company. And with the advantages of our brands and our scale, I think we're formally on track to achieve our key goals: to make Time Warner the leading content company in the world and to improve our stockholders' returns. We performed to that in line this quarter with what we anticipated, despite the obviously challenging economic environment.", "Advertising at AOL and Time Inc. especially is proving even tougher than we expected, when we last talked a few months ago.", "Home video has improved somewhat since the fourth quarter but remains challenged. Nevertheless, we posted relatively solid growth from our content businesses in the quarter with Content Group's adjusted OIBDA up 3%. And this morning as you saw we reaffirmed our outlook for the year.", "Looking ahead to longer term, we need to do four things to drive the company forward. First, leverage our brands and our operating scale to make the best content. As consumer entertainment choices increase, we're seeing hits growing in their value. And of course nobody can make only hits, but the scale of our operations helps us to achieve better economics from the content we make. And those superior economics coupled with our strong brands, helps us to attract the best project and the best talent.", "Second, we need to operate our businesses as efficiently as possible. Last year we took major cost savings steps at New Line Time Inc. incorporate. This year we're taking further measures at AOL and Warner Bros. And these are well under. This isn't just a matter of one-time reductions, we will remain as you have seen us do over the last 18 months, focused on improving our efficiency and our productivity across the entire company.", "Third, we need to expand our presence internationally, with a particular focus on certain key regions. Last month, for example, we announced an investment and a channel partnership with CME, one of the premier media companies in Central and Eastern Europe.", "This deal was a natural extension of our efforts to expand our networks globally because CME is ideally positioned to benefit as the economy there re-bounced and as the TV business in those countries continues to develop towards multi-channel.", "And then fourth, we need to develop new business models that exploit changes in consumer usage and in technology. We get a lot of questions about how the economics of our content businesses will evolve. We've always used our leadership position to advance models that improve our economics and we will continue to do that.", "I would like to give you just a few examples. Turner was one of the first able programmers to foresee the conversions of offline and online inventory and so Turner pioneered the idea of multi-platform bar. According to Nielsen, CNN is by far the most integrated brand on TV. That's the largest audience of combined television and online users of any network whether it's a broadcast or a cable network. And this broad reach enable CNN to attract more advertisers across more category in any of its competitors and to sell more multi-platform ads than anybody or consider HBO which has been consistently innovating since its launch in 1972. It was the first cable network to broadcast on a satellite, the first to offer multiplex channels, the first to offer (inaudible).", "A few weeks going in that chain of development HBO on behalf of something called HBO Go which is an online extension of the HBO service for HBO subscribers. It will use a quick and easy authentication process and offer over 650 hours of programming that's about 3 times as much content that is available through HBO on demand.", "HBO Go, is an example of an important initiative that we call TV Everywhere. The idea is simple; if you subscribe to a TV channel at home you can watch it for free on broadband from any provider wherever and whenever you want on demand.", "With over 90% of U.S. households already paying for televisions, programmers will be able to give consumers even more for their money. There is a tremendous level of interest in TV Everywhere across the industry, and we're working with several distributors on a trial slated for the second half of this year.", "Warner Bros. is also continuing to lead the industry in developing new businesses. When Warners pioneered the idea of DVD sell though, other studios bought. It became the largest source of profits in the film business. The other studios also bought when we championed VOD day-and-date, as the way to offset the maturation of standard DVD. Now, it's one of the fastest growing and most profitable segments of home entertainment. And the other studios are starting to follow Warner's league.", "Over to Time Inc., we are certainly feeling the effects of a difficult magazine advertising environment, but we are assuming that this is all cyclical and will automatically come back when the economy turns. We've been aggressively moving to right size of our cost structure and focus our resources. At the same time, Time Inc. has been the most aggressive publisher in moving its content to the web.", "Today it gets 15% of its domestic ad revenue online. That's more than any of its peers by pretty significant margin.", "Shifting away now from our content businesses, AOL faces different challenges and opportunities. This quarter we hired Tim Armstrong as AOL's Chairman and CEO. Tim is one of the most highly regarded executives in the Internet sector and he is ideally suited to lead AOL. He started just three weeks ago and we will have a lot more to say in coming weeks and months about his plans.", "But it's fair to say that Tim wouldn't have to come AOL if he didn't a lot of upside in the value of AOL's brands and its products and in its inventory. Among Tim's priority is getting AOL back to industry level growth rates, is to substantially improved the yield management and make AOL once again a must product for premium advertisers.", "He is already moving quickly to refine the company's strategy, its areas of focus and its organization. Tim will also play a key role working with us, to determine the best structure for AOL. We intend to announce our plans about that very soon.", "Before wrapping up, I'd like to finish some touch on the balance sheet. Our separation of Cable not only increased our strategic and operational focus, it also significantly enhanced our balance sheet in terms of both the strength of the balance sheet and our flexibility.", "We know how important capital allocation is to the value of our stock. And we take that very seriously in this year that we are all in. To remind you of our priorities, we start with reinvesting in our businesses which usually provide us the highest return opportunities. We also look to return value directly to our shareholders.", "As you know, we've decided to maintain our dividend after the Cable separation but it now represents a significantly higher payout ratio. We aim to grow the dividend over time as free cash flow grows. We have $2.2 billion remaining our stock repurchase authorization. We intend to restart our buyback as soon as we can, if conditions are warranting after we announce our plans for AOL.", "As an ongoing discipline we will also of course look at potential acquisitions that could improve our businesses' competitive positions. But we know that most M&A in the media sector has not created value, so any deal we do, will have to be compelling strategically and will have to clear our financial return hurdles.", "It's tough out there, in the economy, no question but I feel very good about how we're positioned. We have powerful, enduring brands, industry leading scale and a strong management with a long record of innovation. We've increased our focus on efficiency and our balance sheet is extremely strong. We're just as eager as you are to improve our stockholder returns. And I am confident that we're on track to do just that.", "Again thanks for joining us today and I'll now hand off the call to John.", "John K. Martin", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. They are slides that are now available on our website to help you follow along with my remarks.", "And let me begin by mentioning two basis of presentation points, because the separation of Time Warner Cable was completed in March, Time Warner Cable's financials are presented today as discontinued operations for the current and prior year quarters. In addition on March 27th we completed a one for three reverse stock split which is reflected in our per share results and our business outlook. So turning now to the first slide which presents our consolidated financial highlights for the quarter.", "As we expected, the operating environment was difficult. In addition to the tough ad conditions, we faced significant headwinds from the continued decline of AOL's", "access business, the stronger U.S. dollar and higher pension expense. In fact, while revenues decreased about $500 million in the quarter, roughly three quarters of this was due to just two factors: the decline in FX and AOL's access revenues.", "Looking at a OIBDA in the first quarter, FX was about a $70 million drag, and pension expense was up $30 million year-over-year, so the two together reduced OIBDA growth by approximately 600 basis points. Notwithstanding these headwinds we were able to maintain flat margins relative to last year through careful cost management across all of our divisions.", "On an aggregate basis, we reduced operating expenses by 7% in the quarter or about $400 million. Costs were lower at all of our divisions other than Networks and at Networks they were up only low single digits, and as Jeff said we remain very, very focused on cost control. And we plan to continue to drive efficiency gains.", "And if you in the quarter look at just the Content Group as Jeff said, so we're not including AOL and the numbers here, are adjusted OIBDA grew nearly 3% with both Film and Networks up double-digits, we consider that to be pretty encouraging in light of the current environment. We had another strong quarter of free cash flow converting 83% of adjusted OIBDA.", "Now please turn for the next slide for our EPS results. In the first quarter 2009 diluted EPS was $0.46 and that was flat for last year. Adjusted EPS, which excludes certain items that affect comparability, was $0.45 and that was down 3 pennies from the same period a year ago.", "Turning to free cash flow on the next slide, it was about $1.3 billion in the quarter and as I mentioned that was a very high 83% conversion ratio. This ratio does tend to be higher in the first quarter and that's due to positive swings in working capital primarily at our Film division, as well as timing of interest and tax payments. Nevertheless it's a really terrific start to the year and that highlights the relatively low capital intensity of our content businesses, CapEx for example was less than 2% of total revenue in the quarter.", "Moving onto the next slide, we ended first quarter with $10.4 billion in consolidated net debt; that's half the level we ended with at the end of last year. And this reflects the $9.25 billion special dividend that we will see from Time Warner Cable, as well as more than $1 billion in free cash flow generation. With this separation of Time Warner Cable now complete our leverage ratio is about 1.6 times and that's based on the last 12 months adjusted OIBDA. That's also exactly where we expected it to be.", "In March, we used the proceeds from the special dividend to repay our $2 billion term loan facility. And we paid down the $2.5 billion outstanding on our bank credit facilities so we ended the quarter with a little more than $7 billion of cash on hand and nearly $7 billion available on our revolver. Obviously that's very significant balance sheet capacity more than we intend to operate the company with on a longer term basis.", "In the near-term, one thing to remember is that the degree of excess capacity will depend in part as to what our decision is with respect to AOL structure among other things. And I'd also want to point out that with Time Warner Cable being able to raise debt in the current quarter repays its bridge loan, we are no longer providing them with a supplemental loan facility, so that's a good news.", "Looking now at our divisional results, moving forward in the presentation beginning at our Networks. We had solid revenue and double-digit of EBITDA growth in the quarter. Subscription revenues were up 9% and that's due to higher affiliate revenues at both Turner and HBO, as well as the impact of consolidating HBO Latin America.", "Advertising revenues declined 2% over the prior year and that was primarily due to softness in our International Networks at Turner which were down mid-teens, and about half of that was due to unfavorable foreign currency.", "Our Domestic Networks were about flat in the quarter reflecting a slight decline in entertainment and a small increase at news. Margins expanded nearly 200 basis points year-over-year as a result of a very small cost increase. And this drove OIBDA up 11% well ahead of revenue growth.", "Key cost drivers here was modest growth in programming expenses and lower news gathering costs. The consolidation of HBO Latin America also contributed the growth in the quarter on the OIBDA line.", "Looking ahead into the second quarter, scatter market pricing is about flat to upfront levels. However, business is getting booked very close to air date which somewhat reduces our visibility and second quarter cancellation levels are up over last year.", "International Advertising at Turner is also tracking the decline in the second quarter and when you add these two together we're currently expecting advertising revenue to be down somewhere mid single digits in Q2. And just a reminder last year's second quarter we had very, very strong ad growth, so in comparison year-over-year.", "Of new launch, turning to our Film division, Warner Bros. also posted solid OIBDA growth in the quarter. Revenues declined 7% due mostly to tough comps in both home video and theatrical as well as unfavorable foreign currency. This was partially offset by higher TV licensing revenue as compared to the WGA strike last year.", "In the first quarter of last year, we had 13, excuse me key home video releases led by I am Legend compared to only five this year which included Body of Lies and Nights in Rodanthe.", "First quarter theatrical releases this year included Watchmen, and the carryover from Gran Torino and Benjamin Button and this compared to 10,000 BC and Fool's Gold and carryover from I am Legend and The Bucket List last year.", "OIBIT in the quarter was up 10% that's despite the decline in revenues. And that was driven by lower P&A due to the fewer releases, lower restructuring charges and lower overhead following the reorganization of New Line. This was offset by higher TV production expenses again as compared to the strike affected quarter last year.", "Looking into the second quarter, we have very high hopes for two theatrical releases Terminator Salvation and The Hangover. However, please keep in mind that we once again will have difficult home video comparisons as we anticipate five key releases compared to 10 last year.", "We will also incur additional restructuring costs and those would be related to the previously disclosed initiatives. And that compares to essentially none in the second quarter of last year.", "Moving onto Publishing, where both first quarter revenues and OIBDA were down pretty substantially year-over-year, total advertising revenues declined 30%, reflecting a lower print advertising unfavorable FX at IPC and a decline in online advertising. Eight of Time Inc.'s top 10 advertiser categories experienced year-over-year declines in particular food, pharma and auto. And I'd point out that the decline in print was almost entirely driven by volume, which we think will help revenue rebound once demand comes back into the market. And in addition, I've mentioned that based on PI data, Time Inc.'s domestic advertising share actually grew modestly in the quarter.", "Subscription revenues were down 16%, about half of that was due to unfavorable FX and it was also affected by disputes we had with two of our wholesalers during the quarter which did disrupt the supply chain. We also did start to see some softness in subscription renewals due to the economy but this only had a very small effect in the quarter.", "The OIBDA decline was due to a number of things, the decline in revenue, offset by reductions in the cost base, following all the restructuring efforts that were previously put into effect. And Time Inc. also incurred an $18 million increase in bad debt reserves related to a newsstand wholesaler. It's worth noting that costs for Time Inc. are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year, but that advertising is very seasonal, with the first quarter traditionally being our smallest quarter of the year.", "I mention this because it makes the first quarter our lowest margin and highest operating leverage quarter, and we would not expect a similar level of either OIBDA margin or year-over-year OIBDA percentage declines for the remainder of the year, even if the ad market did not improve from Q1 levels.", "Looking ahead, second quarter print advertising remains challenged and is pacing similar to Q1. And again as a reminder, visibility here remains limited but with easier comparisons in the second half of the year, we clearly hope trends begin to improve.", "Turning to AOL where the first quarter results were also affected by the continued downturn in advertising. Total ad revenues were down 20% to $443 million and I'm going to briefly walk through the three components here.", "Display on the AOL Network was down 17% to $158 million. As has been the case in recent quarters, deal declined as more inventories was monetized through lower price sales channels which carry lower CPMs.", "Unlike in recent quarters, however, we also started to see some pricing pressure on our reserved inventory and key categories remain challenged such as finance, consumer products, autos and telecom.", "Page search revenues declined 12% to $152 million and that was due primarily to lower query volume and a lesser extent lower revenue per search query on certain AOL properties as well as lower click through rates offset increases in cost per click.", "And as we began to discuss with you last quarter, we do expect search revenues to remain pressured this year due to the continued migration of domestic users to AOL.com and away from the client as well as algorithmic changes put into place by Google that reduced our effective cost per click.", "Looking at the last component of advertising, third party revenues declined 29% to $133 million in the first quarter, the absence of one large customer Apollo and this is probably going to be the last quarter we refer to this. But the absence of Apollo contributed about $16 million to the year-over-year decline that's about one third. And since the agreement was terminated in the first quarter of last year, this should be the last quarter of any meaningful comparison for Apollo.", "Excluding Apollo, third party network revenue was still down 23%. This reflected lower demand for both performance and branded advertising on the network and retail and autos were particularly soft.", "Moving over to the other side of the business, AOL's access business lost 570,000 subscribers in the quarter and that's actually down a little bit sequentially from losses we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year.", "OIBDA was about $255 million in the quarter. That's down 37% as the decline in revenues more than offset lower tax and G&A costs. And as I mentioned last quarter, we expect that AOL will incur up to about $150 million of restructuring charges this year and in the first quarter we incurred about $58 million.", "So looking ahead our advertising revenues thus far in the second quarter are tracking down about the same level we saw in Q1 in percentage terms. And before I move on beyond AOL, I do want to make two more quick points. First, we recently received and successfully completed a consent from the holders of about $12 billion of our debt. And that provides us with much more flexibility with regards to AOL structure going forward, so we have viewed as good news.", "And second, I point out as we highlighted in our 10-Q filling today, we have notified Google of our intent to acquire their 5% stake in AOL. So while we remain open to the other potential solutions working it thorough with them, the next step in the process is an independent valuation of AOL and the process will likely take a few months.", "The next slide briefly touches on our corporate expenses, and they were down 22% year-over-year. Last year we lowered corporate costs by about $80 million on a run rate basis and the steps that we took a year ago are still benefiting us in the first quarter. And obviously we're continuing to look hard at our costs everywhere but here at corporate as well.", "Moving on to our business outlook, last quarter we said that we expected our 2009 adjusted EPS to be about flat with $0.66 in 2008, which I went on further to define as a few pennies about 5% up or down. I am taking into account the one-for-three reverse stock split our 2008 base has now been adjusted to $1.98, we still expect adjusted EPS this year to be around flat compared to last year. And I think it's fair to say that a likely range of outcome is still plus or minus 5%.", "Regarding our quarterly results, I'd remind that our comparisons are meaningfully more difficult than the first half to three quarters of this year. So our assumption of around flat adjusted EPS reflects expected declines in the first three quarters which would then be offset growth in the fourth quarter.", "In terms of the progression throughout the year, we expect that the second quarter will be our most challenging from the growth perspective. The outlook for ad growth is relatively similar to Q1, and our home video comparisons at Warner Bros. are expected to remain challenging.", "The second quarter is also our most difficult comparison period in terms of restructuring expenses, and we should also expect higher programming costs at our Networks division based on amortization.", "So, that really covers the review of first quarter and obviously we're trying to provide you some context on what we see for the second quarter and full year. We appreciate your listening in and your interest in Time Warner.", "And with that, let me turn the call over to Doug, so, we can start the Q&A session.", "Doug Shapiro", "Hi, thanks. Could we get the Q&A started?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Spencer Wang.", "Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, good morning. Two questions, I guess the first is for Jeff. Jeff, you alluded to the maturation of the DVD business. Yet digital has been a little bit slow to develop to. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit of how you can or plan on accelerating the transition to digital over next call it, one to two years to smooth out the transition from DVD? Then John you mentioned cost savings a lot and the focus on cost, can you just talk a little bit about where you see incremental opportunities to take out costs both at the corporate level and maybe divisionally? Thank you.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Thanks Spencer. Let me start with DVD. Strategy first on a couple of points on what's happening. We're number one in the fastest growing parts of the business, which are Blu-ray and VOD and electronic sell-through. We happen -- I think that we're usually at the top on the old standard DVDs too. But in those new areas, having pretty big slate and the scale of distribution that we have globally not just in the U.S. really helps us to get our product featured and get very good terms for it.", "We're pretty strong in catalogue because of the size of library and then adding the product not just from Warner but some TV product from HBO and Turner and Warner TV slate which is large in addition to its film slate. It's essentially the starting building block for how we're doing this. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we always try to be at the forefront to your question of leading the new model.", "So if you look at moving into Blu-ray or iTunes the margin improvement there is 70% up in margins on electronic rental as we move to day-and-date and VOD it's 40% or so in moving to iTunes or electronic sell-through. So that's really why we're going first on all of these transitions. And its -- and the results that we are getting, we think are going to bring the rest of the industry with us as they have in the past. So that's basically how we're approaching at to speed it up, well I'll leave it for follow up -- there's more to that question. And John, do you have the other question?", "John Martin", "Yeah. So, as it relates to costs and I guess the way that we like to think about it's not just cost cutting it's trying to wherever we can identify areas to improve the efficiency of our operations and redeploying the capital to more productive uses. So, just quickly looking across the company I mean if you look at what the studious are doing out of Warners they're in the midst of implementing and executing on a very material shared services project that will affect any number of functions. It's resulting in a material and meaningful reduction in workforce, and it will take some time to complete the implementation but we believe one it's completed the payback will be within 24 months of post completion. So a very, very high ROI.", "If you look at our Publishing business, we're going to benefit this year from the material restructuring that was put into place last year that essentially reorganized the company from top to bottom in terms of being much more clustered around magazines that make sense. And we said that we expected the benefits this year to be $175 million. I suspect that we will probably even do better than that and more obviously continuing to look at where we can save money given the challenging environment that our Publishing business is operating in.", "At AOL we're focused on continuing to rationalize the cost base against the revenue opportunity on the web business. I know what Tim is really focused on and where we need to make the right investments to drive product development and make sure we're making the most with our investments there. And we're looking at focusing and rationalizing our facilities across the industry. Even our Networks business which we don't talk a lot about, Phil Kent and the team there as well as Bill Nelson and the team at HBO have done really good job of holding down costs and redeploying it to more productive areas like programming. And so that's one of the reasons why we expect we are going to see nice margins expansion there in that line of business.", "As far as corporate goes, we've really significantly reduced corporate already. And I think the function that corporate is going to play going forward is trying to work collaboratively with our divisions to look at ways that we can across the company save additional monies by leveraging our scale in any number of areas. And you will be hearing about that in the coming months. So I think there are opportunities across the entire company. I think we've done a good job. It's one of the reasons why our results are, we believe are relatively resilient versus the rest of the industry. But obviously we're going to continue to work hard at it.", "Doug Shapiro", "Next question and I meant to say, please try to call us up to one question, so we can accommodate as many people as possible. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is come from Michael Nathan.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks. I've one for Jeff and then just a quick for John, Doug I'm sorry. On Cable Network side I wondered what percentage of revenues are now from international markets and what's the strategy to increase scale in those markets, from a HBO perspective and Turner perspective? And John if you spun AOL would your target leverage ratios change in terms of where you want to be, so that's two questions?.", "John Martin", "Yeah, just in terms of percentage revenues from international just rough justice is around -- being around 10%.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "How we got -- what's view of HBO and Turner, on HBO, we have been buying in partner shares in South America and HBO Asia and HBO South Asia. And that's essentially not only improving or increasing our financial exposure, it's also increasing our ability to direct what happens with HBO in those regions. And it is making possible future coordination between HBO network activities and some of our other networks at Warner Turner and even local ones like Clacksons (ph) or CME that we are becoming partners with. So that's one general direction in the case of HBO.", "It's worth noting wherever HBO is operating overseas it's number one in its market usually but maybe only one exception to that. At Turner I mentioned CME but, there is very strong position for CNN in the international English language news, business both on TV and online. There are some countries, in which we've in a local language. The real speed grower internet network overseas is Cartoon Network, which in certain key markets like India and Brazil that we've identified as important. It's the leading market in those populations, another huge future kids populations.", "So, we continue to both extend the programming strength on those networks CNN and Cartoon Network and then due to the things that you saw us talking about today, whether it's taking up partnerships with strong networks like CME whether it's buying Clacksons group of thematic networks In south America, and then operating them in a suite of channels, where you have not just the Turner Networks that you know in the States, but some of the ones that are specifically focused overseas. Another one comes to mind, RealNetworks in India which Turner and Warner really work on together, and we've just launched the general entertainment network in India. That's -- you'll see us doing more of that if we find good opportunities to do it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks.", "John Martin", "And Michael, on your leverage question, just as a quick reminder our stated target leverage is about 2.5 times notwithstanding the fact that we're currently operating in around 1.6 times. I wouldn't suspect if the decision is made to separate out AOL I wouldn't anticipate that it's going to result in any material change in our view as to this stated target leverage. But obviously, if AOL is on its own footing the remaining Time Warner would no longer benefit from the earnings in free cash flow generation from AOL. So depending on how AOL would be capitalized which obviously no decisions have been made there either. And you could see leverage go up to TWX somewhat, and I would sort of end by saying that and we all recognize that we enjoy very significant meaningful capacity. And it's one of the reasons why I wanted to mention it in my remarks which is that, we have more capacity right now than we intend to operate the company with on a go forward basis longer-term. But if we were to separate out AOL we would anticipate and expect that Time Warner would still have a very adequate and attractive financial flexibility and capacity going forward.", "Doug Shapiro", "May we have the next question please?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Bazinet.", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Just have a quick question regarding the disclosure in the Q about potentially buying the AOL stake from Google. Does that reflect your interest in the asset or is that just to give your company more flexibility regarding timing given the provisions the Google has?", "John Martin", "Well, I mean as you know there is a process that Google started off and it could result in registering a stake of us buying it back. And our interest in the property would obviously depend on valuation and we're going to start to move down that path. It's not a material amount of money one way or the other, I don't think it's not a huge material event for Time Warner in total. And as I said in my remarks, there is still some conversations we'll have with Google and we're open to other suggestions. But at this point in the disclosure in the Q just wanted to make sure that we said that we're moving down the path that could result in us acquiring back the stake.", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Okay. And then I can I have just one follow up housekeeping question, I guess in the trending schedule you used to give the international ad numbers at AOL. Can you give those?", "John Martin", "Yeah. Jason we can talk about that offline. I mean basically it's usually about one- third, two-third international, domestic.", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you.", "Doug Shapiro", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Anthony Diclemente.", "Anthony Diclemente - Barclays Capital", "Hi, thanks just one question for Jeff, I was hoping you could just continue to elaborate more on TV Everywhere the authentication concept. And just thinking about this potential solution, how feasible is it that you can get the distributors and the programmers together on this both in terms of the technical aspect and then actual incentive for a cable programmer be it a small one or larger conglomerate what is -- what would the incentive be for them to become a part of TV Everywhere or not to? Thanks for your comments.", "John Martin", "Okay, thanks. I think the whole thing is very simple. You've already got a billing system running efficiently through the current providers of video which would be cable MSOs, it's a couple of satellite companies and cell phone companies. They are currently providing multi-channel TV networks to over 90% of American households.", "So all the billing and all of the authentication is done already, they've all got it, it's pretty simple. Given that we're all talking about letting viewers 90 plus percent of Americans watch program when they've already paid for, having a check-in software that simply asks given consumer pay for this by pinging the cable operator satellite operators and phone operators is a very simple instantaneous thing. It's much more simple for example than an iTunes billing activation for buying something online or for Google search algorithm. And incentive for all of the distributors to join and help us this to occur is that it supports all of their video revenue.", "And so it seems pretty simple from the networks point of view, it's also pretty clear, any multi-channel network that's got to a dual revenue streams has clearly got a benefit in making that channel and brand royalty move across any platform or devices. Because, if I just speak for our company, it's good for TNT or HBO, that if you got it in your home, you can watch it out of your home and on VOD. And that we can then maintain the subscription payment you're already making and the ad sales across platform ability, that deciding in media. So, the system is simple, it's not hard. It doesn't put any blocks for consumers and it's clearly in the interest of all cable multi-channel networks, and all video providers.", "So it's really absolutely -- there's nobody that it isn't in the interest of really, and the outline at this point seem to be broadcast networks, which are in a clearly different position and have different paths.", "Doug Shapiro", "Could you take the next question please?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tuna Amobi.", "Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor's", "Great, so I wanted to ask about any update you have Jeff on the Bebo re-launch and when you think that the user metrics overall at AOL will begin to converge with the monetization initiatives there. What you expect Tim Armstrong to be focused on in the next year or so? And if I can -- have a step-up question quickly for John, do you foresee an instance with for example your so called content orientated adjusted EBITDA could decline this year and still hit your EPS targets?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "John -- on Bebo first, since the Bebo acquisition we keep re-launching key parts of Bebo. The social inbox was launched in early December and it includes integrated e-mail, aggregated social feeds. In February we launched a new home page, which had profile on it, and had your time line experience and it had our aggregated feeds platform, which is called Live Stream. Over the next couple of months, Phase II of the Bebo roll up will happen, with an introduction of products in the United States including a new desktop client.", "On usage of Bebo overall comps score uniques are up 5% year-to-year, in the first quarter, to about 24.5 million, that's driven primarily by the United States activity. But we've also seen growth in Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. The uniques at Bebo did decline 15% in the UK due to Facebook competition, and page viewers have been down across the board. So, that's on Bebo, and we're quickly transitioning to your AOL question. What will Tim do, it's little early after a couple of weeks.", "But basically as I said in the remarks he's working hard as his team at AOL to better capitalize on our existing products and content. And to build into a few of the wide space areas that we see emerging that fits AOL's core strength, some of which will keep to ourselves until we occupy them. It's a little early to talk about targets but we feel strongly and Tim does too that AOL has to hold itself being a leader in the growing space of its competitors competition with the other big companies. And we have to have metrics that reflect that growth. We have put up as you saw us announce some room in an envelope for additional restructuring. And we are moving pretty quickly as we also said to refine the organization and the emphasis in our operating resources commitment to those areas that are growing and pulling them away from those that are not growing. We do think we've got the building blocks, so for us to turn around at AOL which we see underway in both usage and monetization.", "Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor's", "All right thanks John.", "John Martin", "I'll be quick and unfortunately I am going to refrain from giving any specific of OIBDA guidance. It's one of the things we decided to do coming into the year with the difficult operating environment. We thought we had an enough leverage to manage and be able to deliver about flat adjusted EPS and as a result of that I just don't want to get into more specifics on OIBDA.", "Doug Shapiro", "Okay, next question please.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Michael Morris.", "Michael Morris - UBS", "Hi thanks. Can you expand a bit on the trends that you're seeing in network advertising especially as we head into the upfront? In particular it seems that demand is clearly a bit softer, the pricing has remained flat. So, just couple of things that I would like to figure out is, one, as you compete with the Broadcast Networks where your CPMs and some of your key programs you are offering there and what's your value proposition heading in this year? And then number two, how do you view the risk of maybe some of aggressive price competition given that it appears that demand is a bit softer heading into the second quarter? Thanks.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Okay, on the second one we are probably not --- John has been -- gives tactical responsive, now we're going to handle price competition. But just in general, we're in a very good position on television advertising competition at Turner, because we have the scale, rich ratings and quality programming environment, that the advertisers want on TV. And then we have the final weapon which is very attractive pricing in relation to Broadcast.", "So, the CPM gap is again starting to close. If you have TBS and TNT in the top three, you got the Gulfstream number one which in the adults 18 to 34 group, CNN total day ratings continuing to grow. And with the CPMs at about two thirds of Broadcast, that's a very good environment for us. And if you just look at what's been happening recently in last year's upfront, our price increases were the highest across any network group in television whether it was Broadcast or Cable.", "And so in general to your question, Cable is taking viewer shift at an accelerating pace. If you look at just the first quarter '08 or '09 versus '08 last year Cable is up over 2 million total viewers this year versus last. In this year season to-date Cable is up 3% Broadcast is down 5% in primetime.", "The primetime share of Cable is 60% versus Broadcast at 40 and yet the ad dollars are 30% for Cable and 70% for Broadcast. So that's a huge hunting reservation to go out off to and you have got Broadcast off to the worst start that's have in a decade. It's down nearly 2 million adults 18 to 49 and it's season starts are off 7%. More than three quarters of the shows returning to Broadcast are down this year in ratings.", "So if you look now at the upfront which is starting to come into play it's hard to predict with a lot of certainty but we are very well positioned given what we just said about the rich and quality and ratings of our networks. And with Broadcast getting into those kind of problems and having that much exposure on its pricing we think that our advertisers are going to be considered continuing to look at TV as the total picture and making economic decisions about where they can get banks for the buck in a good environment in terms of programming environment", "So, that's how it looks to us. We really can't go into our tactics of how we are going to use those advantages.", "Michael Morris - UBS", "Great. Thank you.", "Doug Shapiro", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Doug Mitchelson.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Hi. Thanks, good morning. So, Jeff as you consider your options at AOL, I am wondering if you have any concerns regarding your loss of synergies between your Content Group and AOL. And I guess I was not surprised but still amazing that you noted in schedule six where you breakout AOL and Content and then eliminations between the two. There is only $8 million of eliminations for revenue and none it all for EBIT. So, that implies there's essentially no synergies between AOL and Content. So, is that right? And that the second part of the question is just the 10-Q said management is committed to spin off all or part of AOL. What are the factors that are going to drive your decision on AOL since you don't have Board approval yet? Thanks.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "On the first, in terms of synergies you can't just look at synergies from financial eliminations on. They tend to rise when you are selling things through different parts of your company in a supplier-customer relationship. And that's not the only way that you can get an advantage as a branded media company with TV networks, magazine title and so forth, putting them online and having the giant audience of something like AOL and potentially ad sales coordination.", "So I would say having said those things, we have joint ventures like TMC, and a number of showcases and traffic movements that occur, between our Publishing company, our Networks and our studio back and forth with AOL, which is a huge repository of uniques and page views. Having said that, that doesn't necessarily turn into commercial and accounting hosting, because those are promotional in some cases or audience building an image building, they're not sales. And that really speaks to what portals and online services like Yahoo! and AOL are, they're not lease holders, they don't buy and exhibit rights by and large.", "So from the point of view still on synergy, of what you use can branded media products like Harry Potter, HBO, TNT make of the AOL and Yahoos and MSNs of the world, they can do that by essentially getting all of their audiences exposure to those branded products on all platforms, which would include not just AOL but the others. And that I think gives you a clear idea of where AOL will compete because it will compete on that basis with Yahoos and MSNs and all of them will be useful traffic and new form of media augmenters for things like network TV and branded franchises like Harry Potter.", "When you go to the -- you asked I think about the process and what factors we've put in to making our decisions on spin or not, basically if you ask the question what are the arguments or reasons why theoretically you would separate a company like Time Warner Cable which we just did or in this case AOL. The obvious goal is to whether you can improve the value of all stock, the entity that goes out if it goes out. And Time Warner which would be answered by -- if that doesn't answer the question. Do you improve the strategic focus and the strategic options of both AOL and Time Warner if they were separate? And do you moving more specifically to AOL improve its ability to attract and retain talents and would that AOL business as it goes forward be better capitalized and more appealing to a specific shareholder base that might be different than the one that is investing in the Time Warner Media Company. When we answer those questions to the point that we can explain them to all of you then you would -- we'll then take action and we anticipate that, that will not be too long from now.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Thanks much.", "Doug Shapiro", "Great. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Greenfield.", "Richard Greenfield - Pali Research", "Hi. Question, when you look at your Film business, there is a comment in the 10-Q that you could back ownership of four films at least temporarily and maybe more films later this year. I wanted to know what films were those, are there no longer being co-financed? And given the fact they wont be co-financed were these profitable films and therefore will you book more revenue and profit because of this or less? How does that just play out?", "And then just a follow-up for Jeff about the whole TV Everywhere thing, CNN is not just about videos, could you envision charging ISPs for access two sites such as CNN or TMZ, such as ESPN 360 does, especially as broadband outputs appear to be on the rise with higher speed broadband rolling out. Thanks.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Oh, thanks. On the four films John will answer it because -- and I will come back to that.", "John Martin", "There was another question before the TBF --", "Richard Greenfield - Pali Research", "I do not know what the -- who the co-financing partners --", "John Martin", "You want to start -", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Okay. I will do TV -- first of all Rich, I think you've been writing some great stuff on the other company. So is that -- I don't think that and if you take this specific case of CNN, while I am not right now going to give an absolutely firm answer that we wouldn't have some layer of surface of CNN that you might not have reason to charge for. So having said that in general we think that when our viewers, our network watchers have paid for a network like CNN, TNT, HBO that programming ought to be available on all platforms on demand.", "And we have basically if you look at our record on this, done precisely that with HBO when we put it on VOD. We've moved it to kind of uniform availability, some of our distributors haven't but that's what we've basically done. And so we don't really envision having broadband be a charging mechanism, it's not really the way broadband currently works. It's not likely to be if you move in that direction an advantageous trades to move charging over broadband versus what's currently existing, and that's particularly consumer friendly to do it that way.", "The way we are talking about is making it free, making it easy for people to use so that, they don't have to worry about whether they are walking in their house or looking at their TV on the wall, and then they walk out the door with their laptop or their handheld. They ought to be able to use their network, TNT, CNN, HBO. The same way on all those environments and on all those devices and the simplest way to do that is just to rely on what's already built, which is they have already paid for and it's already been collected and the mechanism is simple and reliable to do that. So that's why we believe this is a simple way to evolve the industry very quickly because speed is important to get this out in consumers' hands as quickly as possible and not have them to worry about whether they're getting this over TV steaming versus internet, broadband delivery. John is going to answer the --", "John Martin", "Yeah I'll take the other question. Look just by way of quick context, Warner's for a long time has been entering into co-financing relationships with partners. They have a diverse portfolio of wholly-owned films, JV films, acquired films and distribution VOs and those are specifically designed to minimize financial risks of maintaining upside. And our existing financing agreements typically cover multiple films that are produced over a multiyear timeframe. It is true as we disclosed in the Q that one of our largest co-financing partners has not been able to up until now fund its share of the production costs on certain films and as you mentioned it's four films.", "They are still in the process of trying to obtain their financing, if they do, great. We've had a longstanding relationship with them. I would prefer not to mention who it is specifically because I am not sure they would appreciate that. And I prefer as accordingly not to mention the specific films but as you said in the Q it's four films.", "It will not have a meaningful impact to our P&L one way or the other. It would in the near term have more of an impact on cash because we would recoup some of the cash that we've been funding. But if for whatever reason they can't obtain financing, we're also not that concerned about our ability to finance films going forward given the flexibility and given our position in the industry. So, hope that's enough on that.", "Doug Shapiro", "Let's take the last question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jessica Reif-Cohen.", "Jessica Reif-Cohen - BAS-ML", "Hi, thank you. I am wondering if you could comment, probably for Jeff, how you see your asset mix changing momentum, which clearly you're on a path of -- or AOL in the path of being separated. Is Publishing a critical asset for a content company? And despite your comments on M&A, historically, you are a different management team now than before, when you bought AOL. So I guess, the way, like I said, you're the only company in terms of the cash position, is that not a competitive advantage?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Yes, it is a competitive advantage, but only if you have to use it well. In terms of the complexion or proposition of Time Warner and to your specific question, is publishing a core business, there are lot things that are attractive about publishing, even if its experiencing a tough ad market right now. And for one thing like our other Time Warner businesses it is branded content business and it can go across multiple platforms like our Networks.", "Time Inc. Publishing has huge scale in its business domestically, and in the places where top rating overseas, it has a very cash flow generation. We think it can grow and leadership is up in a number overall -- in a number of the brands more than others.", "Having said that, there are obviously some questions which are -- is the situation in publishing, magazine publishing specifically cyclical or secular? And how does it compare to what's happened in the present business of the newspapers? We think that's a very different business than newspapers and if you take some of the key differences magazine leadership is growing whereas newspapers were declining.", "And the percentage of Americans that read magazines is twice the number percentage -- 85% versus 48% reading newspaper. And then a very critical set of difference is, magazines are national, not local and they are not relying on classified ads. So that's... those are some of the positive points on print and magazines. Some of the questions of course remain -- it's been a fairly long pressure on the add market. There are pressures on key advertising sectors that have traditionally supported things like the news magazines business. There are clearly differences between magazines that are frequency week, weeklies and biweeklies much healthier than monthlies. Style, fashion and magazine that appeal to women have been much stronger and more prompt to growth and to cross platform success than others.", "So, definitely lot of questions about, how that specific business works overall. But I mean we'll probably be a further shakeout in that industry. And there is lot of things to address and I am not going to go off solely on magazines. But we're very focused with the magazine management on those questions and how to make our Publishing company the most successful amongst its competitive set. And then as assuming that we continue to do that, we then have to determine what is the best financial structure for that business in long run? Back to the rest of Time Warner, which may well include Publishing, but we're not making a religious statement about it either way at this point.", "Clearly, the lead that we have in worldwide film and television production and distribution, and television branded networks, not just on TV, but online it is a significant business opportunity. It's growing around the world, it's growing due to digital. We have advantage position, and it's something we know how to do. So those will be the guiding focus points of Time Warner going forward.", "Doug Shapiro", "With that I think we're few minutes past the hour. I apologize again for the technical delay at the beginning and thanks a lot for listening in.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the call over to Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Doug Shapiro", "This morning, we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the quarter and the other reaffirming our 2009 business outlook. Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover.", "First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on the investor portion of our Web site at timewarner.com/investors. A reconciliation of our expected future financial performance is also included in the business outlook release that's available on our Web site.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Thank you for your attention and now let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "With half a year behind us, I am very pleased with what we've accomplished so far, particularly in light of the obviously difficult economic environment.", "The advertising markets where we operate have been more stable lately, but we aren't seeing major improvements and because advertisers are holding onto budgets longer, our visibility remains lower than usual.", "Home video sell-through also remains pressured by tough retail trends. Against this backdrop, adjusted OIBDA for our content businesses rose 4% in the second quarter and it's up 3% for the first half. In fact, we expect it to grow for the full year, which should prove to be a considerably stronger performance than most of our media competitors.", "As you saw this morning, we are confident that we will achieve our full year outlook. Our performance so far this year reflects both the diversity of our revenue streams and the continuing progress we're making towards our key operating goals. ", "And as we've discussed before, these goals are: first, to leverage our scale and brands to deliver high quality content consistently; second, to keep improving the efficiency of our operations; third, to expand internationally; and fourth, to continue to develop business models that capitalize on changes in the consumer usage and technology.", "Let me give you a few examples of what we achieved this quarter, starting with the success of our content. You all know I've talked before about why hits are growing in value, even as consumption continues to fragment. I've also discussed why our brands and scale enable us to attract talent and consistently make better contact than our competitors, average quarter in and out. In both good and bad times.", "Despite conventional wisdom, we're demonstrating that it is possible to institutionalize success in what is thought to be a hit-driven business. Now, no one can make only hits, but even a slightly better, consistent batting average can clearly yield big advantages over time.", "Take our film and TV production businesses. Two weeks ago Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince set a new worldwide opening record. It generated almost $400.0 million in its first five days. And with this release, Harry Potter has become the most successful franchise in film history, and there are two more installments to go.", "Or consider The Hangover, which just became the highest grossing R-rated comedy ever, replacing another great comedy that was in first place, The Wedding Crashers. So, it's sure to be one of the most profitable films of the year, and with those two films, we have number one and two in the category, proving that we are the funniest of the major media companies.", "Warner Brothers TV is also having a phenomenal year. During the just completed up-front pick up season, we put 26 shows on the network scales, 12 new and 14 returning shows. That, once again, makes Warner's Television the number one provider of network TV programming and that's a spot we've held for 18 of the past 23 years. And we don't own a broadcast network.", "With the success of both our film and TV businesses, Warner is now on pace to grow adjusted OIBDA this year, despite the soft home video environment.", "Now go to the networks. Let's look at Turner, another example of how this virtuous cycle of scale, brands, and talent works. As part of our continuing push to close the gap between our CPMs and those of our broadcast competitors, last year we set the goal of airing original broadcast programming Monday through Wednesday on TNT by 20%. We're achieving that goal a year early with TNT's coming season, with new shows from Jerry Brockheimer, Mark Burnette, Ray Romano, and Jana Pinkett Smith. The level of talent on TNT today would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.", "And the investment in these original series are paying off. In the sixth season The Closer remains the number one original show on ad-supported cable. And our two new originals, Takar[ph] and Dark Blue, are two of the top three new cable shows this year.", "HBO's recent performance also highlights it's synonymous with quality programming. Last month we aired the second season premiere of True Blood. This was the most watched show on HBO since the finale of The Sopranos. Each episode of True Blood now attracts over 11.0 million viewers across linear and on-demand, making it the second most watched show in HBO history.", "But there are many new shows coming on HBO and HBO's new show, Hung, which has already debuted, had a great debut and it retained essentially the entire True Blood audience.", "And ratings for the premiere of Entourage, which is in its sixth season, more than doubled over last year.", "To cap all that off, HBO was just nominated for 99 Emmys. That's the most of any network for the ninth year in a row.", "So even as we continue to invest aggressively in programming and production, we're also working hard to achieve the second goal I mentioned, which is running our businesses more efficiently.", "Despite higher pension and restructuring expenses this year, our operating costs this quarter declined by more than $600.0 million, compared to the same quarter last year. This reflected not only restructurings we undertook last year at corporate and at Time, Inc. but it also reflected the continued tight cost controls in every division.", "This focus on efficiencies is an ongoing way of doing business for us. I think you've seen very steady progress over the last year and a half on that and we are currently seeking additional opportunities across the company and increasing our emphasis on returns, which we look at division by division as well as for the entire company.", "Another of our key priorities is continuing to develop new business models. And we have a long history of capitalizing on changes in technology and consumption, whether it were pay TV, VOD, DVD, and today we are as determined as ever to ensure that new models are additive, not cannibalistic. ", "An important of this is TV Everywhere. For the foreseeable future, we expect that consumers will continue to watch programs mostly on TV. We are all excited about the rise of video on broadband, but as we have seen that dawn of that new business, we have also witnessed continued steady increases in TV watching, TV usage, and subscription levels.", "And our own experience with the success of HBO video-on-demand shows that increasingly consumers want to watch the shows when they want to watch, and they want to be able to select what they watch when, and they want to determine where they want to watch the shows, and on which device.", "TV Everywhere is the right model for consumers. It will allow consumers who subscribe to a television service at home to watch programs whenever they want, on whichever TV or broadband device they want, at no additional charge.", "And at the same time that it's right for consumers, TV Everywhere is right for the industry. It builds on cable programmers successful, dual-revenue stream business model, helping to ensure continued robust investment in high quality programs and allowing every kind of television network, from broad bill to niche, to succeed financially.", "While it is still early, we made some important headway this quarter. We announced an agreement with Comcast that established some principles that we think could be fundamental for TV Everywhere and for all distributors on all networks, to set the stage for a technical trial that's getting underway now. And we're in active discussions with a number of other distributors, cable companies, satellite distributors, and telephone companies, to do the exact same thing.", "The other big news this quarter, as you know, is our announcement that we plan to spin off AOL. That's another big stride in reshaping Time Warner that we started last year. Spinning off AOL will enable us at Time Warner to focus even more on driving the best possible performance from our content businesses, which have always been the core of our company and our capability.", "But it's also the right decision for AOL because it should improve AOL's operational and strategic flexibility and very important, it will make it easier for AOL to attract and retain the best talent. Since the announcement, we have made a lot of progress on this spin off mechanical process.", "Three weeks ago we repurchased Google's 5% stake, which should simplify the spin off process. Earlier this week AOL also filed a registration statement with the SEC, which is a critical step and with that process underway, we are on track to complete the transaction around the end of the year.", "Before you hear from John, I would like to touch on our capital deployment. We approach capital management with three objectives. This is not the first time you've heard me say this. First, to invest fully in our existing businesses, second, to maintain a strong balance sheet, including operating with an appropriate leverage target and with ample liquidity, and third, to allocate our excess financial capacity optimally, whether by returning capital directly to stockholders, or by making appropriate acquisitions.", "I would like to spend a minute on this last objective, allocating our excess financial capacity. We view consistent stock repurchases, along with our regular dividend, as an important part of our capital plan. After we announced our plan at the end of May, to separate AOL, we were able to resume repurchasing the company's stock. As you've seen, we bought back about $350.0 million of our shares over the past two months.", "Acquisitions are another potential use of our excess capacity. As we have discussed before, we look at each deal through a rigorous set of filters, including strategic fit, execution risks, and financial return. And the acquisition needs to provide strategic benefits, whether by improving our scale, our efficiency, our competitive position, or by adding important capabilities to our existing businesses that we need.", "In addition, any acquisition needs to provide an attractive risk adjusted return as compared to other uses of our capital, which include buying back our own stock.", "I would like to close by telling you why I'm so excited about the future of Time Warner as a pure content company. I think we have a sustained competitive advantage and a track record creating and monetizing high-quality content. Our track record of successful innovation in new business models positions us to benefit as technology and consumption methods change by consumers. And we're focused on efficiency and prudent allocation of capital, including direct returns to shareholders. ", "Thanks again for your interest and now I would like to turn the call over to John.", "John K. Martin", "I'm going to just briefly go through our second quarter results and there are slides that are now available on our Web site to help you follow along with my remarks, so jumping into it, beginning on the first slide, I'll begin by making a few high-level observations or take-aways.", "You know, heading into the year, we aim to deliver financial performance at the top end of our peers, tightly control costs, and meet the objectives of our capital plan, as Jeff just explained. And now that we're half way through the year, I think we're well on our way to achieving all of these goals.", "The content group suggested OIBDA was up 4% in the quarter, and that's despite a tough revenue environment. That was a little better than we expected heading into the quarter, and while some of this outperformance was due to timing, much of it was due to better business performance as well as continuing cost efforts.", "This morning we reaffirmed our outlook for flat adjusted EPS for the year and we feel increasingly confident that we'll achieve that. ", "From a capital standpoint, we continued to generate significant free cash flow in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis we have a 59% conversion ratio of adjusted OIBDA. And this has allowed us to increase returns to shareholders while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and after announcing at the end of May the plans to separate AOL, as Jeff just said, we reentered the market, bought back nearly $350.0 million of stock in just two months. And as Jeff explained, we really do view this as an important ongoing part of our capital plan.", "The next slide shows our consolidated second quarter financial highlights and just a couple of things to point out here. Revenues declined 9% year-over-year, which reflects double-digit year-over-year decreases in both advertising and content revenues, as well as a modest decline in subscription revenues.", "Keep in mind, however, that about half of the overall revenue decline was due to difficult foreign currency translation comparisons as well as continuing decline in AOL subscription revenues.", "Total adjusted OIBDA declined 2% despite an almost 700 basis point drag related to pension, FX, and restructuring charges, and as I just mentioned, the content group's adjusted OIBDA was up 4% in the quarter and has posted 3% growth in the first half of the year.", "Margins were up 200 basis points in the quarter as foreign currency on costs continues to pay off and we managed to lower our operating expenses, which include both cost of revenues as well as SG&A by more than $600.0 million compared to the second quarter of last year, with costs being lower in virtually every division and margins were flat or better at every division with the exception of publishing.", "Lastly, adjusted EPS was $0.45 and we've now generated $0.90 year-to-date. ", "So continuing on and just looking briefly at each of our divisions, I'll begin with networks. And here we saw adjusted OIBDA up a very, very strong 14% in the quarter. With expenses relative flat, solid revenue growth drove significant margin expansion here and the networks division represented over 70% of our content groups profits in the quarter.", "Subscription revenues grew 8% and that reflected higher affiliate fees at both turner and HBO. The consolidation of HBO Latin America also contributed here while unfavorable FX was a drag.", "Advertising revenues were down 3% and that's a little better than we expected coming into the quarter, and while our domestic entertainment networks actually grew advertising low single digits in the quarter, the decline was principally due to softness at Turners International networks, which were down due to lower demand and unfavorable FX.", "Advertising also declined at our domestic news networks and that's partly due to the difficult comparison against the U.S. presidential election coverage last year.", "In addition to the network's revenue growth, adjusted OIBDA benefitted from lower news gathering costs as well as the consolidation of HBO Latin America.", "Programming expenses increased modestly during the quarter as higher original programming expenses were offset by lower NBA costs. And keep in mind that relative to what we were originally planning, we have about $20.0 million of OIBDA in the quarter that reflected favorable timing of certain expenses, including marketing, which we expect will likely reverse in the second half of the year.", "In terms of the advertising environment, scatter pricing is about flat to up front levels and business continues to be booked very close to air date. ", "Heading into the third quarter, Turners advertising trends look relatively similar to the second quarter, with the exception that our domestic news comparisons will get meaningfully more difficult as the year progresses. And I just wanted to put that in some perspective. Last year in the third quarter domestic news revenue grew 19% and it grew 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. One more comment on advertising. In addition, we are seeing some softness in the kids market.", "While focus on our costs will continue this year, we don't expect to experience the same degree of margin expansion in the second half of the year as we saw in the first. This is by design, as we will continue to increase investment in our original content. And based on the timing of our slate of original programming, we anticipate higher growth in programming expenses in the back half of the year.", "Turning to film, Warner Brothers posted another quarter of adjusted OIBDA growth, and this growth was driven by the phenomenal performance of our film [inaudible]. It was also driven by lower P&A and lower overhead as a result of our ongoing cost initiatives.", "It also reflected a roughly $40.0 million benefit from the reversal of certain home video returns reserves and that's due to better than expected catalogue performance over the past several quarters. ", "Revenue was down year-over-year primarily due to tough home video comparisons, general softness in the home video trends, as well as unfavorable FX. We had five key home video releases in the second quarter led by Grand Torino, Yes Man, and He's Just Not That Into You, and that compared to ten titles in last year's second quarter.", "Comparisons were also challenging in our video games business due to last year's release of the very successful Lego Indiana Jones.", "Looking ahead for the rest of the year, in our film group, despite the record breaking opening of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, we expect second half results to be more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter than in most years, versus the third quarter. In fact, the third quarter will likely be down year-over-year. And again, that's just timing. It doesn't reflect business fundamentals per se.", "The third quarter is going to be affected by tough comparisons against our theatrical slate and video game releases in the third quarter of last year, as well as higher television production spending tied to new shows for the upcoming season.", "In addition, our successful summer films, including Harry Potter, The Hangover, and Terminator Salvation will all be released on home video in the fourth quarter.", "Moving on to publishing, second quarter ad revenues were very soft, down 26% over the prior-year quarter. That's consistent with what we indicated it would be on last earnings call and it actually improved slightly from the first quarter.", "The year-over-year decreases were driven by the continued decline in print advertising as well as unfavorable FX.", "Subscription revenues also showed continued softness. Over 40% of this year-over-year decline was driven by unfavorable FX but domestic newsstand sales and renewals were also down. It's worth noting that we have seen an uptick in subscription renewals in recent weeks and that's back to pre-credit crisis levels so that's somewhat encouraging.", "We've reduced operating expenses here 15% in the quarter but this was more than offset by the revenue decrease resulting in meaningful year-over-year OIBDA declines.", "Looking ahead, visibility still remains limited here but we have seen some signs of stabilization in advertising. Moreover, with easier comparisons in the second half of the year, we do fully expect to see improvements in both revenue and OIBDA trends in the second half.", "Moving to AOL, and I'll begin by focusing on their advertising results, the dynamics this quarter were very similar to what we saw in the first quarter and were in line with what we had expected. Advertising revenues continued to experience pressure across display, page search, and the third-party network, falling 21% in the quarter.", "AOL media, which includes both display and page search, declined 19%. Display was down in line with our overall advertising revenues due to continued pricing pressure as a larger proportion of inventory was purchased through lower priced sales channels compared to a year ago.", "And page search revenues from Google decreased 17% due primarily to lower query volumes and lower click-through rates on the AOL client.", "Additionally, cost-per-click continues to be adversely affected by algorithmic changes made by Google, and we've talked about that in the past.", "Third-party network revenues declined as higher pricing was more than offset by lower demand.", "Looking ahead for the rest of the year, we are not yet seeing signs of a recovery in demand at this division and therefore we expect similar pressure on advertising revenue relative to what we saw in the first half.", "Shifting quickly to the rest of AOL's results, subscription revenues continued to decline as AOL lost about 0.5 million subscribers in the second quarter. This is a slight improvement from the first quarter and is the lowest quarterly subscriber loss since the start of the transition to a free service back in 2006.", "OIBDA declined in the quarter due to lower revenues and management continues to actively manage the cost base here in the face of revenue declines and therefore were able to keep margins flat.", "Through the first half AOL incurred $73.0 million of restructuring costs, including $15.0 million in Q2.", "The next slide highlights that corporate expenses once again declined year-over-year as the cost savings efforts that we put in place last year continue to have a positive impact. And we clearly remain committed to managing corporate costs and we continue to look for additional efficiencies.", "Turning to our outlook on the next slide, as both Jeff and I mentioned, we are reaffirming the full year outlook and while the environment remains challenging, clearly our first half performance increases our confidence that we will achieve our goals here of around flat adjusted EPS in 2009 compared to 2008.", "Going into this year, frankly, at the beginning of the year we knew that the second and third quarters would be our toughest from a year-over-year growth perspective and while we expected that the second quarter would wind up being almost challenging, due to the strong performance of our releases at Warners, a more stable advertising environment at our networks, and the timing of certain revenue and expenses, it was clearly better than what we had expected and therefore we now expect that the third quarter will exhibit the most challenging year-over-year trends and again I would just reiterate, that that's a matter of timing and not a change in business fundamentals.", "We continue to expect the strongest OIBDA growth quarter of the year quarter to come in the fourth quarter and that's in part due to easy comparisons against some pretty big charges that we incurred in the fourth quarter of last year. It also reflects our expectations of easy FX comparisons as well as the strength of our home video release slate.", "Let me turn to free cash flow. Next slide. Our cash generation remains robust and in the first half of the year we've generated about $1.8 billion of free cash, which is a 60% conversion ratio. This highlights both the relatively low capital intensity of our businesses as well as a continuing focus on working capital management.", "Relative to last year, our conversion ratio was pretty comparable as we offset higher taxes with lower interest expense. And as you know there is significant seasonality in the timing of tax and interest payments as well as working capital which causes conversion rates to vary over the course of the year. And consistent with our usual pattern, we expect the conversion ratio to be lower in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year.", "Moving forward, looking at our capital structure and capital deployment initiatives, we ended the second quarter with about $10.5 billion in net debt. That's up slightly compared to last quarter but down more than $10.0 billion since year end. And balance sheet changes during the second quarter reflected returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as well as our investment in CME. And this was offset by continued free cash flow generation.", "Our leverage ratio is now about 1.6x based on the last 12 months of adjusted OIBDA and as you think about the rest of the year, there are at least five things that could somewhat impact our balance sheet.", "First, we fully expect to continue to generate strong levels of free cash. Second, we will pay Google $283.0 million for their 5% stake in AOL. Third, we will likely use $2.0 billion of cash on hand to satisfy some debt maturing prior to year end. And this won't change net debt in total but it will serve to reduce our cash balances. Fourth, we will return capital to shareholders through our committed dividend and we still have an existing share repurchase authorization. And fifth, we intend to spin AOL.", "So with one caveat being that we haven't yet decided how AOL will be capitalized, the net-net of all the items I just mentioned will be that our leverage ratio and our net debt balance will likely move a little higher in the near term.", "We fully expect, however, that we will continue to maintain attractive capacity and attractive flexibility against our stated long-term leverage targets.", "So that's the quick review of the quarter. Thanks everybody for listening in, and now we'll be happy to answer to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse", "Jeff, it seems like the upfront is pretty close to getting wrapped up at this point, so I was wondering if you could talk about the results for Turner in terms of CPM pricing and inventory sell out.", "And John, can you talk a little about how you plan on balancing share buybacks with the dividend and if boosting the dividend is something you're contemplating.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "On the Turner up front, it's not quite over so I'll just give you general view how it's shaping up. We think we'll take share from the broadcast networks, basically due to the scale of all of our brands, led by TBS TNT. And the huge reach of TBS TNT as a replacement devices for the big four broadcast networks.", "And so consistent with the business booking closer to air time and air date and scatter, it looks as though the overall dollars going into the upfront will be down a bit as clients look for flexibility.", "We do think that they will come back in scatter and we are seeing in the discussions the clients are quite aware that they'll have to pay for this flexibility of moving a little bit of their purchasing from upfront to scatter.", "All of this though, we think Turner and our networks are going to be at the top of the heap on total revenue performance but we do think that it could make the upfront a little less of an indicator for the health of the ad market than it usually is.", "So I think you will all have to look carefully at how much of the advertiser spending budgets are actually going into the upfront and then take a look at that in relation to both pricing trends and what networks do in their upfront sales price and how much volume goes where.", "John K. Martin", "I think it's fair to say that providing a direct return to shareholders is an important component of our capital allocation plan and our capital deployment plan. And we're pleased that we're in a year where we actually can strengthen our balance sheet, increase investment in our businesses, as well as increase returns to shareholders directly. ", "And oftentimes those three are in conflict but we're in a year that's pretty unique and we can do all three.", "As we sit here today, we think steady return to shareholders through a mix of dividends and share buybacks is preferable and we are taking somewhat of a measured approach to our capital deployment, which we think is prudent in light of the economic environment.", "The only other thing I would add is we already have a meaningful dividend today of about $900.0 million annually. It's a meaningful yield. Having said that, we're always going to revisit the level over time and we're hopeful that the dividend can grow in line with our business growth going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank Securities", "John, a clarification. Is the softness you are seeing in the kids marketplace related to share losses or a soft kids marketplace overall?", "And Jeff, I'm wondering if I can narrow you a little bit on the upfront. I think you were talking about dollar share when you said Turner would take upfront share. Is that going to be the same for price? We're seeing networks pricing down 3% to down 8% in the CPMs. Is that consistent with what you're seeing? Should we expect Turner to be at the end of that range or above that range, since you're usually a leader in rate increases?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We will be toward the higher end of the range. As you know, that's a bit of a decision on how you want to handle your amount in upfront. [inaudible] scatter. I can't give you the precise answer of exactly what we're going to do but we think some of our decisions will put at the high end on price.", "John K. Martin", "You're clarification question, I was really referring to more of a comment on the soft kids marketplace in general and not intending to reflect share losses in any way whatsoever. We do think Cartoon network is well positioned. Recently ratings have been growing. But it's not doubt a challenging year for the kids market due to weakness in toys as well as cut backs in food and beverage. ", "And as a result one of the things that the management team is trying to do at Cartoon network is address this by aging up the audience somewhat and there's been a change in strategy there that's underway. And we're hoping over time that that's going to help open up new advertising categories that thus far we don't participate in.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I would like to add to that. On that channel [inaudible] and that's quite strong in ratings and ad performance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen - BAS-ML.", "Jessica Reif-Cohen - BAS-ML", "Jeff, you mentioned at the beginning of the call that one of the corporate goals is to expand internationally. I was wondering if you could elaborate on is the strategy to build or would you have to continue to buy? CME is pretty small but if you could elaborate on that it would be helpful.", "And then for John, on the cost side, you've managed your costs down incredibly well. What's your expectation as revenue comes back? Can you keep costs at these levels or do you think you'll have to increase some spending?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We don't have any specific goals that we can articulate publicly here. We just think that international markets, and you can't look at the whole world and identify which ones, have some long term sector with trends of potentially higher growth than the developed world, which is quite attractive for a big global media company. ", "And if you look at Time Warner, we have about 27% of our revenue coming from international markets. That's higher, as a percentage, than I think all of our competitors except News Corp. ", "And when you look at that you have to look at what sector are you in? Are you in movies and television, are you in newspapers? What makes up your international? We think we're in very good sectors in development networks and as we look at certain international markets that we think have long-term growth, particularly Eastern Europe, South America, Latin America, India, and as we look at sectors of the developed countries that particularly local channel television networks and production that we think have good long-term growth, those are just of interest to us.", "Now to your question of whether you buy them or build them, we do have a very good worldwide position of strength, both in film and TV sales of American export product and of international TV networks. And you've seen us expand that at HBO, which is number one wherever it operates in the world. Like in ownership positions at HBO, you've seen us expand by in certain cases in Latin America and Eastern Europe, buying other broad leading network positions in order to distribute and program them adjacently with our American networks.", "So we really look at those in a fairly long-term strategic sense and we will both build and acquire so long as in the case of acquiring that it fits the criteria that we discussed when I was going through our return and what we need in terms of returns to make investments.", "And so that's essentially our plan for international.", "John K. Martin", "On the cost side, and I appreciate the comment, I do think we've done a pretty good job sort of across the board, really improving the efficiency of our operations. It's not in any way meant to suggest that we're doing austerity cost cutting. Because a lot of what's happening is based on designs that have been put in place for at least a year or so.", "Having said that, I think that we're going to constantly look for more and more opportunities. It's an ongoing way of operating for us and just one example, no formal restructurings have been announced at Turner yet. They're on track to reduce SG&A by over $50.0 million this year. And it's just the way that we need to continue to operate to address Jeff's focus on returns. And we're looking to free up resources in capital and put it to work in more productive and more useful ways.", "And so I do believe, and we do believe, that there is margin expansion possibilities in every one of our divisions going forward. And quarter in and quarter out it can bounce around but longer term that's going to be the goal and I think we've got a good shot at achieving it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "I wonder if you could differentiate for us, if you look at your margin expansion in networks year-to-date, what's been the expansion trends between HBO and Turner? Are they expanding at similar rates? Or can you give some background, which businesses are showing the better margin expansion this year?", "John K. Martin", "In terms of the margin expansion year-to-date, we have seen margins expand at each of the areas and I'm not going to go into great detail differentiating the two. I think Turner, over the near term, has expanded more and there have been specific things that we highlighted, which is that there was lower news gathering at CNN, lower NBA programming amortization, and lower marketing at Turner. And that's been the thrust year-to-date. And as I said, that's going to change a little bit in the back half of the year, although I do think for the full year will be improved margins at Turner.", "And at HBO, they've been on a consistent long-term architecture to improve margins year in and year out. And really this year should be no different and this year year-to-date I would say one of the big contributors, in addition to cost containment, has been increased content profit at HBO.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Jeff, you have a really strong TV business, as you've talked about, in terms of syndication. But I wondered are there any concerns you have looking at the state of the local station business system, the bankruptcies you've seen, whether or not this business can keep growing in light of kind of the difficulties that some of your end users are having.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I can understand the question. I think the local TV broadcasting groups, there are some of them that have gone bankrupt, and there are some that will.", "Having said that, we're not particularly concerned about it. It's not a terribly large part of our business. About less than 10% of our television series sales comes from off [inaudible] syndication. It's really less than 5% of the revenue in the whole film segment.", "And even if you look at that, about 60% of it is from stage and 40% comes from cable, which isn't a question and it's not in your question. So you're looking really, if you had pretty severe problem on the local stations buying syndicated product, you're looking at in effect, it could be 1% or 2% in revenue. And that is not hard to move around to other buyers.", "So we don't see a particular problem in the kind of ongoing profitability or growth of profit. You could always in a given quarter, let's say this year, see some people going bankrupt and off revenue adjust a little but it would be material.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Greenfield - Pali Research.", "Richard Greenfield - Pali Research", "You've been cutting down for the last 18 months the size and scope of our film business. Are there any areas or genres of the business that you would actually be interested in expanding into which you don't have a presence in today, given the strength of your balance sheet.", "And Sony did a deal with Red Box last week. I was wondering how you think about Red Box, working with them, not working with them and the impact on your overall film business.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "On the scope of the film business and which segments are we in, since Warners is the largest studio, we don't need to expand into any additional genre. ", "Having said that, if we saw opportunities to build or acquire new capabilities at the right return, we would look at it. There are several kind of usual suspects that float around in that category. But we always look at the benchmarks that I described in my big remarks.", "Sony on Red Box. Sony did a deal with Red Box last week. We can't really comment on specific deals or deals that other do. We weren't in that deal obviously. In general, we think that there may well be a role for $1 rental kiosks or pricing in that range. Just like there are $1 movie theaters. We think it's a question of the right window. So we think it can be additive. And to the extent it's competitive, we're not unduly concerned about it.", "Richard Greenfield - Pali Research", "But you would like to see a window before Red Box titles come out versus the current day and date that they're making them available at?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Probably.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Jeff, just taking that home video question out sort of bigger picture, there's been a lot of commentary about DVD sales being weak this year. I think your view is it's mostly related to the cycle or in retail pressure. But rental has been growing nicely. Probably Red Box but also Netflix. Video-on-demand has been growing although it's been a little tepid recently. How do you look at these changes in consumer behavior, sell-through versus rental? Do you think this is business model change that you can exploit and want to address from a windowing perspective, pricing perspective, across all these platforms, or is this purely just sort of bumps in the road as the economy move around?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "There are a lot of pieces to that. It's important to look at the whole category. Physical DVD, Blu-Ray high def, electronic sell-through, rental, etc. And if you start with the total picture of consumer activity, because they don't care how they see the movie, they want to watch it through one of those elements I just talked about.", "Consumer spending is improving. It's down only 4% this quarter, which is quite a bit better than the 7% drop in the fourth quarter or the 5% drop in the first quarter. Those are aggregated numbers, so if you look at the best titles, they're still performing well. And the continued shift to digital has positive margin implications, which I think was in your question, because a number of these new electronic and digital delivery systems have high margins.", "Having said that, we are seeing some shift to rentals and we're monitoring it closely. But basically, and I think you had it as a premise in your question, the digital margin and profitability of the new forms versus the old physical forms, whether it's in sell-through or rental, they're more profitable in digital.", "So as this all moves to digital and as we try to lead and speed that along, it actually means more convenience, better pricing at retail and higher margins. So it's good for the business overall. The question is okay, that's all good but if in the midst of all that some of the activity moves more to rental than sell-through, rentals being essentially a bit less of a purchase transaction than sell-through, does that affect at the end of the day the net contribution to film product?", "I doubt that will happen. We've been there before and we saw rental as the chief means of everybody watching films back in the days of Blockbuster VHS rentals and yet again it moved to sell-through because it was more convenient for people to keep it and have it when they want and so forth. So I think it's early to say that we should be overly concerned about rental versus sell-through in terms of what it does to overall profitability.", "But we've got a fair amount of flexibility on how to price these and make them available. And I think that our long-term view is that it's actually a set of positive developments and should make the business healthier.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "And John, on the publishing, your opex fall in has been pacing down, sort of low teens first half of the year. Is that something that you think continues in the back half or is there a sizeable variable component? I know there is a currency element, too, so that should moderate a bit.", "John K. Martin", "I think generally speaking, it should continue, you're going to start lapping some of the cost savings that they achieved in the back part of last year, although we think that could be somewhat mitigated by easing FX comparisons.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Morris \u2013 UBS.", "Michael Morris - UBS", "Jeff, you mentioned at the beginning of your comments that ads were more stable. Can you share with us a bit of what you've seen on a category basis in terms of trends over the last quarter. Which categories have maybe firmed up a bit and contributed to that stability?", "And John, with respect to your guidance, I can't help but think it looks a bit conservative given the second quarter. It sounds like second quarter is a bit of a surprise for you relative to where to were when you set the guidance and your comments for the balance of the year were cautiously optimistic. So in the decision to leave the guidance unchanged, have you taken things down in the second half in your expectations or is it just general conservatism?", "John K. Martin", "I will take the second one first. Look, just to go back and briefly reiterate what both Jeff and I were saying on our proactive remarks. The second quarter did end up being better than what we had expected coming into the quarter. And some of that was timing, some of it was just better business performance. And we are pleased against what is a tough economic backdrop. We're very pleased with the performance that our businesses have shown on a year-to-date basis through June.", "And I'm reminded of the fact that even if we achieve our guidance of essentially flat or flat adjusted EPS it's going to set us apart from virtually all of our peers and competitors this year, who are experiencing meaningful year-over-year declines.", "Looking at the back half of the year, we are cautiously optimistic but we are sensitive to the fact that we are continuing to operate in a tough and challenging environment that is somewhat limiting our visibility.", "There are certain things that we, ourselves, are going to do in terms of actively managing investment levels in our businesses and we'll do that opportunistically where we think we can improve our business positioning and extend our competitive position. ", "So with that all wrapped up together, we'll continue to monitor how the operations pace for the rest of the year, but we feel really good about how we performed and we feel good about expectations for the rest of this year.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "If your question was on which advertising categories are stabilizing and which ones are weaker, let's go through networks then publishing then AOL. I met networks at Turner, the best performing categories are quick service restaurants and wireless teleco and movies. The weakness areas for TV cable network ads are auto, financial, and food and beverage.", "In the publishing company, basically the resilient areas are food and beverage, media, movies, tech, and telecom. The weaker areas are fashion, retail, financial, and jewelry.", "At AOL the resilient categories are health and marketing services, telecom and travel and the weaker sections are auto, financial, and retail.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony Diclemente - Barclays Capital.", "Anthony Diclemente - Barclays Capital", "On those categories I think you're referring to Q2 but I'm curious as to whether you've seen any recent uptick in automotive spend activity in association with the government's Cash for Clunker rebate program.", "My second question is for you Jeff. I'm wondering if you would ever, or how strongly you would ever consider doing a subscription video on demand deal with another distributor, like Netflix or Apple, for new release cable TV content. I know that would be outside of a kind of a TV Everywhere test and deal that you're doing with Comcast, but assuming that another third-party aggregator could offer you a good price for that content and then window it in an intelligent way, is that ever something that you would consider doing?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Are you saying when you ask that whether we would sell movies to it or are you saying that [inaudible] would take it over?", "Anthony Diclemente - Barclays Capital", "I'm more referring to the cable TV, I guess what I'm getting at is are we ever going to evolve to a point where your TV content, I guess I'm thinking more about Turner, are we going to get to a point where your TV content is truly available everywhere? And truly available in places outside of just the owned and operated cable sites like Sancast.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "First of all, the answer is yes, like tomorrow. Maybe it's not understood what TV Everywhere is. It would mean that you could go watch any cable network you wanted on any device you wanted, on VOD in your house or on broadband. Using any broadband connection you want. You don't have to go to any cable distributor's Web site. You want to go to TNT.tv or CNN, you could go there because you can do it. You won't have to pay anything. You don't need a subscription model, you've already got one which is already paid\u201492% of Americans are already paying for it. They've already got all these networks.", "That's why we're saying it's so powerful. And it will bring the advertising right along with it in that it multi-platforms sales should have the premium aspect to it because you'll be selling ads across TNT on tv, TNT on broadband, TNT on VOD, using any broadband connection. So please don't think of it as restricted to the Web site of any video distributor.", "That will be one place to get it if you want to go there because it will be easy. It'll also be easy to go to CNN.com, which by the way, if you go there today, it's the number one site for TV electronic or broadband news across the world.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alan Gould - Natixis Bleichroeder.", "Alan Gould - Natixis Bleichroeder ", "In the past you said Turner CPMs are about two-thirds of broadcast. Given these recent results and what you see in the upfront, do you think that number is going to be significantly increasing this year, or has been increasing?", "And John, can you just remind us the economics, when I look at Harry Potter versus Dark Night, I believe you own 100% of Harry Potter and owned 50% of Dark Night. Will Harry Potter this year be more profitable than Dark Night was last year?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Let me start with the long term outlook. As the cable, as the multi-channel networks like TNT, TBS, USA, the ones with big reach and high quality programs, as those continue to have viewers go there and watch longer broadcasts, the fact that you can buy the same eyeballs for two-thirds the cost on cable is going to bring some volumes in the long run to those either [inaudible] or the sell out and the volume.", "In the long run, not just looking at this quarter in the middle of a recession, any network, and we've got several of them, that has scale retrading from quality programs with a good environment of good shows, is going to continually be able to increase the attractiveness of its sales, and therefore raise pricing and it's volume of sales.", "So over time, the CPM gap should and will close. And basically you've seen that steadily. There has been a prospect. It hasn't closed as fast as any of us have expected. If you just look at it quantitatively. But these things do get to tipping points where things start to move faster and I think that will happen in the near future. Not this year but in the near future.", "John K. Martin", "Regarding your question Dark Night versus Harry Potter, we don't provide any particular detail or guidance on a title by title basis. I think generally speaking, any film is going to be a tough comp to the Dark Night, which as you know, is the number two film domestically of all time and the number four film internationally. ", "But you're right in that the Dark Night was a shared relationship with Legendary whereas Harry Potter is wholly-owned. So in those types of situations you would rather have the wholly-owned for those wildly profitable films. I would just leave it at that.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citigroup.", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup", "Do you think that TV Everywhere, the efficacy of that strategy is dependent on other content owners setting up a similar business model or do you think you can go solo and still have it be quite viable?", "On the financial side, at the very end of John's comments he mentioned the capitalization of AOL is still being determined. My question is, has a final decision been made regarding whether or not the dial up business will be part of that spend.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We don't think there's any need for us to wait for other programmers, network, content, operators, in order to make our decision and establish what we think is the direction. We do think that most other programmers will come to the same conclusion that we have and we think from discussions with our distributors, cable, telephone, and satellite and even wireless, that all of them are coming to that conclusion. So we think it's a very powerful and actually pretty obvious natural evolution of what will happen and what consumers will easily embrace. ", "And it's essentially because it is so convenient for consumers and it gives them basically the networks they clearly love which are gaining in popularity and usage and makes them more useable. And we've seen it. We've seen in on HBO. It's a proven trial. You put VOD capability onto a network and you increase its attractiveness and the ease of its use for consumers. And we want you to always focus not just on the broadband infrastructure, which is part of this, but also the VOD infrastructure that connects to your television set. All of it can go together and make it easier for consumers to watch whatever network, whatever show they want and not worry about is on and not having to worry about paying for it.", "John K. Martin", "And the answer to your second question is a very quick answer. Yes, the dial up subscription access business is in.", "Doug Shapiro", "That will wrap it up and thanks for joining us.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

(NYSE:TWX) Q3 2009 Earnings Call November  4, 2009 10:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Doug Shapiro \u2013 Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Jeffrey L.

(Operator instructions.)  I will now turn the call over to Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "Doug Shapiro", "This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the quarter, the other updating our 2009 business outlook.  Before we begin, there are two items I need to talk about.  Results refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP measures to the most direct and comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules.  ", "These schedules are available at our Website at timewarner.com/investors.  Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release available on site.  Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations.  ", "Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied through these statements due to various factors.  These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings.  Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  With that, I will turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "As you read this morning, we have good news for you today.  We are executing very well in spite of the tough environment.  We're raising our guidance and we're on track to complete the AOL spin this year.  We're making a lot of progress toward our longer term strategic priorities.  So I'm increasingly confident that we are well positioned to deliver steady, attractive stockholder returns in 2010 and beyond that.  Our third quarter results were better than expected.  ", "In spite of the advertising climate and difficult comparisons in film and networks versus last year's high performance, adjusted OIBDA for our content groups held flat in the quarter and is now about 2% year-to-date.  This strong performance was broad-based, coming from HBO, Turner and Warner Brothers.  ", "As you saw this morning in our business outlook these results gave us the confidence to raise our full-year outlook for 2009.  We now expect adjusted earnings per share of at least $2.05.  This even includes as much as $100 million or about $0.05 per share in new restructuring charges at Time Inc. that we announced today.  I'll tell you more about that in a minute.", "For the first time we've also provided an outlook for just our Content Group, adjusted earnings per share of at least $1.75.  That's up around 25% on a reported basis versus last year and it's at least a mid-single digits increase, if you take out a big legal reserve we had at the end of last year.", "We provided guidance this way because we are confident that we will complete the AOL spin this year.  This separation is an important milestone for both companies.  It will enable both AOL and Time Warner to focus even more on our core business moving each of us toward our ultimate goal of improving our return on capital.", "Looking forward, we'll stay focused on increasing returns in two ways, growing our profits and allocating our capital for the best risk-adjusted returns.  To boost profit growth, we're focused on the key operating priorities that I talked about before.", "First, continue to leverage our scale, our brands to deliver high-quality content consistently; second, to keep improving efficiency of our operations; third, expand internationally, and, fourth, continue to drive the development of business models to capitalize on changes in consumer usage and technology.", "We're making progress on each of these objectives every quarter.  Let me start with our great content.  I've talked before about our firm belief that hits are growing in value, even as consumption keeps [inaudible].  I've also told you that we think it is possible to institutionalize success in a hit driven business.  We do that by capitalizing on a virtual cycle of scale, distribution, brands and creative and managerial talent.", "One of the best examples is Warner Brothers who's consistency and return profile may not be fully appreciated may not be fully appreciated.  Warner is having another fantastic year.  It is currently ranked number one at the box office.  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the Hangover are two of the four highest grossing films domestically in 2009.", "Even recent releases like Where the Wild Things Are, Final Destination and The Informant have all exceeded expectations and we're very excited about upcoming films, particularly Sherlock Holmes and Clint Eastwood's In Vegas coming out before the end of the year.", "Now although we're releasing fewer movies this year, we're on track to match or exceed last year's domestic box office gross of almost $1.9 trillion.  Our TV production business has also had a great year with 12 new shows ordered by the networks and 14 returning shows.  That makes us the leading provider of broadcast TV programming this season.", "Two and a Half Men and Big Bang Theory are now in the top two comedies on the networks' schedules and in light of the scarcity of comedies they are two of the most valuable shows on television.  These results aren't just grid-lock.  This year will mark the eighth time in the last nine years that our studios have led the domestic box office.", "We've had the number one share of the home video business every one of those nine years and, worldwide, we've produced 8 of the top 15 grossing films ever, while no other studio has produced more than two.", "And we have more of the top running franchises than anybody.  In TV this year we'll mark the 18th time out of the past 23 years that we've been the top producer of broadcast network programming and all this without owning a major broadcast network.", "Sometimes this track record is overlooked because there's a perception that film is inherently the lower term or volatile business.  That's certainly not true and hasn't been true for Warner Brothers.  I can tell you that Warner Brothers' return is well above its costs in capital, excluding the asset write-off sides of the AOL Time Warner merger.", "Just as a glimpse, Warner's level of profit consistently surpasses its peers by far.  This year will mark the ninth straight year it has generated in excess of $1 billion in annual adjusted OIBDA with a very high cash flow from [inaudible].", "In fact despite the softness in home video overall this year, Warner's on pace to report its highest profits ever this year.  Based on the unparalleled track record of our studio under Barry Meyer and Alan Horn, we have every expectation that Warner will continue to lead the industry in the next years coming up.", "The second priority I mentioned is improving the efficiency of our business.  As you know, that's been a focus of ours since I took over as CEO last year.  Many companies have reduced costs during the down time raising questions about how fast expenses will grow as the economy rebounds.", "We set out to reduce our expenses structurally before the economy faltered, so we intend to keep our fixed cost base down even when the economy improves.  We're continually looking for opportunities to make ourselves more efficient.", "As I mentioned a few moments ago, we expect to incur as much as $100 million in restructuring charges at Time Inc. in the fourth quarter.  Last year we undertook a broad-based reorganization at Time Inc. to centralize our domestic magazines into three clusters.", "The restructuring we're announcing today is much more targeted, most of it occurring in our news group.  We believe that much of the downturn in magazine ad revenue has been cyclical.  Readership is still strong.  In the United States, 85% of adults read magazines.  That's unchanged over the past decade.", "In fact, readership in the 18 to 34 demo is actually growing.  Magazines still offer advertisers unparalleled reach and relevance.  Every week more consumers read People than watch the American Idol finality and more people read Sports Illustrated than watch the World Series.", "At the same time, however, consumers are changing the way they access news, sports and business information.  They want immediacy, but our research shows they also face increasing value on the depth of analysis, so besides reducing costs there are a number of things we're trying to achieve through this restructuring.", "We're aiming to increase consumer utility and at the same time the financial sustainability of some of our key brands.  For instance we're reducing the frequency of Fortune Magazine, while investing more in the quality of each issue and focusing our reporting even more on the largest and most important companies.  We'll also promote much greater sharing of editorial and management resources across the newsroom and that will both improve efficiency and enable a more fluid allocation of resources to the biggest and most topical issues.", "And as we have done, we'll continue to take a hard look at non-strategic and less profitable types.  We expect the restructuring will pay for itself in expense savings starting next year.  I would also like to touch on the last priority I listed, developing new business models that capitalize on changes in technology and consumption.  ", "I think that one our most important jobs is to make sure, wherever possible, that new business models are additive and not cannibalistic.  One example is our support of TV Everywhere, which is progressing really quite rapidly.  We have several trials underway with major distributors and several more pending with commercial launches expected soon.  ", "Many other programmers have also signed distribution agreements and many are involved in all of these tests.  All of us are working with several third parties to develop open authentication systems that could be used by any distributor and by any program.", "We've always made tremendous progress toward a single sign-on for consumers that would enable consumers to move between multiple unaffiliated Web sites without reregistering, making TV Everywhere a completely seamless user experience.  An analogous example is the way we're approaching e-readers in the publishing business where we've also been working hard to help flush these [out of the bottle].  ", "We view the emergence of e-readers as a critical opportunity for magazines to migrate their dual revenue stream models to a digital environment.  There's no question about consumer willingness to buy quality content on their IPod or on their Kindle.  ", "With the coming wave of new devices with new features, we think that will only increase.  On the advertising side, a large screen color device with new functionality including support for video would provide an even richer consumer experience and a compelling advertising [device].", "At the top of the call I talked about two ways that we intend to drive returns, profit growth and capital allocation.  Before I turn it over to John I'll remind you of how we think about our capital.  Our first priority is always to make sure that we've taken advantage from all internal investment opportunities, which usually offers us the best returns.  ", "We already do that to date, but we still generate significant free-cash flow.  And after that we look to allocate our excess capacity towards turning capital to shareholders - and where appropriate through acquisitions.  As you know we currently pay a meaningful dividend.  ", "We intend to maintain this same dividend after the AOL separation and we would like to grow it over time in line with underlying business trends.  I also view a steady consistent stock buyback as an important compliment to the dividend.  As you saw this morning, since we resumed our buyback in May we repurchased almost $1 billion worth of stock.  ", "We will also continue to evaluate potential acquisitions against the three hurdles we discussed before.  First, strategic value, second, execution risk, and third, any deal must offer an appropriate risk adjust return relative to alternative pieces of capital including buying back our stock.  At Time Warner we know that capital allocation decisions are just as important as operating performance and driving returns.  ", "We take this responsibility very seriously.  Our goal is to consistently produce earnings per share growth that exceeds our operating income growth, which should in turn exceed our revenue growth.  That will require both strong operating performance and careful stewardship of the balance sheet.  ", "Previous approach coupled with our ongoing dividend, we're committed to delivering consistent and superior returns to our shareholders over the long-term and with that, I'll pass it over to John.", "Doug Shapiro", "", "This is Doug; actually it's come to our attention that there are some sound problems on the call.  If you can bear with us we're going actually try dialing back in, please stay on the line we'll be back to you very shortly.", "[Break in audio]", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "This is Jeff, apparently the sound coming out of the telephone company was fairly garbled and I hope that we're sounding all right to you now.  If you would \u2013 anybody who hears distortion in the line please email as you did before.  We apologize on behalf of the carrier and I won't repeat all of my remarks for your benefit and I'll pass it to John Martin.", "John K. Martin", "", "As usual there are slides that are now available on our website to help you follow along with my remarks.  The first slide contains several financial highlights.  Coming into the year we had several goals that we wanted to accomplish in the face of a difficult economic environment.  ", "First, to deliver strong relative financial performance by focusing on our operations, second to complete the spin of Time Warner Cable and third to maintain a strong balance sheet while both investing fully in our businesses and increasing returns to shareholders.", "With only two months to go in the year we are on track to deliver on or exceed each of these goals.  Through the third quarter, our content group's adjusted OIBDA is up 2% despite an over $500 million drop in advertising revenue.  As Jeff mentioned, this performance has allowed us to raise our full year outlook.  ", "From a structural standpoint, we're not only completed the separation of Time Warner Cable in March, but we're also on track to spin out AOL by the end of this year.  So as you might imagine it's been a very busy year and our strong free cash flow generation has left our balance sheet in terrific shape.  ", "Our leverage ratio was below two times despite increasing investment in our businesses and providing a higher direct return to shareholders.  We're currently on track to return about $2 billion this year through both dividends and share repurchases. ", "Moving over to the next slide which shows our consolidated third quarter financial highlights, just a couple of things to point out here.  We knew coming in to the third quarter that our year-over-year comparisons were going to be very difficult.  ", "And while this quarter was our most challenging of the year, results were actually quite a bit better than we had anticipated.  And we saw upside come from the strong performance of our film slate and improved advertising environment and continued focus on cost.", "Revenues declined 6% which reflected a 12% decline in advertising.  Note that more than half of the total revenue decline was a result of the continued drop in AOL subscription revenue and the negative impact of FX.  ", "Advertising revenue declines actually improved somewhat sequentially and our content group revenues were down only 3%, that's the smallest decline so far this year.  Adjusted OIBDA was down and that was primarily due to continued challenges at AOL, and our publishing division, as well as in almost 700 basis point drag related to pension, FX, and restructuring charges.  As I mentioned earlier, content group adjusted OIBDA was down 1% for the quarter but up 2% year-to-date.  ", "Notwithstanding revenue declines and the impact of unfavorable FX and higher pension expenses, consolidated margins were relatively flat compared to last year as we continue to focus on cost management across the company.  Our content group margins were up again in the quarter as a result of margin expansion at each of our film and networks divisions.  And lastly on this slide, our adjusted EPS was $0.61 in the quarter and we've now generated $1.51 year-to-date through September.  ", "Let me move briefly on to each of our divisions and I'll begin at our networks.  Advertising revenues were almost flat to the year ago quarter.  Domestic entertainment networks posted another quarter of low single-digit growth but this was more than offset by continued softness at our international networks including the impact of unfavorable FX and the difficult comparisons at our domestic news operations.  Please recall that our domestic news ad revenue was up 19% in the third quarter of last year.  ", "Subscription revenue growth reflected the consolidation of HBO Latin America had higher affiliate fees at each of Turner and HBO.  Unfavorable FX remained a drag in the quarter.  The decline in content revenues this quarter was largely a result of lower ancillary sales of HBO's original programming.  Last year included the sale of the final season of the Sopranos into syndication and this revenue decline was offset in part by the effective lower than anticipated home video returns of roughly $25 million.  ", "Looking beyond 2009, we're optimistic that HBO's slate of original programming will again boost content sales.  In addition to higher revenues, adjusted OIBDA of $1.1 billion benefited from lower marketing and news gathering costs and the consolidation of HBO Latin America.  As expected, year-over-year margin expansion was more modest this quarter as compared to what we experienced in the first half of the year, and that was a result of higher programming expenses at Turner, which reflected the timing of our original programming launches in the summer.  So that was planned for.  ", "Other cost declines offset the higher programming expenses and through the third quarter our networks adjusted OIBDA is up 11% with 200 basis points of margin expansion.  Scatter is pacing very well with pricing solidly up double digits above upfront levels right now.  However, we expect advertising revenue to decline in the fourth quarter and that will be due to the lower upfront pricing even more difficult comparisons at our CNN division against lat year's U.S. presidential election and to a much lesser degree recent entertainment ratings trends.  ", "Turning to our film group.  As Jeff described, Warner Brothers is having another standout outstanding year.  Going into this quarter we fully expected our films adjusted OIBDA to be down year-over-year and that's due to at least three things.  The first is in games tough comparisons where we had two highly successful Lego branded releases last year.  Second, a continuing softness in the home video environment.  And third, the negative impact of FX as Warner Brothers is our most international division.  ", "However, the film slate performed quite a bit better than what we had expected resulting in film actually posting a small 1% OIBDA growth rate in the quarter.  Expenses also continue to run favorable to a year ago.  In fact, excluding restructuring charges of $85 million this year and $130 million in 2008, margins have expanded by over 150 basis points year-over-year through the third quarter at our film division.  ", "We also continue to expect very strong results in the upcoming fourth quarter as our successful summer films, Harry Potter and The Hangover will be released on home video.  We also have promising theatrical releases in the quarter, including Sherlock Holmes and Invictus.  ", "Moving over to publishing.  Difficult advertising conditions continue with this division with ad revenues down 22% in the third quarter.  That was an improvement, however, versus earlier quarters in the year and we expect that the fourth quarter will show even more improvement.  Bookings have been generally improving.  In fact, based on current bookings food, auto and beauty categories are now pacing to show year-over-year increases in the fourth quarter, and that is very encouraging.  ", "Subscription trends also continue to improve relative to the first half of this year.  About a third of the subscription decline was driven by unfavorable FX with the rest a result of lower domestic newsstand sales and the lingering impact of lower renewals during the height of the credit crisis.  Similar to last quarter, renewal rates have improved from the lower rates experienced at the height of the credit crisis.", "Management is also continuing to focus on costs here but the magnitude of the revenue declines pushed margins lower in the quarter.  Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to see additional improvements in the pace of revenue declines due to easier comparisons and improving business fundamentals.  Fourth quarter results will also reflect the charge of up to $100 million and that's tied to the restructuring initiatives that Jeff described a little earlier.  ", "Moving over to AOL.  We saw only a slight improvement in advertising trends in the quarter down 18%.  That compares to a 20% decline in the first quarter and a 21% decrease in the second quarter.  Looking at the components, AOL Media, which includes both display and page search, remain soft.  Display declined less than the overall category with domestic advertising showing a sequential improvement relative to the second quarter.  ", "We continue to see declines, however, in page search revenues from Google, which fell 24%.  As has been the case in recent quarters, the decrease is primarily due to lower query volume and lower click through rates on the AOL client.  Additionally, cost per click at certain properties continue to be adversely affected by algorithmic changes made by Google. ", "The biggest sequential improvement came from our third party network where year-over-year revenue declines improved substantially relative to the second quarter of this year and that was due to higher demand from brand advertisers.  ", "Shifting to the rest of AOL's results.  Subscription revenues continued to decline as AOL lost 438,000 subscribers in the third quarter.  That's the lowest quarterly subscriber loss since the start of the transition to a free service back in 2006.  Margins declined both year-over-year and sequentially as continued cost declines were not sufficient to offset revenue declines.  AOL is currently weighing some additional restructuring plans but pending those steps it will be challenging to materially reduce its fixed cost base much further.  ", "Even with meaningful additional restructurings, however, we expect AOL will face margin and earnings pressure for some time in light of projected declines and high margin subscription and search revenue.  Year-to-date, AOL has incurred $83 million of restructuring costs and that includes $10 million in the third quarter.  The next slide, which I'll just touch on briefly, shows our corporate expenses which were essentially flat year-over-year.  ", "Let me turn now to our business outlook.  As both Jeff and I previously mentioned this morning, we raised our 2009 adjusted EPS outlook to at least $2.05.  and as Jeff described, our new outlook now takes into account anticipated restructuring charges of up to $100 million in publishing.  ", "We're also providing a full year outlook for the content group and because of our expectation that AOL will be spun off before the end of the year and if we meet that goal, AOL will be reflected as a discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements following the spin-off and will no longer be reflected in our adjusted EPS figures.  ", "We expect content group adjusted EPS to be at least $1.75.  that also includes the fourth quarter charge and that's off a base of $1.42 last year.  So that's up around 25% or at least mid single digits when you exclude 2008's legal reserve.  This outlook obviously implies a significant increase in fourth quarter adjusted EPS relative to a year ago, but please recall that last year's fourth quarter it includes both the $271 million legal reserve, as well as $160 million of restructuring charges at publishing.  ", "Moving on to free cash flow on the next slide which highlights the detail.  Our cash generation remains quite strong and we delivered over $1 billion in free cash flow this quarter now above $3 billion year-to-date.  Through the third quarter, our conversion ratio was over 60%.  As expected, this is lower than last year's third quarter as a result of higher cash taxes and fluctuations in working capital.  ", "Our cash taxes have increased due to the reduction in our NOLs and recall that our working capital benefited last year in part due to the writer's strike.  You can also see from the slide that we're pacing favorable on CapEx and product development and we expect those trends to continue throughout the end of the year as well.  ", "The next slide looks at our net debt.  We ended the third quarter with $10.4 billion in net debt and that's about flat with the second quarter.  That's because our free cash flow that I just discussed a little earlier was offset by our ongoing dividend, our share repurchase program and the repurchased of Google's 5% stake in AOL.  And as I noted earlier, we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet while both fully investing in our businesses and increasing direct returns to shareholders.", "Our strong free cash flow through September has allowed us to accomplish each of these goals.  We've invested more in our businesses this year than last year, and as of today, we have returned around $1.6 billion to shareholders this year.", "This includes both the dividend and nearly $1 billion in share repurchases.  We ended the quarter with about $7 billion of cash on hand.  However, as I've discussed before, we don't intend to operate at these types of cash levels over the longer term and in fact, we expect cash to decline by at least $2 billion this quarter, due to a debt maturity later this month.", "And I'd also point out that we don't plan to shift debt over to AOL prior to the separation, so once we spin AOL, our leverage ratio should be around two times, and that's a little closer to our long-term target of about two and a half times.", "Leverage will also move probably a little bit higher in the fourth quarter, as a result of our continued returns to shareholder through both dividends and share buybacks.  So that concludes my proactive remarks, and as always, thanks for listening in and again, apologies for the audio difficulties.  Let me turn it over to Doug and would be happy \u2013 Jeff and I'd b happy to answer your questions.", "Doug Shapiro", "If you could please when we go to the Q&A please try to hold yourself to one question so we can get to as many callers as possible. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).  Our first question comes from Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse. ", "Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I just have one question on the Turner Cable Networks that comes in two parts.  I think it was John, you mentioned that some of the entertainment ratings are a little soft.  So maybe, Jeff, could you talk a little bit about what the plans are to address the issues and maybe what the issues are specifically?  And then the second part is you indicated that scatter pricing is up double digits versus the upfront.  Could you just share with us what scatter pricing is doing on a year-over-year basis?  Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "At Turner Entertainment Networks, we have seen some rating softness in September and October and we're not happy with it.  But let me give you the context for it because both those networks are having a very successful time, generally, and Turner's having a great year.", "Ratings can vary over short periods of time, and we think that September and October were anomalies.  We had different, basically different programming.  And it amounts to different comparisons last year, in the sense that the programming lineup that was on TBS, TNT had fewer premieres of original episodes in September and October than it had last year.", "We ended up with three fewer major league baseball playoff games in 2009 versus 2008.  We had fewer new series on the key comedy launches at TBS this year and we didn't have at TBS any network premiere movies in October, whereas we had two the prior year.  Now there is \u2013 so those are essentially scheduling that we'll move around and some will show up in the current month.", "On acquired programming, we're watching that carefully because sometimes it takes a while for new acquired shows to find an audience and some of our newer acquired shows haven't had as much of an out-of-the-gate burst as previous year launches have.", "And in addition to that, we're making some changes and expect some improvements in this.  TNT, for example, just acquired Southland from Warner Brothers.  And that is a pretty big statement that TNT can air a critically acclaimed show that broadcast networks dropping audiences and economic structures can't any longer support.", "Lopez Tonight, George Lopez is launching next week on TBS, and we think that is going to be quite a big change in late night.  And Ray Romano's Men of a Certain Age is premiering in December.  We are also making some scheduling changes for our acquired series in terms of when they air.", "And the NBA season is starting strong.  The 2009 and 10 NBA season began with its most-viewed opening night in the history.  It was up in NBA.  It was up about 40 to 45% from last year's opening night doubleheader.", "So this kind of September-October ratings weakness would have an impact if it was a sustained trend, but we don't think that it is and whatever effect it will have, I don't think it's likely to be large and it won't be immediate.", "On the question of scatter, I think what you're asking is how is the scatter this year versus the scatter last year?  And basically, in the fourth quarter what we're seeing is scatter up mid-single digits over last year's.  In fourth quarter scatter, we're seeing up mid-single digits over last year's up-fund.", "And compared to last year's fourth quarter scatter is stronger, but it's offset a little bit, not much, by the fact that the upfront for everybody was down slightly from last year, so scatter-on-scatter, year-to-year is up somewhat.", "Scatter versus upfront is up solidly as you heard from the [peers] that reported in the last few days, versus basically up in the double digits.  So it is true the business is looking a little closer to air than usual, some visibility's limited, but we're seeing basically upward pressure.", "Doug Shapiro", "Yes, I just want to clarify one thing because I might have confused myself.  But in terms of characterizing up versus not up, scatter versus upfront is up solidly.  It was in my remarks, basically strong double digit and scatter versus scatter is also up.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes.", "Doug Shapiro", "But not as much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Jeff, I wanted to ask you about the film segment, when you look at the two businesses there, Warner Brother's T.V., Warner Brother's Film, how you think about just sort of the secular growth of those two businesses?  Obviously, the revenue mix in film is changing a bit as we go through changes in the home-video market.", "And on the T.V. side, international syndication's been a big opportunity.  How do you think about putting capital to work in those two somewhat different businesses?  Do you think the cost structure in each are appropriate, and where are the bigger opportunities between the two, maybe bigger challenges?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "On the long-term home-video outlook I think that home entertainment environment is stabilizing and will continue to next year.  The retail environment's still challenging as little less shelf space that some of the big retailers are putting to DVDs and home video.  But I think we're going to see the pressure on physical sell-through moderate a bit.  We do expect continued growth in rental electronic sell-through, VOD and blu-ray.  And we think that the net contribution ratios will increase, due to the higher margin digital elements of home video.", "Staying on film, we've been seeing, which we were saying in our remarks, if you can hear mine through the tech difficulties.  We've been seeing very strong and consistent performance, partly because of the really long-term advantage that Warner has built in having so many franchises, partly because we have streamlined the slate to fewer releases with big economics tied to them.", "So on film, we basically are very optimistic about, in our case, unlike every other studio, very consistent performance of film slates year-to-year and we think that will continue.  If you go over to television, we've got a production business growing very strong despite the challenges in some markets.  It really is, if this answers your question, a high-profit business for us, and it's lower risk than film but you don't want to overproduce into what the envelope of bios, which has something to do with network T.V", "And we all know that the business has changed a bit but gradually over the years as the broadcast networks look towards in-house programming.  But that has worked out, and this is not new as an advantage for us, because we are the supplier of second choice to all four of the big networks.", "And we increasingly have a buy pressure about demand coming from cable networks.  Some of them are our own but not only our own.  If you go to your, I think you asked a little bit about syndication and overseas.  We've got a pretty healthy market for our network series production overseas.", "And on the syndication business, we're fairly happy with what we've been able to do, to the extent that syndication, if it's true, it's not clear what will happen.  If it goes kind of vertical to in-house supplies, we've got a pretty good position and it's not a huge part of our revenue business.  So all in all, I would give you a summary on television that says we think we can continue to grow it and continue to produce fairly consistent earnings and cash flow.  ", "John K. Martin", "At the risk of making a longer answer slightly longer, I do just want to just add on from a capital deployment standpoint, we do think a lot about the absolute level of capital that we're committing to this business.  And we feel like we are at or about the right range at this moment in time with the right split between theatrical and TV, and we're going to continue to focus on improving the returns in the studio business and it's going to not only come from top line growth, but by also managing the operational efficiency of the business.", "So let me just give you one example.  One of the reasons why Warner is having such a great year this year against the backdrop of a tough home entertainment environment is because they've done a phenomenal job this year of cutting out costs in their home entertainment division.  ", "And if you just think about the initiatives that they've undertaken.  They've cut SG&A double-digit percentage over a year ago level.  They've cut marketing and improved the efficiency of marketing spend by even more as a percentage of total spend, and they don't feel like it's really impacted their sell-through units.  ", "And they've taken a much more stringent approach to their shipment of good which has resulted in lower returns, which you've seen us make some slight adjustments to our returns reserve, all of which is a reflection of improved profitability against the business.  And we got to continue to take that approach.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein.  ", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "I have one for John and Jeff, you guys can choose it.  I'm trying to figure kind of a core expense growth rates for your domestic Turner networks and domestic HBO, the first three quarters of the year.  So what has been a kind of the core growth rate, let's say, for Turner and HBO separately, first three quarters of the years?  And what's a sustainable rate into the future on an expense basis?  ", "John K. Martin ", "I could take a crack at it; Jeff can fill in where I miss something, but the one thing, Michael, and I think this has been a consistent message with us all along which I that it's always we would caution against looking at particular quarters.  And we're really managing the business over annual cycles.  And so we had really favorable expense trends in the first half of this year, and a lot of it was tied to two things.  ", "Number one was sports where we had lower amortization of sports costs this year versus they year ago first half of the year, and a lot of that fell in the second quarter.  And then we also had a lot of our original and newly acquired programming airing and broadcasting in the third and fourth quarters of this year.  So we would see a natural lift in programming costs more on the third and fourth quarter side.  ", "I think generally speaking, though, if you think about just the way that we're trying to run the networks, and that's true for each of Turner as well as HBO over the longer term, is to try to have expense growth be contained at a percentage that's lower than revenue growth.  I think we've been doing that.  We're on track to do that again this year.  We expect margin expansion at each of HBO and Turner and I would continue to expect to see that going forward in 2010 and beyond.  Although, again, just we can be lumpy or volatile within year just in particular quarters, so hopefully that helps.  ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "If you're asking whether margins will go up, they will.  ", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "I guess the follow up would be would there be any more per end spend if you had to spend more on TNT or readdress your programming strategies?  What would that necessarily mean a change in the programming spend into next year?  ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "No, that's just a question of where we direct the allocation of essential a rough envelope of programming spending.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  ", "Jessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "It looks like you recently expanded your cable network footprint in Japan as well as Central Europe.  So can you help us think about your international expansion strategy in the cable networks and how large of an investment you intend to make over the next year or so.  Which brands could see the most expansion?  Do you intend to develop any new brands?  And what parts of the world would most interest you?  ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We have been looking to grow internationally, but  in a targeted way.  We're essentially in general focused on either of the fast growing regions which would be if you're doing geographic, Latin America, Eastern Europe, India.  Or the fastest growing sectors within even developed economies which essentially would, because those are slowing growing in the long run.  And those sectors would essentially be some local production and TV networks.  ", "If you look at what we've done and what you see in HBO's recent activities, we have been buying in our partner shares in HBO, which is number one wherever it operates and it operates across Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia, and we're now in a majority ownership position in all of those that would be one.  ", "Two is we have worldwide launch and distribution of most of our big recognized networks, CNN, Cartoon, HBO, little more the Turner classic movies, less consistently TBS TNT and what we've been doing, CME being an example, is in targeted regions buying into those network companies that we think are ones that can be leaders in both broadcasting and multi-channel cable satellite broadband distribution.  ", "CME is one of those, and we got in  a position where we have a pretty good participation in the economics of it now and we believe we have a fairly good position if we were to acquire a larger stake in it or manage it in a more coordinated fashion with Warner, Turner, HBO, and other kinds of channels.  ", "Last, I would say there's a fairly long established and increasing every year effort at Warner's to do local production of films.  We're one of the larger producers, net negative cost plus distribution, of local language films in Europe, South America, and Asia.  And we have now started unit for TV series and format production as well.  So that is essentially the current scope of what we're doing internationally.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Greenfield \u2013 Pali Research.  ", "Richard Greenfield \u2013 Pali Research", "When you think about AOL, obviously John's comments were that they were pretty disappointing in terms of the lack of improvement and you're kind of running out of major cost cuts.  And I'm just wondering, you seem very confident in continuing to move forward with the AOL spend.  How do you think about the prospects for AOL post-spend given the environment?   How should people be thinking about that entity as a separate entity given the difficulties the business is clearly having?  ", "And then two, just a quick follow-up on the whole [inaudible] franchises.  You've got the Sherlock Holmes, just curious what your long-term rights to Sherlock Holmes are if that is successful.  I think you've got Happy Feet 2 coming in 2011.  And do you have all rights to follow ups to The Hobbit if that work in 2011 as well?  I just would love to get some color on kind of upcoming franchises that you might have.  ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "On the franchise question, I think we have there's some complexities with The Hobbit in terms of whose got what.  We have about half of it at this point.  But everything else we have.  ", "On your AOL question, basically AOL has a lot of scale and they've got some very successful consumer products inside the AOL experience.  Essentially the new management has identified several opportunities where AOL has competitive advantages, and they're going to do a road show in the next couple of weeks which I think will provide everybody a lot more insight than I should give on this call.", "Essentially they're focusing on core strengths in Web content, communications, and ad monetization, and the key areas are to expand their content properties, some of which really do have a lead position against all the competitors to pursue local content initiatives and mapping opportunities.  They've got some fairly lead share communication offerings that they want to enhance.  And as you know, they have a very strong and leading third party network for ad sales, which admittedly there are a lot of competitors in that now.  But that's a significant platform on which to build.  ", "So if you take that and add to it the cash flow from the subscription business and some of the fairly advantaged user habits that the subscribers to AOL have in terms of traffic use and monetization, they've got those building blocks on which to compete in the new company.  ", "The only thing I would add, I think the first part of your question asked about our commitment to continuing to spit it out now, we remain fully committed to complete the spin because it's our firm view that AOL is going to be better off being on a separate footing as opposed to be being part of Time Warner.  So there's nothing as it relates to the state of the business that it would be enhanced by virtue of continuing to remain part of Time Warner.  ", "And one of the decisions that we made in terms of our initial balance sheet capital structure of AOL, basically sending it out debt free, is we want to make sure that AOL is in the best position to succeed and we want it to have more than adequate flexibility as it moves forward to be able to make the decisions that it needs to do.  The right size, the cost structure of the business and continue to make the right investments going forward. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Morris \u2013 UBS. ", "Michael Morris \u2013 UBS", "My question pertains to the relationship between Warner Bros. Television and the Turner Networks.  Specifically, you spoke to moving Southland, which was on NBC over to Turner.  The question is it seems like a logical progression for a show like Southland why hasn't it happened more in the past? ", "What will it take for Southland to work and can we expect more changes like this in the future?  Are there some synergies between owning those two entities that can be taken more advantage of going forward?  Thank you. ", "John K. Martin", "Yes well first of all I agree with the idea of the question.  I think the premise isn't right.  We're the number one company right now and have been for awhile at buying and selling programming to ourselves.  So it's not why it hasn't worked better, it's why haven't others done it as well as we have?", "And that's essentially why we've got the number one position in program sales, to other people have worked and to our own.  We buy about 25% of Turner programming coming from our own company Warner.  ", "And Warner is selling about 25% of their sales out to Turner.  Similar numbers for HBO and you can't really be number one as a consistently as we are in both the film side of Warner's and the series sales side of Warner's unless you are both selling to everybody that's in the buyer's market, meaning all the other networks and optimizing your sales to the leading network company which is us.  ", "So I would just urge you because I keep saying it.  I hope everybody kind of checks it and realizes that the number is substantiated,  that you can't have which is why our competition doesn't have the kind of consistency and the high level of earnings unless you can do both, and so the most recent examples are Mentalist and Southland, huge hits from Warner's onto the broadcast networks and award critically acclaimed.  ", "There are some very high profile examples of times like Sopranos when we made a decision to sale the program for a lot of money to another network.  Not in other words having had it on HBO and not sold it to Turner which we could have, but we frankly thought that Turner could buy more appropriate programming for it and we could sale Sopranos for more money to A&E which is what we did. ", "So we, basically, will continue to optimize that and the good news for us is because we've got the leading basic networks and the leading pay networks we can be the advantaged buyer and so that when we sale to ourselves we'll do it and not have any kind of subsidy problems.  ", "But as the leading seller we absolutely need to keep alive the other customer, which are the four broadcast networks and other cable other networks, because that's the only way between them and our own networks that we can keep the lead level of sales in both theatrical and TV.  ", "Just to finish, because I hope you can tell I'm a little focused on this point and have been for more than five years.  We basically have more franchises than any other company if you look at films and part of the reason is the way that we mix internal buying and external buying.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Douglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Douglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "You just actually mentioned Jeff the need to keep your broadcast customers alive in a sort of interesting details and my question I am interested in your view as to whether the balance of negotiating leverage between Turner and HBO and their pay TV distributors is or might be shifting.", "I ask that because the broadcast TV groups are dramatically expanding their retransmission consent, compensation, CBS started the process of course by asking for cash which FOX and soon ABC are going to be pushing that up to 75 cents a sublevel.", "When I asked the cable and satellite companies how they are going to push through that, they all they're going to be much tougher on cable network rates, drop networks, pay lower prices or no price increases and so I'm wondering as that waves or it hits the beach how do you feel about your position with HBO and Turner?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I feel it's getting stronger.  So we think the big must have, big reach networks will gain bargaining leverage in the coming years.  I think some of what I think that you're asking if you're conveying what some of the distributor level companies are saying I would not agree with which is that there essentially and this is good and it's also the direction of public policy in Washington.  ", "They are competing with evermore distribution choices.  So Telco's, cable, satellite, broadband and all of those as they compete need the strong identifiable brands like CNN, HBO, TNT and so forth, so if you have the strong and lead brands in those categories with a lot of reach you're going to see the leverage go up.  ", "If the issue that we're talking about here is whether an attempt long waited for by broadcasters to move to some retrans consent is going to be increasing rather than weakening competition for strong cable networks I would go with the cable networks not the broadcasters and I would just site the record low shares for broadcast networks which has stabbed down into the mid 20s.", "Cable being at its highest level, broadcast now being at its lowest and as you know the economics of those things they are basically unable increasingly to finance and schedule compelling programs.  So I think we have a very clear few on it and I would just finish by saying it may be possible for distributors, cable, satellite, Telco, to do some efficiencies in their program buying to weaker networks.", "But I think what you'll see is a bigger separation between the strong branded networks which is what we have and some of the niche weaker ones that were frankly carried in the past by momentum, by their ownership, by the broadcast companies that were essentially porting retransmission from broadcast over to some associated co-owned cable network and I think that's what happened. ", "Douglas Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Okay, let's follow that up with would you see HBO seeking fixed rate contract deals like Showtime and Starz have been doing?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "No.  ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony Diclemente \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Anthony Diclemente \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Jeff I just have one more broader industry question for you if I may.  It sounds like there is an increasing concern out there that media measurement isn't keeping up with new technology for viewership of content both on TV and online.  So maybe could just talk a little bit about what the concerns are in the industry exactly and what the goals are that you have for the new coalition that's been formed?  Thank you. ", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "", "Yes, I think the entire network industry simply wants to keep the measurement technology in practice, keep it up with the reality of consumers watching, first of all on demand so in delay and secondly across multiple devices, both of which things are not that easily or well measured by the old sample based viewing that Nielson has done.  ", "Now Nielson knows all that and is trying to upgrade and modernize and improve their methods and I think everyone welcomes that.  What the industry, the network and show producing industry wants to see is to have them move forward, which they are trying to do and to investigate any other methods, including census based methods that use either set top boxes or obviously broadband views of video are highly trackable just like everything on broadband is highly trackable, and you can do those things on more of a minute-to-minute interact of [inaudible] targeted basis. ", "So I think it's just a natural effort by the industry as consumption and platforms change to keep the measurement capabilities up to speed with what's happening in all these different methods of distribution and it obviously would strike everyone that if you simply had one entity doing that you're not likely to get as much innovation as if you have several doing it.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). Today's conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.", "I will now turn the call over to Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Doug Shapiro", "Thanks a lot and welcome to Time Warner's 2009 fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call.", "Before we begin, there are several items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. The reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included our website.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and further reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Lastly, just please keep in mind that the company has presented the operating results for Time Warner Cable and AOL as discontinued operations for all periods presented.", "With that let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeff Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. We began 2009 with an ambitious agenda and we achieved what we set out to do. So as a result, Time Warner is better positioned today than ever. We've got strong operational and financial momentum and there is increasing evidence that industry trends are going our way.", "And now I think we are structured to run our businesses more aggressively than ever. We delivered very strong adjusted earnings per share growth last year despite the worst recession in most of our lives. Our Networks and Film businesses posted record profits driven largely by the strength of our content and that performance underscores two things that we have discussed before.", "Demand is growing with the kind of high quality contents that we make as consumers enjoy more choices, it also shows how our unique combination of scale, brands and talent enables us to institutionalize success in hit-driven businesses.", "In 2009, we approved the efficiency and productivity of businesses by reallocating resources. We substantially raised our investment in programming and production, and that's critical to drive our revenue and extend our competitive position, and we still increase margins by significantly reducing overhead expense. ", "While we're doing that, we strengthened our balance sheet last year as well while doubling our return of capital to shareholders. Free cash flow totaled almost $3 billion and we returned over $2 billion of that or more than 70% to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. ", "We also spun off Time Warner Cable and AOL, and that allowed us to focus all our energy in resources on what we do best, making and distributing the most compelling branded content on traditional and emerging platforms and monetizing it better than anyone else. In 2010 and beyond, we will build on this foundation. ", "As you saw in this morning's outlook release, we expect to grow our adjusted EPS mid-teens in 2010. We will do that by executing even more aggressively on the four operational priorities that I've discussed with you before. The first is leveraging our scale and brands to create the highest quality content and monetize it better than anyone else. ", "Second, make our operations more efficient by allocating resources to the best and most productive use. Third, we're going to keep expanding internationally. And fourth, we're developing new business models that capitalize on changes in consumer usage and technology well at the same time ensuring when possible that they are additive and not cannibalistic, we are going to talk more about that.", "In practice this means that we will again spend more on programming and production in 2010. We will invest more in new digital initiatives and extend our brands internationally and we will do that while keeping our overall expenses relatively flat. ", "And I'd like to expand on what that means at each of our four divisions. So I'll start with Turner. We made considerable investments in original programming last year to make sure that our networks become even more attractive for our viewers our advertisers and our affiliates. We had a lot of successes. Last year TNT's original drama [screwed] ratings in the same times last five, over 50% over the prior year. And three of its new original series ranked in cables top 5.", "Just to pick one of them TBS debuted the well past Tonight Show to double digit gain in its time slot and in its first few weeks it out delivered most other late night talk shows in the valuable 18 to 34 demo.", "However, not every new original or acquired theories worked or connected with viewers as much as we would have like. We are making changes where necessary and remain confident as we have been that will attract growing audience or over the long term.", "In 2010, just to give you view of that we will bring back kid shows like The Closer and leverage the TNT, while developing new original drama, such as the new series from Steven Spielberg and George Clooney. We will also expand our original programming lineup on TBS. I'd like to point out that we expect our entertainment networks to grow ad revenue for the year, even without a major rebound in rating trends which we will be working to do it well.", "At CNN, we invest tremendous resources on news gathering to deliver the most comprehensive non-partisan news and analysis in the industry and do it across all platforms. If you've watched CNN during the tragedy in Haiti, you know that the depth and breadth of our coverage is unparallel.", "CNN's ratings vary depending on the news environment. We typically outperform our pierce significantly during major news events as more people turn to CNN than anywhere else. And we have lower ratings when the news cycle is slow. But CNN's position as the premium, biggest-reach, multi-platform brand in the news business enables us to consistently command premium pricing from advertisers.", "In fact, despite of ratings declines this last year compared to the record performance in the 2008 election year, CNN again grew its profits by double digits in 2009. This year we expect another year of strong profit growth at CNN.", "HBO, the performance at HBO last year illustrates that its value proposition has never been better. It aired four of the six highest rated shows in its entire history and it grew its subscriber base for the year despite the recession. This year HBO is bringing back the next season of our highest rated shows, including True Blood, Entourage, Hung and Big Love.", "Well to view The Pacific, the highly anticipated mini series from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, that's the companion to Band of Brothers and we will premier Martin Scorsese's Boardwalk Empire which is poised to be HBO's next breakout kids show. ", "Both, Turner and HBO will keep expanding internationally this year too. Turner's international business currently operates more than 100 feeds across 200 countries. We will expand organically by launching new feeds in new markets and adding new distributors. We will also make acquisitions where it makes sense. For example we recently agreed to acquire NDTV Imagine which is a general entertainment network in India. It will significantly increase our presence and scale in that region.", "HBO has over 33 million subscribers internationally. That's at HBO Latin America, HBO Asia and HBO Central Europe. And it's the leading pay-TV provider in each of these markets. We plan to extend this lead as we rollout new features like On Demand. ", "Altogether we expect our international cable networks business and related content sales to generate more than $400 million of adjusted OIBDA in 2010. And they are set to grow even faster than our domestic networks. In TV, as in film and magazines we are leading the charge to develop digital business models that enhance the value of our content, both for us and for consumers.", "In 2010, both Turner and HBO will continue to pioneer the industry-wide 'TV Everywhere' initiative which is basically TV On Demand and on broadband. Turner will be in trials or commercial launch with every major distributor this year, cable satellite and telco and you will soon hear more about HBO's rollout of its streaming service [HBO.com] which will offer three times the content of what's on HBO On Demand today.", "Now let's move over to our studio. Warner Bros performed phenomenally last year too, shattering records everywhere it turns. It broke the all-time global box-office record with more than $4 billion in sales. Seven films crossed the $100 million mark domestic box-office in 2009, that's also a record, including the latest in the Harry Potter franchise, Sherlock Holmes, The Blind Side and The Hangover. The Hangover was the best selling R-rated comedy ever at the box-office and on home video. ", "Even with declines in the home video category industry wide, this performance helped power Warner Brothers to its most profitable year ever, roughly $1.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA and even after a record 2009 slate, we are very optimistic about this year's film slate. 10 fall releases include the seventh Harry Potter, Sex and the City 2, Inception a film from Christopher Nolan who directed the Dark Knight, Due Date from Todd Phillips who gave us the Hangover, Clash of the Titans and Guardians of Ga'hoole which is a 3-D CGI film based on the popular Young Adults books series.", "In the next few months, you'll also hear more about our plans to mine more aggressively the deep catalogue of DC Comics characters across Warner Brothers' theatrical, home video, TV and games divisions and across our other divisions as well.", "Turning to the television production business, very important business. As you may know, in most years, Warner TV production contributes as much as half the profits in our filmed entertainment division. This year, Warner will continue to develop and foster the relationships with A-list writers and directors that's made us the number one provider of broadcast TV programming for 18 of the past 23 years. And that's enabled us to produce hits like Two and a Half Men and Big Bang Theory which are the two top comedies on TV right now. ", "We see encouraging secular dynamics this year and over the next several years. With recent signs that broadcasters may be able to secure our cash carriage fees and NBC\u2019s recent decision to resume broadcasting scripted programming at 10 PM and the robust marketplace for both original and off network programming on cable, demand for high quality scripted programming seems to be going up, and that is right in Warner TV's sweet spot. ", "Last year, we parlayed our leading position at the box office and on TV into the number one share in the home video business for the ninth consecutive year, that included Warner's being number one in every category, standard definition, Blu-ray high def, VOD and electronic sell-through.", "In 2010, we'll continue to lead the transition of the home video business to digital, which carries higher gross profits for us than physical DVDs. We're also actively working with distributors to make sure that we can offer consumers convenience and a compelling value proposition while ensuring that we're appropriately compensated for our intellectual property. ", "Overall, due to the strength in our film slate, our expectations for another strong year in TV production and our progress in home video business, we believe that Warner Bros is set to deliver another year of very strong profits coming up in 2010. ", "On to Time Inc, we recently announced that we and several other publishers have formed a consortium to develop common technology standards for reading print content on tablets and on other e-reader devices.", "We view these devices as a key way to transition the dual revenue stream print business model to digital. And as these readers grow in popularity, they are proving that consumers will pay for quality content and these readers enhance the kind of content that we can deliver. And as they improve functionality, they hold increasing promise as an advertising medium.", "Just as in our TV and Film business, we intend to lead the way in determining how digital business models evolve here too. Operationally, Time Inc. faced pretty challenging advertising climate last year, but there were clear signs of improvement in the fourth quarter. And testifying to the strength of Times content and brands, in 2009, Time Inc. grew its share of advertising and grew its share of readership.", "This year Time Inc. will continue to reduce its cost structure. The restructuring that we undertook in the fourth quarter should generate about a $100 million in savings on a run-rate basis in 2010 and years after and at the same time, that we are building that in, Time Inc. will continue to distance itself from its competitors by investing in its biggest brands and in high quality editorial content.", "Now John, in a minute will talk more to you about our financial performance in 2009 and our plans for 2010 and our balance sheet. But before I hand it off to John, I would like to touch on how we're approaching our capital management this year.", "Philosophically, I think one of our most important jobs is to actively manage our capital to enhance the organic returns of our businesses and maintain a strong balance sheet as we go on. In line with this goal, our Board increased our dividend and authorized an increase in our remaining stock repurchase authorization to $3 billion.", "As a result, we now provide by far the highest dividend payout ratio and the highest yield of any of our peers in media and we are on pace to return even more capital in 2010 than we did last year. These steps reflect our confidence in the future of high quality content over the long term, confidence in our strategic and competitive position, and confidence that we can deliver steady superior returns to stockholders year by year and over the long term.", "We think that the more you know about today's Time Warner, the more you will share this confidence and we are looking forward to talking more with you about this in detail across each of our businesses at our Investor Day that we have scheduled in late May. We will be sending out details soon. With that I'd like to turn the call over to John.", "John Martin", "", "Thanks Jeff, and good morning, everyone. And let me begin by saying that there are slides that are now available on our website to help you follow along with my comments. And beginning on the first slide you will see some brief highlights and observations, some of which Jeff has made already. Despite the difficult environment we had a number of important financial achievements in 2009 and we did accomplish all of our objectives.", "First, we delivered strong financial performance, next we completed the spins of both Time Warner Cable and AOL and further we maintained a very strong balance sheet while both investing fully in our businesses and increasing direct returns to shareholders.", "Our fourth quarter results allowed us to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.83 for the year and that compares to our full year adjusted EPS outlook of at least $1.75. This EPS figure was also a significant improvement over 2008.", "We also continue to generate significant levels of free cash flow with a very high full-year conversion ratio of 50% of adjusted OIBDA. And this enabled us to return $2.1 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases and that represented over 70% of our precash.", "And as Jeff mentioned our board authorized both an increase in the annual dividend to $0.85 a share and an increase in our remaining share-repurchase program to about $3 billion. And as we look ahead we are very, very encouraged by both, improving macroeconomic trends and the strong competitive positions of our businesses and we intend to maintain the leadership positions by further improving our operating efficiency and by allocating resources towards areas of higher growth and better returns.", "This year, we'll use our balance sheet strength to fund even more investment in our businesses, we'll improve our capital efficiency and we are on course to return even more capital directly to shareholders. This is all reflected in this morning's outlook.", "This next slide shows our consolidated fourth quarter and full year financial highlights. Fourth quarter revenues increased 2% as higher content and subscription revenues more than offset an 8% decline in advertising revenues. And while advertising was down for the quarter, this did represent a sequential improvement from the 10% drop in the third quarter of 2009 and it did represent the smallest decline that we saw for the entire year. ", "It's also the first quarter of overall revenue growth since the second quarter of 2008, so we are quite pleased with that. Adjusted OIBDA was up very nicely in the fourth quarter and our film studio was a big driver of the growth. Now you do see some pretty large year-over-year profit growth variances in our fourth quarter reported results, please remember that in last year's fourth quarter, we incurred an approximately $270 million of legal charge related to the sale of our winter sports teams.", "Over the course of the past year, we have talked to you also about the impact that we've experienced from higher pension expenses as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and the impact that those have had on our results. For the full year, pension and FX taken together were at almost 600 basis points drag on our adjusted or EBITDA growth.", "Operating expenses which include cost to revenues and SG&A fell by an approximately $1 billion last year for the full year. Margins climbed more than 200 basis points and were higher at three out of our four operating divisions. This reflects our continued cost efforts across the entire company. Full year adjusted EPS was up almost 30% over the year ago results.", "And now let me turn to our segment highlights and we are going to begin with a discussion of our networks. We did have another very strong year at both HBO and Turner and they each recorded their highest annual profits ever. The Network segment represented nearly 60% of the company's profits in the quarter and almost 70% of the profits for the full year. Adjusted OIBDA grew 29% in the quarter and 15% for the year and keep in mind these comparisons reflect the legal charge from a year ago that I just mentioned. And in this year they also reflect a $100 million programming write down at Turner and the consolidation of HBO Latin America.", "Now let me briefly expand on the programming write down for a moment. This was a management decision to take one show off the programming schedule and while programming decisions like this are an ongoing way of doing business here, we don't anticipate incurring anymore write downs of anything close to this size for the foreseeable future.", "As expected advertising revenue declined modestly in the quarter at the networks that were down 4% and although the [scatter] market was very strong for us the decline resulted from difficult comparisons at our news division and as against last year's US Presidential election as well as the impact of lower CPMs in the 2009, 2010 upfront ", "and to a lesser extent lower ratings of the domestic entertainment networks. ", "Looking at the first quarter, scatter pricing is very much above upfront levels. We expect the advertising revenues of the networks to be up in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009 and that's despite continued top comparison with CNN against the inauguration in last year. Subscription revenue growth of 11% in the quarter and 10% for the full year reflected a consolidation of HBO Latin America and rate increases at both Turner and HBO. And as Jeff mentioned HBO finished the year with its highest year end domestic subscriber base ever. The decline in content revenue for the quarter was due to lower video and syndication revenue at HBO's original programming including Sex and the City and The Sopranos.", "Looking ahead we are very optimistic that HBO's slate of original programming will beat to growth in content revenue and that's going to begin this year.", "Before I move on I do want to note as Jeff said that we did recently agree to apply a majority stake in NDTV Imagine, it's one of the leading general entertainment networks in India. India is a country where we see significant opportunity in the coming years and as Jeff described NDTV should help our competitive position their significantly. For 2010 however, NDTV is expected to be a drag in OIBDA profits of about $40 million that was standing matter and despite this we anticipate our international cable networks will be a driver of growth in 2010 as we anticipate that markets to improve", "Moving over to film, Warner Brothers had and absolutely amazing year setting a record for full year profits. This was the seventh straight quarter of adjusted OIBDA growth at our films entertainment division. Adjusted OIBDA lost 41% in the fourth quarter driven by the successful home video releases of Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince and The Hangover and the strong theatrical performances of the Blind Side and Sherlock Holmes.", "Our games business within that division was also contributed to growth in the quarter and we expect to continue in the coming years. Games now generates for us over $500 million annually in revenue and it has helped the margins.", "Thanks to our continued efforts to streamline costs, margins climbed over 200 basis points for the year and heading into this year we have no doubt, we don't doubt our difficult comparisons in this division against the very strong performance last year just to point out a couple of things. One item affecting on 2010 comparisons would be the impact of our decision to self distribute New Line Films overseas instead of pre-selling the rights which is what New Line used to do.", "This should enable us to realize increased profits overtime but for timing and accounting reasons its going to result in a drag of more than a $100 million on OIBDA this year. In addition, 2009's results included approximately $75 million of combined benefits related to [accrual] of participation expense in the resolution of an international tax matter and we wouldn't anticipate similar benefits to recur in 2010.", "Now having said all of that and despite this, let me reiterate what Jeff said which is that we do expect Warner Brothers to once again deliver very, very strong corporate levels again in 2010 and here is why. First, we are optimistic about the strength and the quality of the films late this year. Second, while we expect sales of standard definition DVDs to remain somewhat challenged, we expect continued growth of higher margin Blu-ray, VOD and electronic sell-through to help offset this pressure. ", "And we will be releasing a greater number of titles into home video this year. And lastly, we expect our TV business to have another very, very strong year in 2010 helped by a growing TV syndication pipeline.", "We really didn't have any significant new availabilities of syndicated programming last year in 2009, but we will have several in 2010 including Two and a Half Men on Cable, New Adventures of Old Christine, The Closer, and Supernatural and will also continue to take a hard line on costs in this division.", "Looking at our Publishing division on the next slide. Time Inc's fourth quarter was affected by the tough ad environment, with advertising down 12% in the quarter. This did represent however, a significant sequential improvement rather in year-over-year trends. Domestic advertising revenues were down 9%, and most of this decline was due to fewer ad pages with ad rates down only in the low single digits.", "As you know Time Inc's domestic magazines are operated in three units, and just wanted to note that the Style and Entertainment unit was our strongest performer in the fourth quarter with revenue growth that People Magazine helping keep ad revenue for the Group essentially flat. Most of the advertising softness in the quarter was concentrated in our News segment. ", "Looking ahead to the first quarter, print advertising trends have improved, and that's relative to the fourth quarter and has been largely driven by higher volumes. Our Style and Entertainment Group remains our strongest performer and is tracking up solidly for the quarter. We also saw a sequential improvement in subscription trends in the fourth quarter and that was primarily at newsstand.", "Although subscription renewal rates improved in the last few quarter's, our year-over-year growth rates are still being affected by the lower renewals at the height of the credit crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the first quarter of 2009. Adjusted with our publishing unit increased 27% in the quarter, as lower revenues and higher pension cost were more than offset by cost savings initiatives and lower restructuring charges. On the cost side of the equation, we expect as Jeff mentioned that the restructurings that we took last year should generate about $100 million of cost savings this year.", "Turning next to our 2010 outlook on the next slide. Overall, we expect to return to revenue growth in 2010 due to an improve ad environment steady and healthy subscription revenue trends and a promising content (inaudible). We will increase investments in programming and production will drive our growth this year and over the long term.", "Channel fund these increased investments in this businesses will remain focused on containing overhead expenses and that should definitely benefit operating margins, this is all reflected in the outlook we released this morning and as you saw on the release we expect full year adjusted [OIBDA] increase in the mid teams over the base of $1.83.", "From modeling purposes let me just add that we do expect our booked tax rate to move back up to closer to the 38% range. And it's also worth noting that beginning in the first quarter of this year our intention is to shift away from adjusted OIBDA as being the primary and key profit measure for the company and we'll be focusing more and more on adjusted operating income.", "We believe that adjusted operating income will be more meaningful metric for the company going forward and is also consisting with our increased focus on return on invested capital and [admires] the shift that we have been making and we've made internally for purposes of measuring our own performance.", "Turning next to the next slide, we delivered nearly $3 billion in free cash last year and our conversion ratio was 50%. This is lower than the year ago period, we did expect that and that's as a result of higher cash taxes and fluctuations of working capital offset by lower net cash interest or cash taxes increased due to higher taxable income and the run off of tax attributes that benefited us in the past.", "Recall that our capital benefit in 2008 for lower TV and film productions spending and that was due impart to writer strike that was going on. Our reduced cash interest is in principally the lower debt levels in 2009.", "And I ask you to move to the last slide which just shows the [low board] of our net debt balances. We ended the year with a little over $10.5 billion in net debt, that's about half the level that we had at the beginning of 2008, and it was more or less unchanged from the end of the third quarter.", "In the quarter free cash flow generation was offset by continuing returns to shareholders through our regular dividend and ongoing share repurchases. We ended the year with about $4.8 billion in cash on hand, that's a significant reduction form the $7 billion that we had as of the end of September and the reduction was principally due to the retirement of $2 billion debt maturity in November as well as our continued dividend and share buyback programs.", "In 2009, we significantly enhanced our balance sheet strength and that allowed us to meet three key objectives. First, we increased investments and programming production in CapEx by more than 15%, second, we more than doubled the returns to shareholders and third, we maintain strategic flexibility. As we look ahead, our philosophy on balance sheet management has not changed, and will not change, but our objectives will evolve somewhat. ", "In 2010, we intend to invest even more in our businesses to bolster their competitive position and drive long terms growth. At the same time, we'll improve the efficiency of the balance sheet through further reduction of cash balances and by carefully managing our debt maturities and we are making a great commitment to provide direct returns to stock holders. This is evident in the boards' decision to raise the dividend and increase the share repurchase program. We also believe it's important to maintain strategic flexibility and now that we have complete the AOL separation, our leverage ratio was about two times and that's closer to our long term target of about 2.5 times.", "We plan to maintain as long term leverage target at the 2.5 times level as we believe a strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage. So that concludes my remarks. Thanks for listening and I will turn it over to Doug who will start the Q&A portion.", "Doug Shapiro", "Hey (inaudible) please get started with the Q&A and ask them to please limit themselves to no more than one or two questions so we can get to as many people as possible. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Or first question comes from the line of Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang - Credit Suisse", "I have a two part question on cable networks. Jeff you talked about managing the businesses more aggressively and I know some of your peers have been more aggressive than you on growing affiliate rates. So I was interested in your view on or philosophy on affiliate rate growth for the Turner Networks and what leverage do you have to bring to bear in negotiations with the distributors. And then for John, just on the cable margins, given the investment in programming you talked about, should we expect cable margins to be up in 2010 excluding the programming write-down in the fourth quarter. Thank you.", "Jeff Bewkes", "We have been planned to be as aggressive as possible on affiliate rates. The outlook for affiliate position at both HBO and Turner are pretty strong and has been strong and I think you have to look at comparisons on any year-to-year basis depends on where somebody starts at and if they have lower base rates, they are in a bit of a different situation. We basically have the strongest suite of networks across HBO and Turner in the television world and majority of our revenue under both HBO and Turner is under multi-year contracts with built in escalators. ", "Our strategy as we've been discussing has been to invest heavily to make the networks compelling value propositions. I think that's equally true of HBO as Turner. Turner with the strength in programming and its reach across CNN Headline, truTV, Cartoon Network, TNT and TBS is in a very good position to capture the economic upside, let's say as all those networks become more important and reach and the success of their programming continues to be successful. ", "So, we are very confident about our rate moves going forward including in relation to competition and we do think that the moves towards TV everywhere will simply support the growth in affiliate fee revenue as well. ", "John Martin", "", "Hey Spencer, it's John. Getting to your second question, we've been talking now for sometime about an ongoing program towards management of the network group that would consider margin improvement as a way of an ongoing program for architecture. We did experience nice margin improvements this year and not withstanding the fact that we anticipate increasing our investment programming which we think is critically important.", "The order of magnitude of that increase is not going to be overwhelmingly significant and we're going to continue to try to reallocate funds from SG&A or overhead to be able to fund the programming investments and while we don't have a crystal ball exactly to what the advertising environment is going to do because that obviously will ultimately effect margins, we would anticipate that the trends that we've been seeing in the business which has been margin increases should continue.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Michael Morris of UBS. Michael, you may proceed.", "Michael Morris - UBS", "Follow-up on network since specifically at HBO, can you talk a bit more about the revenue growth profile at HBO? And specifically I believe I understand where you are on subscriptions currently, but you have new initiatives, HBO goes streaming service. Will those be incremental revenue streams for you? And I am particularly thinking about your investment in Content. So, if you up your investment in Content, but additional subscribers in the traditional model don't give you incremental revenue, how is that economically accretive for you beyond just additional DVD sales for example? Thanks. ", "Jeff Bewkes", "Let to subscriptions first and put the Content on top. So basically as you look at when you can do history or the current feature at HBO, every time you put an enhancement multiplex, then VOD, then high def and now HBO going broadband, you strengthen the consumer satisfaction usage and demand for HBO and you support the ability of the entire distribution structure to appropriately capture that whether they do it in across the base pricing or whether they do it in some other form of price capture. So from a consumer point of view, we think it's important and has increased the strength and position of HBO that consumers get all these enhancements without discrete charges for certain aspects of HBO. ", "What that then translates to is very strong pricing power for HBO at the affiliate level and if you look right now, this year or last year '09, 2010, will be same. Very strong sub growth and pricing and marketing growth of HBO through telcos who understand the power of what premium can do.", "And I think cable operators are going to refocus their efforts on premium TV categories and putting out these enhancements in order to remain competitive. So what it all translates to is very strong, across-the-board revenue growth for HBO, both subscriber growth and pricing growth at wholesale.", "What you then do is take the platform that provides to create an ever larger budget for original programming, which you see in HBO's current slate, and it turns it into a successful, it will be The Pacific, Boardwalk Empire, Hung, True Blood, et cetera which will then resume a long-term growth in content revenue. So the overall architecture is a fairly powerful one.", "John Martin", "The only thing I would add, I think the beginning part of your question was directed at revenue, HBO has historically and should continue to be able to produce sort of topline revenue growth in the mid-single digits. The biggest variation to that is content revenue, which had been declining over the past few years because of the pipeline of original programming.", "I said in that my remarks, content revenue is expected to be up in 2010 and we think that that's the beginning of what we hope is a sustainable trend, and then due to really, really terrific management of investment spending and costs in general, generally speaking HBO has experienced margin enhancement year-after-year-after-year and we would expect that to continue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.", "Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "John, you may have touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but could you give us a little color on the puts and takes for cash, cash flow in 2010? I don't know if you expect cash flow conversion to go up versus the '09 50% rate? Any comments on CapEx and working capital and cash taxes would be helpful.", "Jeff, on the Turner front, you talked about CNN and premium pricing on ad rates. I guess when we look at the ratings, they look like they are down quite a bit, ratings don't tell us the whole story for any cable network, particularly in the news segment. But how are you thinking about programming on CNN and the management team and the strategy there? Are you happy with the direction of the network or is there anything, any decisions you are making now to think about tweaking that model at all?", "John Martin", "", "We are not providing any specific guidance as it relates to 2010 free cash flow, but having said that, I am happy to share with you some observations of expectations. The first is, and this is probably the most difficult thing for us to forecast, the specifics on working capital because they can vary quite a bit. We do have a long history I think of managing working capital very tightly and efficiently.", "We don't see anything in this year that would make us assume that anything is going to change and in fact I would anticipate that the free cash flow that is being generated from our divisions is very likely going to go up even year-over-year. And what's embedded in that also, you ask specifically about CapEx, we don't have a very capital-intensive company. CapEx represents only a very, very small percentage of our overall revenue, and having said that our goal is to keep that CapEx as flat as possible this year as we have done in the past.", "The one area where we do anticipate cash usage to go up is cash taxes where we are not anticipating that we are going to get as much benefit from tax planning and certain state tax law changes that we got this year. So that number could be up and overall like I said we are not giving guidance. I don't think the number is going to be materially different from where we were this year.", "Jeff Bewkes", "On the question on Turner, I think you are asking about ratings program and performance, how happy we are with our position and direction. Generally, I'm very happy with where we are competitively on all three of those. The question on ratings, let's get into, because they are not the only thing but of course they are important.", "They are bit of a blunt measurement and there are number of things besides ratings that play into ad revenue and competitive position in affiliate revenue, mix of programming, how much original versus acquired in any given month or quarter, and the mix of scatter versus upfront sales did work their way into the numbers, the level of guarantees on advertising, sellout levels did vary depending how we are looking at economic trends as we saw a lot of variability this year, sponsorships and integrated ad buys online, and what part that plays which changes quarter-to-quarter depending what the programming is. And then you go through the different categories, let's take news. We had a huge year in '08, not as good as in prime time in '09, but some pretty good numbers in other parts of the schedule and a great performance in news online.", "So when you take that and put it to money, ad sales and pricing with clients is pretty good and profits were very good. So of course, you would rather take all those things and add to those benefits, even higher ratings and we will work on doing that, but there is a bit of a difference in what CNN tries to do as a news service on all of its platforms 24 hours a day versus what some of our \u201ccable news competitors\u201d try to do.", "At the end of the day we are interested, of course, in having a strong brand for the long-term and having it produce earnings more than ratings.", "John Martin", "If you go to entertainment, basically very strong success as I tried to describe in my upfront remarks on originals. Originals are a pretty important part of the branding and the future of all these networks as they move beyond the TV, then you dial into VOD international and TV everywhere and so forth, so that kind of success with key shows and franchises at TNT and TBS and even at the Adult Swim and truTV is very positive for the long run and shows that the management is focused on the right thing.", "One of the important drivers I think at least to these questions is acquired programming. It's a big part of a big reach cable network economics and so in a period like we had this fall where some of our acquired programming didn't work so well. And you may go out of money on acquired programming. So we're not totally hitting then you need to move the line up a little which we are doing. I don't think it\u2019s significant, I am not complacent about it, but we think we know how to fix it in the case of TBS which had (inaudible) didn't work as well as we thought it will take a little longer to rotate out but I don't think it's a \u201cstructural problem\u201d for the success at the Turner Network.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield of Pali Capital. Rich you may proceed.", "Rich Greenfield - Pali Capital", "Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on a few questions; one, looking at HBO, if you\u2019ve listened to the cable operators over the last several months, all of them are talking about the kind of a pervasive slow down in premium channel sales and whether that's HBO or Showtime or Star, I hear you on the RBOC side of growth, could you just comment on how the subscriber growth is so strong with kind of all of the multi-channel industry talking about the slowdown, where is the disconnect there, and is it mostly coming from price, et cetera, or they are actually growing HBO subs even while other subs fall off the cliff?", "And then the other question, John, you are talking about keeping CapEx relatively flat but yet CapEx I think was down almost 20% year-on-year, wondering what actually drove that CapEx decline of 20% and is there any reason why CapEx should be at the $500 million to $600 million level versus $400 million or $500 million. What's actually in there that's keeping that number even at that level, given the lack of capital intensity of your business? Thanks.", "Jeff Bewkes", "Good question, I think you had a lot of the answer in the question for HBO. Basically it was net growth overall when you count all the distributors, most of the growth was in telco, there are some strong cable MSO performances too, but there were some fairly under performing cable affiliates, I am not going to call them out, they know who they are, and they will probably decide that it\u2019s in their interest to start getting the benefits there our other distributors are getting out of focusing on premium.", "So basically, it\u2019s working at HBO in terms of subs. We haven't seen -- I think you have actually heard more chatter about premium softness, than has actually happened even in the cable side. Or if it\u2019s happened, it\u2019s happened to our competitors not to HBO.", "John Martin", "On the CapEx question, being down year-over-year didn't come naturally, it literally came from hard management and it is a level, a new level that we are going to measure our performance against going forward and that's the level that I am saying we ought to be able to keep as close to flat as possible.", "As far as what's in that number, and it's in $500 million, $600 million range, it's a lot of money being put towards technology. Remember at our Turner networks, we are supporting a global news gathering operation. And as Jeff said a 100 feeds reaching 200 countries, I mean it's a very, very big global business, and we also have capital each year that we set aside to support expansion in our businesses. We have to find places for people to sit, buildings and so on and so forth.", "But beyond that there isn't any one or two huge numbers, it\u2019s just comprised of a bunch of little things that add up. ", "Doug Shapiro", "Can we get the next question please?", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from Bernstein Research. Michael, you may proceed. ", "Michael Nathanson - Bernstein Research", "", "Thanks. I have a couple for John on advertising at Turner. John, in the past you have helped us to mention the change in growth rates between news entertainment and between domestic and international. I wonder if you could shed some light on what's going on between all those different buckets at Turner in fourth quarter.", "John Martin", "", "Sure. In the fourth quarter, as we said, we reported down 4%. The biggest contributor to the decline was in news and the biggest contributor there was in domestic news and that represented somewhere around half the decline. Domestic entertainment and kids taken together actually in the quarter was down very modestly, and there was somewhat of a moderation of the declines in international. Remember that through the first three quarters of the year, international was pacing behind where domestic was. International in part helped by FX rebounded a little bit in the fourth quarter was actually up a little bit. ", "Looking into the first quarter and again it\u2019s still early in the quarter, we caveat that, but as we said, we are seeing improved trends virtually across the board. ", "We're seeing, we think domestic entertainment is up. News is pacing much better although it's got a very difficult comparison with the Inauguration and International is pacing better as well. The one area that remains somewhat soft for us which we think is more of an industry trend than company specific is Kids, and we have been talking about that all year with you.", "But our Kid's business, a growing percentage of that business is really coming out from Adult Swim where we've been very successful in ratings and we are growing advertising there too. Do you want more on that?", "Michael Nathanson - Bernstein Research", "Yeah the only question was basically, Sports News is really hot, can you talk a bit about, what are seeing on the Sports level with NBA? Your sports advertising growth, how much of that is the driver?", "John Martin", "I'm not going to hit at the specifics of sports and advertise, but I would tell you the rating is terrific. I think season to date, NBA is up nicely year-over-year, we started off the season in a terrific position and we see this as being an area that is going to be highly attracted to advertisers and we are very optimistic about the business prospects this year in that area. ", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi of Standard & Poor's Equity Group. Tuna, you may proceed. ", "Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor's Equity Group", "I have two questions as well. So on the first one, it's regarding the windowing strategy, so I think Jeff, it's fair to say that Warner Brothers has been one of the most aggressive and in blazing its trail with some of the new technologies and strategies what I did their in VOD, or even the recent deal that you guys had with Netflix, so I think, kind of beg the question, why you still one of the studios still holding out with Redbox, do you have thoughts on thoughts on perhaps whether certain channels might be more cannibalistic as opposed to incremental and any current thought there would be helpful in terms of the overall strategy.", "And separately on the DC comics initiative it seems like you have a bunch of paddles in the [works] right now can you talk a little bit about the upcoming release strategy there I know you are working on Green Lantern then The Flash, Wonder, Justice League those titles any time frame and how you see the economics of the overall comics really this kind of affect in the studio margins as a whole and any multi platform implication would also be helpful for that area.", "Jeff Bewkes", "", "On the home video day and day VOD, Redbox networks all of that. Basically on VOD which is the highest yield in terms of margin of the convergence when you go up, sale DVD such better than that Watson Redbox. We essentially released all of our titles day and day on VOD in the United States 2009 that was point, it certainly was the reason that we ranked number one in VOD. What it didn't hurt us in terms of ranking number one in physical DVD sale ran off basically every category. So, we think that we are hopefully providing an example of what can work in putting out rational windows, we want to make our titles available to consumers in the highest quality earliest to windows most conveniently to them when they buy and they ran them on every means they buy physical they ran them electronically and so forth. And what we are doing is basically setting up all the appropriate ways to do that, taking the lowest margin approaches that would be something like very low price rental and putting it in window terms after the higher margin ones.", "We can't go in because of their litigation with Redbox; I can't really talk too much about what we are discussing with them. But as with all emerging platforms when there is TV fell in the publishing we want to provide consumers with the best choices and we want to do it in a way that gives us fair economics, I think its pretty clear as an example that the deal that Warner struck with Netflix which puts them into a win-win position and which also however allows the early window for higher margin distributors, it's a pretty good example of how this works when its working the right way.", "If you go to your question on DC, we are going to have a fairly interesting set of announcements and presentations pretty soon like in a matter of weeks I think. About our plans for DC and basically if you look across the title of the whole band of hits whether its Batman, The Dark Knight, Green Lantern coming up, Superman, there have been a huge number of franchised films that have been part of the Warner [tent pole] strategy that's been the reason for Warner's unparallel high and consistent earnings advantage over the other studios and DC has already been a part of that and we are now going to outline an even more expansive plan for that in the coming months.", "Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor's Equity Group", "Okay, I'll wait for that then. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank. Doug, you may proceed.", "Doug Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks just two questions, one Rupert said yesterday he was out of the MGM deal and he had no interest in Miramax so I am just wondering if Time Warner is the one that drove them out of the MGM deal and whether your interest is in film libraries and then separately, people are still obsessed with the concept of over-the-top video and I am just curious, do you see over the next few years for Turner and HBO starting to wholesale or retail those networks through online streaming. So not TV everywhere but rather supporting new Pay TV distributors like an Apple or Amazon and I guess how does HBO go sort of layer in with that. Thanks.", "", "Jeff Bewkes", "Yes, two things. First MGM and Miramax. We don't comment on potential deals and we feel comfortable with our strategic position and scale before considering anything like MGM or any of those other libraries. So we don't need to do anything. We'll just continue to be disciplined and opportunistic about these things. Any deal if we were to do one would need to provide strategic benefits and strong return in relation to other choices that we have and you'd have to figure risk in figuring out what any returns would be on an acquisition. ", "On the second question, I love that question, over-the-top, the people that are going to Over-the-Top with us and not really them and I think it's really important to emphasize and we have sent this in so many ways across our networks, our film division and our publishing company, that we're going to make our content available to consumers in the brands they love, the way they like to use them, in every manner of interactive and on demand method and in most cases, we're going to be doing that without incremental charges for makings those things available digital to our subscribers. ", "Now if you talk about new, I think you used the phrase digital distributors we love new distributors. The ones you mentioned are not distributors, they are device manufacturers and what we're very interested is harnessing every kind of distributor that can get our content to consumers and we think its great when people come up with new devices and screens on which our consumers and leaders and viewers can watch their favorite media, but if the are not distributors, they are not particularly powerful in the chain.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Alan Gould of Soleil Securities. Alan, you may proceed. ", "Alan Gould - Soleil Securities", "", "Jeff do you see interactive advertising by the MSOs and the distributors having any impact on you as a program or over the near term, meaning the next say three years?", "Jeff Bewkes", "", "Not much but we will commit.", "Doug Shapiro", "", "Well, (inaudible) hour so thank you very much for joining us and we'll talk to you next time.", "Operator", "This concludes today's Time Warner's fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks and good morning. This morning, we issued two press releases. One, detailing our results for the second quarter and the other, updating our 2010 full year business outlook. Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover.", "First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, schedules setting out reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included on our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site. ", "And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ", "Thank you, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. We just completed another very strong quarter, capping off a good first half of the year. ", "Our revenue grew 8%, and that's our highest rate in two years, with advertising revenue up 11%, its highest rate in almost six years. Adjusted operating income rose 15%, and our adjusted earnings per share climbed 35%. ", "As you saw in this morning's release, we've raised our outlook for the year. We now expect adjusted EPS to increase at least 20% in 2010, up from our prior guidance of at least mid-teens growth. And please keep in mind that, that's after growing adjusted EPS by 29% last year. ", "Our results this year have benefited from an improved ad environment, from our continued cost controls and more than anything else, the appeal of our content and the strength of our brands. As I've told you before, one of our key objectives is to leverage our scale and brands, to invest in and create the highest-quality concept. That, in turn, strengthens  our brands, attracts audiences and increases our scale. It's a virtuous circle and a key competitive advantage for Time Warner. Across the company this quarter, you can see our commitment to this strategy, and you can see the payoff. I'll start with our Networks.", "There's no doubt that the quality of Turner's content and the appeal of its brands helped drive its 14% advertising growth this quarter, and that's the highest in years. Discounted market was healthy in the quarter, which helped our performance. But our advertising growth was so strong, in large part because advertisers increasingly want to associate their brands and products with ours. Our success at this year's upfront also showed the appeal of our content and brands. ", "Turner's Entertainment Networks (sic) [Turner Entertainment Networks] led both their broadcast and cable competitors in pricing gains. And they increased volumes by double digits. In particular, we saw extremely strong demand for Conan O'Brien. In fact, we were able to achieve parity with the broadcast EPS for the show. ", "Also, we're especially encouraged by the performance of truTV. As you know, tru recently broke into the ranks of top 10 cable networks. In the second quarter, it delivered more adults, 18 to 49, than MTV, Spike, Sci-fi and Lifetime. And tru was treated like a top 10 network at the upfront, achieving CPM increases comparable with our other large entertainment networks for the first time. ", "So advertisers are recognizing the growing value of our programming and brands. We're confident that our affiliates will also recognize this increasing value over time. As we head into the back half of the year, we're feeling very confident about Turner's slate of original programming. One of our new shows, Memphis Beat, premiered in June as the top-rated new cable series of the quarter. ", "And last month, in July, another new series, Rizzoli & Isles, launched as the highest-rated, ad-supported premier in the history of cable. And we just brought back The Closer, which remains the number one show week-after-week on cable, and it's up over last year. Other hit shows returning in the next couple of months included Dark Blue, which is premiering tonight, and Ray Romano's, Men of a Certain Age, which is coming back in the fall. And then, of course, we'll launch Conan's show in November. ", "This team focused on content and brand as the driving force at HBO. As you know, HBO not only has the best slate of recently released movies, but it also has the best original programming on TV. Just a few weeks ago, for example, HBO received 101 Emmy nominations, the most in any network for the 10th year in a row. Viewers agree with the critics. ", "For instance, we recently debuted the third season of True Blood to a 40% bigger audience than last season's premier. It's now averaging about 13 million viewers per episode, rivaling the final season of The Sopranos. HBO subscribers love our unmatched selection of movies as much as ever. But our consumer research shows that original programming is an increasingly important factor in their decision to subscribe. We're working hard to build on this momentum with more new series in development now than in anytime in HBO's history. ", "Next month, we'll debut Boardwalk Empire, produced by Martin Scorsese, which we think will be HBO's next breakout hit. And we just greenlit Luck, that's a provocative look at horse race from Michael Mann and David Milch and starring Dustin Hoffman and Nick Nolte.", "Turning from HBO to our Studio. Last week, Warner Bros. became the first studio to cross the $1 billion market, the domestic box office for the 10th year in a row, another validation of our strategy. And we'd expect to extend this success with a strong slate in the second half and next year. ", "We're off to a great start. Our seller blockbuster, Inception, has led the domestic box office for three straight weeks, and is easily on track to exceed $0.5 million of the global box office. Another major releases planned for the rest of the year include: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part I; Legends of the Guardians from Zack Snyder, who gave you 300; Bill Gates from the writer and director of Hangover, Todd Phillips; Hereafter from Clint Eastwood; Life As We Know It with Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel; and Yogi Bear in 3D.", "As we outlined in our recent Investor Day, we plan to release six event films again next year in 2011 including: Green Lantern, The Hangover 2, Happy Feet 2, The Next Sherlock Holmes, and last, but not least, the final in the Harry Potter series. ", "Warner's Television Production business again delivered an industry-leading upfront with orders for 15 returning series and 11 new series from the broadcast networks. That makes us the number one provider of network TV programming for the fourth time in the past five years. And we're experiencing extremely strong demand for our products in the syndication market. ", "We saw very competitive bidding and a record price for the off-network rights to The Big Bang Theory in May. And that was coming on the heels of last year's record sale of  The Mentalist. Demand for these shows is a great indicator about the value of our syndication pipeline over the next couple of years.  ", "Time Inc. is also outperforming its competitors. Again, a testament to the strength of its brands and to its editorial content. Time Inc. widens its industry leadership and advertising revenue during the first half of the year, gaining more share than any other publisher. And the growth was broad-based, with 15 of our top 20 titles showing increases. ", "Looking ahead, these brands will continue to lead the industry as it expands into evolving digital platforms such as tablets, and the richer online environments that is enabled by HTML files. I hope you've had a chance to see the TIME, Sports Illustrated, FORTUNE and Entertainment Weekly apps for the iPad. ", "Overtime, and very shortly, we anticipate that our subscribers will be able to enjoy the same amazing experience on every tablet. So in short, we're committing more resources than ever to strengthening our content and our brands. It's paying off in our results. And it's a big part of the reason why I'm so confident about how we're positioned for the rest of this year and the years after that. ", "And so with that, I'll pass it off to John Martin.", "John Martin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. There are slides that are now available on our website that will follow along with my comments. And let's begin, by the way, on the first slide, where there were a few high-level takeaways from the quarter. ", "As we discussed with you before, our goal is to deliver superior shareholder returns through a combination of operational growth and direct returns of capital. In this quarter, we continue to execute on that plan. As Jeff described, we delivered our fastest revenue growth in two years, led in large part by the strength of our content. ", "At the same time, we remain focused on operational efficiencies, which enabled us to grow both adjusted operating income and EPS at considerably faster rates than revenue. Our performance so far this year had given us the confidence to raise our full year outlook again. Growing at least 20% this year comes on top, as Jeff said, on top of the 29% adjusted EPS growth in 2009, think about that we're on track to deliver north of 50% adjusted EPS growth in just the last two years. ", "Of course, this is in the face of what has been clearly an extremely challenging recession and what continues to be somewhat of an uncertain recovery.", "Turning to capital appointment for a moment. Our free cash flow generation in the first half, as well as some recent refinancings that we've done, have further strengthened our balance sheet and we've used some of its flexibility to increase our return to capital. We've spent over $1.5 billion on dividend and share repurchases during the first half of the year, and that's more than twice the level of what we returned in the first half of last year.", "Moving to the next slide, which shows consolidated second quarter financial highlights. Revenues were up 8% with Subscription, Advertising and Content revenues all up over last year. Advertising was particularly strong, increasing 11% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was up over 15%, with margins increasing 120 basis points year-over-year. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. ", "And as we've talked to you before, we continue to try to get the keep a lid on SG&A, where we can so that we can reallocate resources toward more productive areas like Programming, TV and Film Production and Marketing. ", "Continuing to lock down the P&L, we grew adjusted EPS by 35%.  And these strong results was helped by our operational growth, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count as compared to last year.", "Turning now to the segment highlights, and let me begin with our Networks, where we achieved another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth.", "Advertising revenues here were up 14%. We're still above 10% if you eliminate the impact of international transactions, and this performance was driven by growth across our networks. Our Domestic Networks continue to benefit from strong scattered demand, with pricing up 20% to 30% in the quarter, as well as ongoing yield management. ", "Gaming Networks including kids and young adults grew advertising in the high-single digits. And there was a high demand for the NBA playoffs on TNT, despite four fewer games than last year due to shorter series. And domestic news posted double-digit year-over-year advertising growth. ", "At our International Networks, organic advertising growth was more than 30%. And I'd also point out that adjusted operating income for our consolidated International Network businesses grew by more than 50% in the quarter. And we achieved a 200 basis points of margin expansion here year-over-year. ", "Looking ahead, domestic scatter pricing remains robust and it's still up more than 20% over the upfront. And trends internationally look relatively consistent with the second quarter. So, while it may be difficult for us to maintain quite the pace of this quarter's growth, we do expect another quarter of strong advertising growth in the third quarter. So we feel pretty good about that. ", "Subscription revenue growth here of 9% primarily reflected higher rates and international expansion. Remember, that this is a very big revenue stream for us and we continue to receive Subscription revenues as being one of the largest growth opportunities for the company. We are continually investing to increase the value of our networks through our viewers and distributors, and we expect this value to be recognized over time in our affiliate views. ", "Operating income was up 14% in the quarter and margins expanded approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with our plan, both marketing and programming costs grew more quickly in the second quarter than in the first quarter and that was tied to the timing of new and original programming. As you know, increased investment in originals is a key element in our strategic plan for both Turner and HBO, and we have a particularly strong lineup of originals running during the third quarter, and it's the shows that Jeff mentioned just a few minutes ago. And those include both returning and new shows, shows such as The Closer and Leverage on TNT, a new series Are We There Yet? on TBS, Rizzoli & Isles and Memphis Speed on TNT and Boardwalk Empire on HBO to name a few. ", "Due to this large slate of originals, we expect our third quarter margins to compress somewhat compared to last year's third quarter, but they should once again expand in the fourth quarter. And for the year, we continue to expect relatively modest programming cost growth in and around the mid-single-digit area. So given strong topline performance to date and encouraging trends that we've experienced, we think that this will all translate into very strong profit growth at our Networks division this year.", "Let's turn now to Film. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was relatively flat, but it's still up significantly year-to-date and we saw significant increases in both the optical and television revenue in the quarter, but we also have higher film costs and P&A due to a larger number of high-budget theatrical films and the shift towards international sales distribution for new line releases. ", "In addition, a greater percentage of our television revenue came from lower margin new series. Overtime, we're confident we can continue to push margins higher at this division by focusing on operational efficiencies and accelerating the transition to digital consumption, particularly in home video.", "Our Home Video revenue was down 8% year-over-year in the quarter, but that was mostly a function of a previously disclosed return-reserve adjustment, which helped last year's results. Industry trends have shown some improvement in recent months, with home video sales for the industry close to flat in the second quarter. And digital growth remained quite strong. Warner Bros. grew video and electronic sell-through over 50%. And on a combined basis, these revenues are now quickly approaching 20% of our total Home Video business. As you know, that revenue have a much higher margin attached to it so that's both important and encouraging. ", "So let's continue to move ahead and look at free cash flow for a minute on the next slide. Year-to-date, we've generated about $1.2 billion of free cash flow. That's down a little year-over-year due to primarily higher cash taxes and an increase in accounts receivable tied to higher revenue growth. However, it still represents a meaningful amount of free cash flow and a high conversion ratio. So let's move to our final slide, which looks at net debt.", "We ended the quarter with a little more than $12 billion in net debt, and that's up about $800 million compared to the end of last year. And that's a result of us spending more than 100% of our free cash flow year-to-date, or about $1.5 billion on share repurchases and dividends. And we've also spent about $0.5 billion year-to-date on acquisitions, and about 80% of the acquisitions have been on international cable networks, with the majority of that related to our acquisition of additional interests in HBO's international operations. It also includes our acquisition of Turbine, which is an online gaming studio, to further enhance Warner Bros.' capabilities in the video game space. So with half the year now complete, we're on track to achieve our capital plan priorities and objectives. ", "So let me remind you quickly what those are. First, we're going to continue to invest in our businesses to improve the strategic position and drive long-term growth, and that's evidenced by the increased investment in programming production and marketing that we've talked to you about. ", "Second, we're committed to providing direct returns to stockholders through dividends and buybacks, and as I previously mentioned in the first half of the year, we spent $1.5 billion, including about $1 billion in share repurchases. And we still have about $2 billion outstanding under our current share repurchase authorization. ", "Third, we're focused on our capital structure and carefully managing debt maturities. This year, for example, we've taken full advantage of the current credit markets to effectively extend the maturities of $5 billion in debt, including $3 billion just last month. This has allowed us to improve our maturity profile at very, very attractive interest rates. We now have no more than $1 billion in debt coming due in any year through the end of the decade, so that's good.  We consider this strategic flexibility that we have to be a real competitive advantage. ", "Our leverage ratio is now about 2x, and that's somewhat closer to our long-term target of 2.5x, but yet still leaves us with plenty of flexibility. So thanks for listening, and let me turn the call back over to Doug to start the Q&A part of the call.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks. Let's get the Q&A started. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "On the home video market improving, is there any measurable benefit from the Netflix and Redbox yields, where you pushed back their home video window? Now that was for the second quarter and maybe there's more experience there and that was part of it. And then separately, Jeff, you mentioned affiliates will recognize increasing value over time, and John emphasized it as well. Can you help us out with the timing part of that increasing value over time? I mean, typically these deals are five years or so, so a fifth comes up every year. Is that the layout, which you just expect 20% of the deals a year? Or is there a bigger year in '11 or '12 that we should think about?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Basically, the results from the Netflix-Redbox window moving back has been quite good. As I think you all know, the intent of the move of the window is to boost demand for DVD sell-through and for VOD. And while it's early, as the results indicate, but that strategy is working quite well particularly, on big titles. Two that I would cite, which are the biggest ones since we moved there, Blind Side is one and Sherlock Holmes is another. We saw considerably higher sales and the weeks, say two to four that we used to see in that kind of week-by-week distribution of sales. The joint cable and studio marketing program to promote Video-on-Demand helped. And one other thing that, I think, we're going to see as we move along, you still have a fair amount of upside room for activity and effort in VOD. The VOD marketing effort, the kind of ability that cable, satellite, telco infrastructure to do VOD is still increasing pretty fast. And so we think that this is working already and it's going to work better as we go along. We have seen other studios following that plan in terms of that window. And we've seen the titles that come from studios that are not using that window structure underperform. So that's what we know so far on those windows. In terms of the affiliate fee, we are extremely confident of our outlook for affiliate fee growth. Obviously, in the premise of your question, the majority of what the revenue that we have is under multiyear contracts, and it's not quite right to say that it rolls over at the rate linearly that you were saying. I'm sorry, I'm not going to give exactly the timing of our maturity. But as you've been watching what we've been doing, not just this Turner, [indiscernible] its original programming success, which we mentioned in our prepared remarks, but also the big programming deals, whether it's for the sports, the basketball, Conan deal, some of the strength of new shows at HBO. We really think that we're improving our position in our future outlook on the affiliate side.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "Are you willing to say at all, whether we'll start to see some of those benefits soon? Or should we think about that as a long-term driver?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Soon.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "One question for Jeff and one for John. For Jeff, just to follow up on Doug's question, can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about Netflix since it's a customer of Warner Bros., but also potentially, a competitor to HBO? And then for John, could you just update us on your thoughts on capital allocation in terms of potentially accelerating returns of capital to shareholders versus potential acquisitions like say, MGM?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "On Netflix, you're quite right. It's a customer for our output and it is a potential competitor to Networks like HBO. Although, so far, it's been more of a complementary service to HBO than a competitor. So one thing I would tell all of you is to actually look at that and any of these companies, Netflix not being the only one, we are quite organized at the job [ph] between Warner and HBO and Turner, how we look at those. And so what you see us doing is something that comes out of a fairly coordinated approach. In terms of HBO's view, we at HBO is very used to competition, and does it by providing a great product, which you can focus either on a superior movie supply that they've got, that got us major releases out many year, or on the original programming, which is unique to HBO. Really, in both respects, both the movies, the Hollywood movies and the originals are unique to HBO and exclusive when you're on HBO. Where Netflix has gone essentially, everywhere Netflix has sub [ph], HBO out-indexed it in terms of its penetration, retention and performance. As you look into the future, I'm not going to really clarify exactly how the programming strategy will work over time. But suffice it to say, I feel very good about that, both on the movie side and the original programming side. And I really would call everyone's attention to what you're about to see, and you already see it with our biggest distributors, Verizon and Comcast, which is HBO On Demand, not only on your TV set, which is already a huge success in ratings and in competitive relative position for HBO versus all other networks. But you're still going to see HBO on all your broadband devices because you're a subscriber to HBO. And if you take the show lineup that HBO's got on originals and movies and you put it available On Demand on all broadband devices, which you're already seeing at Comcast and Verizon, that's going to be the big news for this next year.", "John Martin", "Spencer, on capital allocation, we don't have a specific target level for our returns. But I think our actions would suggest that we clearly believe that direct returns to shareholders should be a significant component of total return. And it's an important part of our capital plan, and we continue to believe in a balanced, consistent approach, and we believe in using a combination of dividends and share repurchases. And obviously, our share repurchase activities suggest that we have a lot of confidence in the value of the stock and the company. So we've been repurchasing shares around $500 million a quarter. We did raise our dividend 13% this year. And as I mentioned in my proactive remarks, our returns on a year-to-date basis are basically at double the levels they were a year ago. I don't know, Jeff, if you want to make a comment specific about MGM?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Yes, I do. From what we read in the papers, it sounds like we're moving in a different direction and it sounds pretty inept to us. All along, we've said that we didn't need this. We feel comfortable, of course, with our strategic positioning. And MGM could have made attach [ph] when we went, and as everyone knows, because we announced it before they did, we made what we thought was a bid based on what information we had at the time. We haven't really had the kind of discussions that would enable us to confirm whatever the value of MGM is because you just have to go into a more constructive process than has been the move [ph] we've been invited into, and so I don't know. We don't know whether that is in fact worth the full bid that we gave it at the time. And at this point, it does look like they're going off in another direction. We'll see how they do. I think it's pretty widely known that some of their key movie assets, one, which is The Hobbit is something that we may be quite involved in. And so we have an interest in them having some constructive course going forward. But it's not clear whether they do have that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morris from Davenport.", "Michael Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC", "First, as some of your broadcast competitors are becoming more vocal and more active in generating retransmission fees to their owned and operating stations, can you just share what your outlook is for the competitive environment for content going forward, whether you anticipate that they'll become more aggressive, both as competitors, also maybe in terms of demand for Warner Bros. content? What's your expectation there, and how are you positioning yourself? And then on the Syndication side, you mentioned robust Syndication pipeline in the back half of the year. Can you be a little more specific with respect to what's in that pipeline? And as a point of clarification, you did have a slide on your Investor Day, in the Warner Bros. section, showing some titles coming up in 2010. It included Entourage and Curb Your Enthusiasm. I was curious, do they make a contribution to Warner as well as HBO? Or will that completely be in HBO?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Starting with -- what was the first question? Retran, okay. We think the retran situation is developing in the way we actually thought it would. I mean, we think it's, on whole, desirable. We do think broadcasters as competitors of our Cable Networks. They've always received a form of retran, usually not in cash for the broadcast network, but in other kind of ancillary networks. And so to the extent that as they get it more direct on their broadcast network and to the extent that they get additional cash, we still think that the stronger cable network, which will be the group we're at, will prosper as they, in the broadcast side, spoke their economics. We think that all our Networks are multi-task [ph] networks with multi-task [ph] programming. The originals, part of that. [indiscernible], the movie line ups as well. So we're actually kind of happy that broadcast has revitalized their programming because there's really two reasons. The easy one to see is that we have a very healthy leading business at Warner, making TV series for the broadcast networks and then bolstering their health going forward is actually good for that business. But the second fact that was related to that is that the successful shows that come off broadcast networks, many of which we made at Warner, are then available for the leading cable networks like TNT and TBS. And they're pretty important part of the ecosystem. And as we've said before, that kind of synergy relationship in terms of Warner supplying hit shows, broadcast across all broadcasts nets, and then having those hits shows available to the highest bidding cable network, which happened to be ours, due to their lead position, is a very beneficial kind of a cycle for the industry and for us. If you go now to the Syndication question, we think that, I think John mentioned in the second quarter, the sale of The Closer to TNT was already in there. It's not that large. We think the pipeline is very strong for the rest of the year. For the rest of this year, we have Two and a Half Men for cable. We have The Closer coming for cable, and we can broadcast. We have The New Adventures of Old Christine. And then looking after 2010, into next year, we've already sold Big Bang Theory for 2011 and The Mentalist for 2012. We've got Gossip Girl and Chuck coming in 2011.  Fringe is available in 2012. And the shows you mentioned on HBO, Entourage...", "John Martin", "Yes, Entourage and Curb, which from an accounting standpoint, that gets reflected in HBO's line of business. The DVD sales get distributed by Warner's but the Syndication licensing is of HBO.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "John, with a lot of the conversation around growing demand for TV Syndication content, I'm just wondering if structurally, as you smooth out your Filmed Entertainment division over time, is the composition of revenues and EBITDA from TV versus Film changing over time? I know you don't report them separately within Filmed Entertainment, but just wondering.", "John Martin", "We don't report them separately, Anthony. And one of the strength of Warner's and one of the reasons why they're probably less volatile than most of the competition, in terms of earnings performance is because we have a very, very big and very, very stable source of profits from our TV Production business, which includes licensing, syndication, border and its global. And I think we had mentioned that with the growing Syndication pipeline, that we would expect to see growth on a go-forward basis from that Television business beginning this year. And so I mean, the mix, sort of, can go up and down at any one particular year, but we have a very, very big component of profits coming from each of the Theatrical and the Television side. And I think we've disclosed in the past that TV, in any given year, can represent nearly half of the profitability of Warner's. And I think it's a strong business, I think secular trends are moving in its direction, which is good, and we expect to be very successful going forward.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "And a related question for Jeff, which would be the deal that Warner Bros. announced with Netflix on TV content. I just thought I would ask, on the face of it, this looks like a really good deal because it seems like these are incremental dollars that are flowing to WB for TV content. I'm just wondering if there's a trade-off between these dollars from Netflix that you're getting and the value that you're accruing in the syndication window that you're speaking of? And I know those are not exclusive deals, but I'm just wondering, is there a balance that your syndication division has passed away, in terms of whether or not the deal with Netflix trades off with the deals for TV Syndication and domestic market?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Yes, well, we always look when we're scouting a product in a window. I won't say to it anybody, in this case, Netflix, of whether it conflicts with anything that's more interesting to us. In this case, what we're talking about is a fairly small deal with some programming Nip/Tuck series, which wasn't picked up in syndication. So frankly, had there been anybody buying it in syndication, we would've sold it to the syndication market. The same is true. There was a small movie package in there that's quite old movies, which is really the kind of movies Netflix has. So basically, we don't see so far, and we haven't seen too many other cases where other companies have sold things to Netflix, but essentially, there are a few where it cannibalizes  business that's actually better than what Netflix was able to represent. And we basically traded a lot, whether it's with our current networks or with our syndicated files. And remember that the syndication market, generally, is very, very strong, which I think John mentioned. And so what you're talking about here is the only product that nobody wants.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet. [Citigroup]", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Inc", "Definitive decision on HBO GO to make that only exclusive to existing HBO customers, your Pay TV distributors as opposed to...", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Jason, would you start over? We didn't hear anything for 10 seconds. We've had, like, long lapses of silence on our side. So we apologize, but if you could start the question over, that would be helpful.", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Inc", "I have two questions on HBO GO. Have you made a definitive decision to limit the availability of HBO Online, if you will, to existing customers of HBO via the Pay TV distributors as opposed to making it available to non-HBO subs over the web? And second, have you made a definitive decision regarding the content that would be available online? In other words, is it only the content that's available on the multiplex channels of HBO as opposed to the deeper library content that you have access to?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Let me do the second part first. HBO GO, as you can all read in the press releases, we'll have to give you more [indiscernible] give it to you. HBO has considerably more products from HBO -- HBO GO's programming from HBO is even more programming than what is available -- so HBO GO's programming from HBO is even more hours, considerably more than what is available on HBO VOD. And so that's how substantial and more and it's quite a bit more. So it's going to be a very impressive product. I do think over time what you'll see on the VOD side, the television streaming side is a more robust product as the Cable, Sat, Telco operators beef up their VOD, but basically think of it as eventually, as much as what it has coming to you as a subscriber, go to your first question, which is what are we doing with subscribers? At the present time, what we're doing is, we basically are launching HBO to our subscriber base. You have 30 million subs that deserve to get HBO On Demand on every platform, including on broadband. You paid for it, you should have it. And we're going to have our distributors, who are very important partners in doing this and putting up the plant that allows you to do this, be part of the equation. The question of whether we should that bask in the future, offer a subscription separately from that, is not something that we're ready to do now. Of course, we could do it, if and when it would become reasonable, but the one thing that we're quite interested in -- and I think every content company should be, is in supporting the economic infrastructure of video streaming, video delivery and broadband ISP delivery. Because if you think carefully about the broadband-video distribution infrastructure, it needs to become more robust. It needs investment and the companies that do that are the ISPs. So you have to think carefully about keeping those economics related as you take products like HBO, Turner Network and you make them available on broadband devices. So I think we're working quite progressively to have the whole system function optimally. And the key to it all is to get our subscribers, not just for our TV Networks, but on ad events to be able to enjoy their products overall all these devices as soon as possible because they already subscribed.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Dix from Wedbush.", "James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "If you can give any more color on the outlook for growth at WB and Proactive Entertainment, especially with the strong performance of LEGO titles. I mean, do you have a sense that the games division is somewhat outperforming your expectations for the beginning of the year? And then, secondly, on costs, I was just wondering if you can give any more color on the increase in SG&A in the quarter at the networks? Were there any components to that growth related to acquisitions, or any stuff that's not organic? And what's your expectations be for that growth for the full year there of the networks?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "On games at Warner, we're basically now up to more than $0.5 billion in revenue and growing reasonably fast with healthy margins. And we're really doing two things: We've brought in some, in terms of acquisition, we brought in some companies like Midway, Rocksteady, [indiscernible] et cetera. It's bringing us IP. It's bringing us titles like the Lord of the Rings, Arkham Asylum, Mortal Kombat. And then secondly, we have, as you all know, a pretty big titles in our IP inventory in the Warner and Time Warner Characters in some strategy. So we're essentially building from our position of both distribution related to DVD and all that, and IP that we have in our programming. And we're working towards the global video infrastructure, which goes adjacent in gains. So we think that we're making steady progress. We've moved into the top 10. We see it a growing percentage of the Warner Bros. 'revenues. It's actually one of the fairly high growth areas inside Warner Bros., and we believe the margins should improve as we increase our sales and further leverage the infrastructure.", "John Martin", "On the cost side, I think your question was specific to Networks SG&A. One of the bigger year-over-year increases in SG&A in the quarter was marketing. And marketing around, obviously, supporting new programming launches. So that's one of the more meaningful components of that. And just to put a little bit more context around it, this is the sixth quarter in a row where we had a year-over-year margin expansion at the networks division. And I think if you look at the absolute margin in networks in the second quarter and if you go and compare that to history of the second quarters of all the prior years, I think it's the highest margin at the Networks for as long as our data goes back for. So my point being is that we are carefully managing the investment in the cost space. We are trying to be more efficient where we can, and I often mentioned that we're trying to keep a lid on SG&A, but marketing is a component of that. That is directly tied to revenues because of supporting the investment that we're making our programming. So we're working hard and we continue to see positive margin attributes as we go forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield from BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "Can you comment on your thoughts related to the actual pricing? Jeff, if you went down to the AMC Lincoln Square right near your offices, you would pay $13 to see Inception. You would pay $17 for Cats and Dogs 3D, just wondering how you think about that, and whether that makes sense from a pricing standpoint? And then two, you talked a lot about HBO GO. There's been a lot of questions about it. I'm just wondering, your deal with Comcast forces everything in broadband to go through their Fancast interface which seems, at least from consumers I've talked to, to be vastly inferior to your beautiful HBO GO interface, and just wondering whether that will change going forward or whether that's something that's set in stone forever?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "On the pricing, I'm not sure if I get your question. I mean, it's a long-standing question about whether the ticket priced for movies that people think are being hit, should be the same as the ticket price from let's say, are controversial as to whether they're hits. And I believe you mentioned what could fall into that category. And then your related question is what do you think of the GAAP between 3D pricing and regular pricing. Revenues in theatrical box office has been reasonably healthy. Admissions, have stayed flat. I don't think the industry, meaning the distribution retail field industry, they don't believe really believe that the it's all about elastic in terms of volume of ignitions. It's ticket prices. And I think they believe that the place to have some kind of revenue growth to keep inflation is on ticket pricing, whether it's for standard stuff or whether it's for 3D. It's clear that 3D represents a bit of an opportunity for higher ticket prices and that probably will remain a question of legitimate interest as to whether this title in 3D justifies whatever that ticket price is versus some other type of 3D. And I think it really gets down to the whole issue of ticket pricing, whether it's standard or 3D experience. The fact that it's been standard across really good titles versus weaker titles is the source of the question. I think the question will remain and I think even I can't answer it satisfactorily that the fruit is in the eating of the pudding. Revenues in theatrical are quite healthy. And one of the things I wouldn't underestimate is that in the help of the box office, even coming from 3D price before, what does that is it develops a real interest for ancillary viewing, whether you actually see the movie in your home on a standard basis or you may watch it a theater on 3D or in the future maybe you'd get a 3D for your home viewing. So I think its all positive in terms of the industry on the film economics, at least for the producing sector. If you go-to-go and you're flying on Comcast or on the view on -- I agree with you on something. I agree with you on actually a lot of what you're seeing here. I think the interface for HBO GO, the HBO develop is superior to, basically, any interface outfits. And so we are encouraging everyone, all our affiliates, whoever they are, to take advantage of that interface and use it, which they could. I think that what will happen is any distributor who has an interface, who's really not able to perform as well as what the HBO one does, you can end up adopting it. And if your question basically asks, okay; that's what; your question has with the premise shouldn't they, do that quickly? I agree with you, yes, they should.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom Egan. [Collins Stewart]", "Thomas Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC", "Just a question on international cable networks, I guess if you provide maybe some more color, if I missed it, I apologize. But on the top line, on results and then on the outlook, how much of it is coming from increases in ad spending same store, so to speak, and how much of it's coming from expansion, whether it's new channels or new markets? And then on the margin, what was the actual margin on the international side and how high can that go?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "I mean, as we discussed in some detail on Investor Day, international is now and is going to continue to be a key driver of growth, including our unconsolidated HBO branches. Our International Cables Networks business had very close, very constant sales, generates over $400 million of adjusted operating income just in year 2010. And we think that there's tremendous growth going on, both in ad side and the affiliate side. In both Turner and HBO International, it's growing faster than domestic. I will just emphasize before John gives some of the numbers on it, we do not have a plant-the-flag strategy. What we have is a strategy where we try to identify the right growth markets for secular growth demographics on our attractiveness, rule of law hospitality to what we're doing, and an ability to build through a reasonable scale, so we can have good marketing, distribution efficiency and reasonable infrastructure decisions.", "John Martin", "I'll just add a couple of numbers. Our international reported growth was north of 80%, but that did include the impact of some acquisitions, which I said, which sort of contributed close to 400 basis points in the quarter. On an organic basis year-over-year, International was still up over 30%. And there, if you look at back at last year, International underperformed Domestic. And we've seen a stronger recovery in almost all territories where we've got meaningful presence as it relates to advertising. So that's very, very encouraging. We don't specifically disclose the absolute margins, but in my proactive remarks, I mentioned that margins were up 200 basis points year-over-year and we have said in the past that international margins are still meaningfully lagging our domestic margins. So we think we've got one way for improvement as we move ahead.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks, everybody for tuning in and we look forward to talking to you in a couple of months.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

My name is Keith, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Doug Shapiro, SVP, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks a lot. This morning, we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter and the other updating our 2010 full year business outlook. Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover.", "First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, schedules setting out reconciliations of these historical non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's on our site.", "And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors.", "These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Thank you, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug. Thanks, everyone, for listening this morning. We had another strong quarter, and we're on track for another terrific year. More important, we're positioning ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities that digital distribution will bring. This quarter, Turner, again, posed a double-digit advertising growth. We're continuing to benefit from strong demand for our inventory on TNT and TBS. And while we have ratings challenges at CNN that we are addressing, we've had solid ratings growth at several of our other Networks, including truTV, Turner and Adult Swim.", "We saw outstanding results from our most important new content this quarter. On TNT, our new show, Rizzoli & Isles, became the number one original series of all time on ad-supported Cable. On HBO, Boardwalk Empire is on track to become the most watched first year series in the network's history.", "At Warner Bros, our blockbuster movie, Inception, generated over $800 million at the global box office, and we're having a great start to new television season. In addition to the success of our returning shows like Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and The Mentalist, a new show, Mike & Molly, is the number one new comedy on TV.", "Looking forward, we expect improved ratings performance at our biggest entertainment Networks in the fourth quarter, driven by our strong lineup of original, the debut of Conan's new show next Monday and outstanding recent performance from our sports program. In fact, our coverage of the Major League Baseball American League championship series was the most watched league championship ever on TBS. And NBA Opening Night was the most watched regular season NBA game ever on Cable TV. This should enable us to continue capitalize on the solid demand in the scatter market, with pricing up 15% to 20% over the healthy prices that we saw in the 2010, 2011 upfront.", "And we're excited about the films that we're premiering this month. As you all know, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows opens in a few weeks. And just this weekend, we're opening Due Date from the Hangover Director, Todd Phillips, which could be another sleeper hit. All that momentum gives us the confidence to, again, raise our full year outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to grow at a rate in the high 20s over 2009. And last year was a year when we grew adjusted earnings per share by 29%.", "John will walk you through the results in detail in a few minutes. But overall, it's shaping up to be another very good year. I'd like to shift gears now and update you on a bigger picture issue that has made plenty of headlines in the way and that's the impact of digital distribution on our businesses. Clearly, digital distribution present some new challenges for the industry, but we believe that the opportunities significantly outweigh the risks. The unequivocal good news is that digital distribution offers consumers a better experience, with more choice, more convenience and more control. As a result, there's more demand than ever for the kind of high-quality content that we make, and it's a testament to that demand that so many companies are devoting so many resources to finding new ways to distribute and monetize our films and our TV shows and magazines.", "The question, of course, is how do we take advantage of these opportunities in a way that both enhances the consumer experience and enhances our economics. First, we're supporting an array of Networks to allow consumers to access Time Warner content on whatever device they want, wherever and whenever they want in a way that's attractive and convenient for them and economically beneficial for us. In other words, buy our content once and use it in multiple places. Think of it as content everywhere. I'll talk more about this idea in a moment.", "And second, we're experimenting with new business models that enable consumers to use and access our content in ways they couldn't before. As just one example of that, we will help lead the industry to launch a premium video-on-demand service that will enable consumers to watch recently released theatrical movies at home in high definition and eventually, in 3D. We're near agreement with our distributors on the right window and the right price point, and we expect to start offering our movies this way nationwide by the second quarter of next year.", "Let me come back to this idea of content everywhere. It means something slightly different in TV, film and magazine, so I'd like to touch on each of those. In TV Networks and production, it means TV Everywhere. And as you know, TV Everywhere is a framework to provide TV subscribers with a huge array of TV content, everything on the dial and have it on demand on a wide variety of devices for television, the PC, tablets, mobile devices at no extra charge. TV Everywhere promises to give consumers that flexibility while also bolstering an ecosystem that has produced such high-quality programs and so much choice.", "A year ago, there was vibrant debate about whether free was a good business model. TV Everywhere was just a concept, and many argued that it wouldn't work. So where are we now? TV Everywhere has made tremendous progress in a very short period of time. Today, there is widespread acknowledgment among content providers that free ad-supported websites cannot replace powerful dual revenue stream business models. But it's being adopted across the industry faster than anyone expected.", "Every major programmer has announced plans to participate. CBS, Discovery, Disney, Liberty, NBC Universal, News Corp, Scripts, Viacom, among others. As one important step, just last week, Disney launched authenticated versions of ESPN and ESPN 3  in most Time Warner Cable markets. In the last few weeks, we've launched TV Everywhere versions of TNT and TBS across the entire footprints of both Comcast and Dish, and we have many more announcements pending.", "We also have several deals pending for HBO GO and MAX GO, and now expect the services to be accessible to the vast majority of our HBO-Cinemax subscribers within a few months. In fact, some form of TV Everywhere is now available to over 50 million homes, and we expect it will be available to 70 million by the second quarter of next year. That's six months ahead of plan.", "In Film, content everywhere means enabling consumers to buy a movie once and then access it everywhere on a wide variety of devices. As we talked about with you before, digital is good for the Home Entertainment business. It's more convenient for consumers, and it generates higher gross profits for us. Video-on-demand movie rentals have been growing at a rapid rate recently but so far, electronic sales have lagged. The problem is it just isn't convenient for consumers to buy digital movies and then try to watch them on their TVs and move them from device to device. So we're leading the industry on several initiatives that seek to change that by improving the buying experience and expanding the suite of rights that consumers get when they purchase a movie or a television show.", "One of these is the ultraviolet consortium. Ultraviolet, which has broad backing from studios, consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers, will allow consumers to buy movies from a huge variety of retailers and then to access them at no extra charge across a broad array of apps and devices, wherever and whenever they want. It should make digital ownership just as compelling and convenient as owning a DVD, if not more so. We can't be more specific about the plans for ultraviolet today, but you can expect to hear a lot more about it and related initiatives in the coming months.", "Finally, in magazines. Content Everywhere means offering our subscribers a convenient, attractively priced way of enjoying our titles in prints and enhanced electronic versions across as many devices as possible. If you download an iPad version of one of our Time Inc. magazines, you know that it's a rich and compelling consumer experience. As you'd expect, we want to offer our customers a range of purchase options, including single copy sales, digital subscriptions and combined print and digital subscriptions. Right now, for example, subscribers to People's print edition can now access the People iPad app for free.", "In the near future, we expect to announce deals with other tablet makers that offer our readers flexible ways to access all our electronic titles. We're confident that as the competition increases in that space, every tablet manufacturer will want to give its consumers the same range of choices and the same value.", "Speaking of Publishing, before I pass it off to John, I'd like to comment on an important management change that we made during the quarter. We recently appointed Jack Griffin as the new CFO of Time Inc. As you know, Jack is succeeding Anne Moore, and Anne is retiring after for more than 33 years of outstanding service to the company. Over her tenure, Anne grew and launched some of the biggest, most important and most profitable titles in history titles like People, In Style and Real Simple. She made an indelible mark on both Time Warner and on the magazine industry.", "Now Jack just started a month ago, but all of us are excited about the energy and expertise he brings. It's already clear to everyone who has met him why he's one of the most highly regarded executives in the Publishing business.", "So wrapping up, we're performing very well on the near term, and we're very focused on the decisions that we make today that will drive value over the long term. Digital distribution clearly present some challenges to our company and to the industry, but we think it clearly offers even greater opportunities. We're excited about the progress we're making, and we're looking forward to sharing more of the details in the coming months.", "Now I'd like to hand it off to John.", "John Martin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website.", "Heading into this year, we laid out for you our goals of delivering superior financial performance and prudent capital allocation, particularly with regard to returns to shareholders. We've continued to execute on both fronts, and we are very, very pleased with our progress to date. Because of some tough comparisons coming into the quarter, we expected that the third quarter would be the slowest quarter of the year for us in terms of year-over-year growth, yet it ended up that we posted some pretty good results for the quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 5% year-over-year and just a quick note, those results did include the benefit of a $58 million or $0.05 per share related to the reversal of a litigation reserve at Turner.", "On a year-to-date basis, we've grown adjusted operating income 18% and adjusted EPS 36%. That's ahead of our own expectations, allowing us, once again, as Jeff said, we're raising our 2010 outlook for adjusted EPS to grow in the high 20s. So we're on track to deliver well north of 60% EPS growth in just the last two years.", "From a capital plan standpoint, we're also executing according to our plan. For the first nine months, we generated about $2 billion in free cash flow, and we've returned more than 100% of that to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases so far this year. And if you look at over the past 12 months, we've returned nearly $3 billion in dividends and share repurchases.", "Moving on to the next slide, which shows our consolidated third quarter financial results. Total revenues were up 2%. And underneath that, Subscription revenues continues to be a very consistent growth driver for us, up 7% in the quarter. Advertising growth was strong again, up 9%. Content revenues fell 5% in the quarter, but that was largely due to some very difficult theatrical comparisons that we had in our film studio.", "Total expenses, which include cost of revenues, SG&A and depreciation and amortization were almost flat in the quarter, and this is continued evidence of our focus on improving our operating efficiency. We've been keeping a lid on SG&A, allowing us to invest even more in Content and Other revenue generating areas. Adjusted operating income margins were also up modestly year-over-year in the quarter, and margins are up a full 200 basis points on a year-to-date basis. And we expect them to increase, again, in the fourth quarter.", "Adjusted EPS grew 17%, benefiting from earnings growth, a lower tax rate and fewer shares due to ongoing repurchases. We lowered our recurring effective tax rate due to a larger share of our earnings now coming from international territories, as well as some successful proactive tax planning. So we now expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 37% on a go-forward basis as opposed to the 38% that we previously anticipated.", "Let me now turn to our segment highlights, and let me begin with our Networks division. Here, we saw another quarter of really, really terrific revenue growth at both Turner and HBO, as well as strong adjusted operating income growth of 17%. Our results at this segment remain consistently strong, and we've grown revenue year-over-year every quarter since the beginning of the recession in 2008. That's a testament to the strength of our Networks and the consistency of its Subscription revenue base, which grew 9% in the quarter.", "We did have about 200 basis points of that growth being contributed from the consolidation of certain international operation, so I just wanted to quickly highlight that. Let me take a moment now to comment about HBO specifically where we're, once again, on track for another record year of both revenue and profits. Looking at the subscriber picture for a moment, however, right now, we expect our year-end subscriber count to be approximately 1.5 million lower than what we reported at the end of 2009, and let me go into why that's the case.", "That's due largely to unusual promotional activity by two of our distributors. First, the majority of that loss was from non-revenue-generating Cinemax subscribers that are rolling off a very aggressive retail promotion at Dish last year; and second, we've also experienced declines at another major distributor where we're currently out of contract, so we haven't benefited from normal and usual promotional activity, and we're hopeful that this situation resolves itself in a positive way in the not-too-distant future. And of course, the tough economic backdrop isn't helping.", "This year, we're not seeing the usual positive impact on subscribers from normal household formation as we've seen in most years as household formation has been quite a bit lower this year in the U.S. So importantly, these subscriber losses are almost all non-revenue-generating subscribers and by contrast, our revenue-generating HBO subscriber base has been stable over the past year. And you can see that, that's evident in our Subscription revenue growth, once again, this quarter. I also want to stress that we haven't really seen any evidence of court cutting relating to over-the-top competitors. And to the contrary, we continue to see increasing penetration from those distributors and affiliates that are focused on premium TV. And I'd also just -- one more quick highlight, HBO does have, as a quick note, over 80 million subscribers worldwide with more than 40 million outside of the U.S., and we're continuing to see very vibrant growth there.", "Turning to Advertising for a minute where we saw revenues grow 10% in the quarter. And here, international transactions contributed several hundred basis points to that growth. Our domestic Networks continue to benefit from strong scatter demand and ongoing yield management. Domestic entertainment Networks, together with kids and young adults, grew Advertising in the high-single digits. This was partly offset by a decline at domestic news due to the audience declines.", "Core Advertising growth at our international Networks was approximately 25%. Adjusted operating income, again, grew significantly faster internationally than domestically, and that's a trend that we expect will continue in the coming quarters and years. Our international margins also expanded approximately 700 basis points year-over-year.", "Looking ahead for the fourth quarter, we expect to see Advertising growth accelerate as the benefits of this year's strong upfront kick in. Demand from advertisers remains robust, pushing scatter pricing up 15% to 20% overall most at recent upfront. Adjusted operating income was up 17% in the quarter with margins expanding nearly 250 basis points year-over-year.", "Looking ahead, we expect margins to expand modestly at the Networks division in the fourth quarter. For the year, we continue to expect programming costs growth to be in the mid-single digits as we continue to execute on our strategy of investing in high-quality content. So to sum up here, given the strong top line performance to-date and the encouraging Advertising trends that should translate into very strong profit growth at our Networks division for our 2010, and in its entirety.", "Now let me move on to Film. Coming into the quarter, we expected that adjusted operating income at this division would decline year-over-year, and that was due to top theatrical comparisons. And you may recall that last year's third quarter benefited from having Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the late June release of The Hangover.", "G&A was also higher in the current quarter due to the timing and mix of theatrical releases and the shift toward international self-distribution of new line titles. Nevertheless, this comparison masks some really bright spots in the quarter. And as Jeff said, Inception was a blockbuster, and it's generated more than $800 million now at the global box office. And we benefited from the off network television sales of Two and A Half Men and the New Adventures of Old Christine. Just as importantly, the success of The Big Bang Theory on Thursday nights has further solidified the outlook for our television revenues in the coming years.", "And again, as Jeff mentioned, we're seeing some very promising performances from several of our new and returning TV shows. Home entertainment revenues were up slightly in the quarter, and they're now up 8% on a year-to-date basis, and we remain very focused on driving higher margin products, and we've seen it pay off in recent quarters, and that's evidenced by growth in Blu-ray, Video-on-Demand and electronic sell-through. Warner Bros. has been building on its leading position across all of these categories, increasing its share of the home entertainment category by well over 200 basis points year-to-date. As these revenue lines continue to grow, we expect home-video margins to further improve as well.", "Looking forward, we are very, very optimistic about our fourth quarter theatrical slate, which includes Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows, that's the first part and then Due Date. And with adjusted operating income up 1% on a year-to-date basis here at this division despite very, very tough comparisons against record results in 2009, we believe we're on track for another great year at Warner Bros.", "Let me move on to Publishing where we've continue to drive up margins through effective operational improvements and cost controls. Advertising revenues continue to recover, increasing 5% in the quarter and there, digital Advertising was particularly strong, growing over 20% in the quarter. Looking across Time Inc.'s three primary operating units, its style and entertainment unit and the lifestyle units grew Advertising in the quarter, and that was offset by a modest decline at news, and that was largely due to magazine closures that occurred in the prior year.", "Style and entertainment continues to be our strongest performing group by far. Our Advertising growth comparisons do get more difficult in the fourth quarter, and I also wanted to highlight that in addition, based on a deal that was completed a little bit earlier this year, Turner is now managing SI.com and Golf.com for Time Inc. And as a result, Time Inc. is not going to be booking the Advertising revenues generated by these sites starting in the fourth quarter. So that, coupled with the difficult comparisons, may make year-over-year growth in Advertising, tough to achieve at this division.", "However, we still expect Advertising to be up for the full year. As we've anticipated, Subscription revenues were down 5% in the quarter and about half of this decline was due to unfavorable FX. Domestic Subscription and newsstand sales also fell modestly.", "Looking ahead to the next quarter, we expect FX once again to be somewhat of a drag on description revenue, and we also expect continued pressure on Subscription and newsstand comparisons are going to get more difficult. So all in all, we anticipate a similar year-over-year decline in Subscription revenue in the fourth quarter at Time Inc.", "Operating income was up 45% in the third quarter, and margins increased 500 basis points year-over-year. This is the fourth quarter in a row of margin improvement at Time Inc, and so we're pleased with that. Total expenses were down almost $60 million year-over-year, and that was reflected operational improvements and cost initiatives, including lower pension expenses.", "We should continue to see the benefit of those initiatives in the fourth quarter, and restructuring charges will also be down significantly year-over-year in Q4. So we expect another quarter of solid growth in operating income at Time Inc.", "So with the division review completed, let's look to the consolidated outlook. We continue to be very encouraged by the strength of our results for the first nine months, and we're continuing to invest more in programming in TV and film production, and that investment should make the company stronger for the future. But at the same time, we've been able to deliver very strong near-term financial results. Our solid execution has given us confidence once again to raise the full year outlook. And as we put in our release this morning, we now expect adjusted EPS to grow in the high 20s, and that's off of a base of $1.83 last year. Our full year outlook has continued to strengthen throughout the year, and we now expect to grow revenues by more than $1 billion year-over-year in 2010, and that's the best result we've had in several years.", "We're also aggressively managing our expenses and investments, and so let me talk about what I mean by that. Overall for the year, expenses will likely be up only in the low-single digits. But we're fully investing in our best businesses to drive growth, and this is evidenced by a high single-digit increase in our investment in programming, including originals and sports, television and film production and marketing. And at the same time, we expect the rest of our expenses to be down in the low- to mid-single digits, and that's how we're improving margins and that's how we're improving returns, while we're still investing for the future.", "Let me turn now and look at free cash flow very, very briefly. So let's turn to the next slide. Year-to-date, we've generated $2 billion of free cash flow, that's a healthy conversion over 40% of adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization, and it's almost 100% of adjusted income from continuing operations. The increase in working capital as you see here includes a $250 million payment related to the resolution of some litigation, as well as a $70 million payment made to the NCAA tied to the beginning of the March Madness contract, which will be next year. Factoring out these two payments, our free cash flow actually compared to last year is down only very slightly, and that's due to an increase in accounts receivable tied to revenue growth, as well as higher cash taxes and cash interest.", "We expect and we'll continue to maintain a high conversion rate of both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted income from continuing operations and some free cash flow. So let me move on to the final slide here, which looks at our net debt. We ended the quarter with about $12.5 billion in net debt, and that's up about $1.1 billion compared to the end of last year, and it's up slightly compared to the second quarter. The increase is a result of us returning more than 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders year-to-date, and we've also spent almost $600 million to date on acquisitions. And we paid premiums and transactions costs that total about $370 million, and that's related to the redemptions of debt securities previously announced.", "International expansion remains one of our top priorities as a company, and that's reflected in how we're allocating capital. About 80% of our M&A activity has been on international Cable Networks, and we've continued to invest in international Cable Networks at Turner, which closed recently on two acquisitions. The first was a company named MMG. It's a Scandinavian channel group where we see a nice opportunity to strengthen our position in the region. And we've also recently added Chilevisi\u00f3n one of the leading broadcasters in Chile to our already strong Latin American business.", "Warner Bros. also expanded its international footprint with the recent acquisition of Shed Media, a leading TV producer in the U.K., and this acquisition is part of its strategy to grow international local language production. All of these acquisitions were done at attractive prices and for reasonable multiples, and they should help drive further international growth.", "So with only one quarter left in the year, we are on track to achieve our capital plan priorities and objectives. First, we'll continue to invest in our businesses to improve their strategic position and drive long-term growth. That's evidenced by our increased investment and programming production and marketing this year.", "Second, we're committed to providing direct returns to stockholders through dividends and buybacks, and as I previously mentioned, we've now returned over $2.2 billion so far this year, including $1.5 billion in share repurchases. And including our regular dividend, we've had a fairly consistent return of approximately $750 million a quarter recently, and we may look to grow that over time.", "And third, we're focused on our capital structure and carefully managing our debt maturities. Our leverage ratio is now about 2x. That's still a bit below our long-term target of 2.5x. But today, we consider the strategic flexibility to be a competitive advantage in the current environment. So we remain comfortable operating in this range at least for the time being. Looking out over the next five years, we have less than $2.5 billion in total debt maturities, so we feel really good about how we're positioned there as well.", "So that concludes my proactive remarks. Let me turn the call back over to Doug, and we'll be ready to start the Q&A portion of the call.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks a lot. Keith, let's get the Q&A started please. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Spencer Wang with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I just have one two-part question on Cable Networks because obviously, a lot of discussion or debate around potential cord cutting. So my first question is for John. Could you just give us a little bit more color on the subscriber growth you saw for some of the fully distributed domestic Networks like TNT or TBS, and you guys are basically fully distributed and have distribution across all the different distributors either on a year-over-year or sequential basis, so that's the first part. And then the second part is for Jeff. If at some point cord cutting does emerge, how would you change the strategy at either HBO or Turner to adapt?", "John Martin", "It's John. I'll take the first part of the question in the order which you asked. The first thing I guess I would say just to repeat what you said is part of the question, which is just a reminder for everybody that the majority of our Networks are fully distributed in the U.S. And so over time, we would expect that they will follow, in terms of numbers of subscribers, what ends up happening as it relates to the overall multi-channel household universe, which has been mature for some time. In terms of giving additional clarity with respect to recent trends, though, I'm afraid we'll probably not going to be able to do that. In fact, I would suspect that the distributors themselves would be the first to report that because the way that we get our information at the Networks from the distributors tends to be on a couple of month lag basis. And so while we would fully expect to be up year-over-year, I'm just not sure that we have the most recent information as it relates to sequential trending. So I would say we'll have to wait and get better information over the next couple of months because the last information we have is probably really just the beginning of the third quarter.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "On the cord cutting, we're not seeing -- we doubt that we're going to see it, although we'll all watch for it. If you look at TV viewing across all the different Networks, it's a very healthy picture, ratings, programming quality, the strength of these brands. So I guess the most important thing and we've been fairly outspoken about it is that if you take all of these Networks, not just ours but the industry, and you have them on demand, we've seen how powerful it is at HBO. I think we're about to see how powerful it is when you can watch whatever your favorite network is on all kinds of devices on demand and on your TV set, that's going to strength in TV viewing. It's probably going to not lead to any cord cutting. Now in the long run, with viewers preference is being clear that they love all these Networks, if you have to reach them through some other distribution than the one that we currently have, then that's how the content industry will evolve. But I don't think that's likely to happen. If it does happen, we think that the Network business is very strong in either case.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Michael Nathanson with Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "I have two. One for Jeff and one for John. Jeff, a question would be on HBO GO, what's the reason for the delay of the rollout? We've expected you to be further rolled out by now. And is it a function of a new HBO affiliate deals that have to be signed, just give a little background on HBO GO?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "No. There is no real hangup on it. It's currently being distributed by Comcast and Verizon. We've got several very big distributors you're going to see very soon on a matter of weeks. We think as far as we know, every one of our distributors whether satellite, Cable or telco is launching this as vigorously and as quickly as they can. So you're going to see it fairly widespread by the end of this year and in the early first quarter, second quarter of next year, I think we'll have it everywhere. And I think it's going to perform very strongly. It is the indication we've gotten so far.", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "And then for John, one of the questions we have is do you know offhand what percentage of TBS TNT audience is coming from original and sports where you put more investment versus the syndicated content. Have you done analysis on the audience flow at TBS and TNT?", "John Martin", "Yes, I mean, of course, we have that information. They've got it down there. I just don't know it right off the top of my head. We'd have to get back to you.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "It occurs to me one thing I should add on the HBO GO question, at the same time, we're going to be rolling out all these deals and HBO GO to all our subs to all our distributors, we're also going to roll it out through consumer electronic and mobile devices with authentication. And one of the things you've already seeing, which is Google TV is just one of the first steps in that process. And I think you're going to see it on all CE and mobile devices with a fair amount, of course, behind it.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "Ron Sanders spoke yesterday, the videoconference in L.A. He mentioned that the 28-day window that you all have imposed on Netflix and Redbox is actually not long enough. I presume he was talking relative to the discount you're giving them and the need to kind of to protect or enhance your sell-through business. Could you give us a sense on how soon this could change, meaning how long could we see, when will we see a longer window and what the right window might be? And then just kind of attached to that, there was a discussion in the conference about potentially cutting back on the amount of catalog movies and TV shows that you make available to Netflix. What are your thoughts about, first, kind of the near-term revenue and profits to kind of protect the long-term health of your business and prevent cord cutting?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "We're always going to focus on our long-term profits and sustainability over any short-term ones. So I think it's a good question. And basically, we're not religious about any of this. And we're just trying to maximize the value of our content as we see these alternatives develop. What we think is that so far the 28-day window has clearly been a success versus no delay. The vast majority of sales do occur in the first 28 days put there and it helps sales. So that's been good at least to go that far. The question of whether we ought to go longer is very much under scrutiny. It may well be a good idea. We haven't reached that yet. We will be able to do that because if we decide to change it, we can do that next year because that's when our deals all come up for a decision by us.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Questions for both of you on back on HBO, and John, I don't know if you're willing to do this but the 1.5 million I think that's the Subscription number and so I was curious if you have a sort of household number. I'm trying to understand how much of those Cinemax sort of free Dish subs or Dish subscriptions are also HBO customers. If you're seeing a spillover into terms of losses on the HBO side as well. And I don't know if you'd be willing to carve the 1.5 million up between Dish and DTV and the household element to it because obviously, those are two different elements to what's happening. And then as a follow-up to all the HBO stuff, Jeff, is it direct to consumer offer on the table or off the table or under consideration? How do you think about that in relation to HBO's long-standing model, which has been, obviously, a big success in their relationships with distributors and the other studios and just would love to hear your thoughts on that front.", "John Martin", "So, Ben, with respect to your question, we don't disclose historically, and we're not going to start at this moment household figures for the HBO Cinemax Subscription relationships. And just going back to what we said on the call, the majority of the loss is coming from an aggressive promotion that was down at the DISH Network, and that was Cinemax. And that was non-revenue-generating. So I mean, as we look at it, obviously, the subscriber numbers are instructive and illustrative, but they're just subscriber figures and what we're really more focused on is making money and driving revenue growth. And if you look at the Subscription revenue trends at HBO, they have been and continue to be extremely healthy. And so we wanted to provide some transparency with respect to the direction of the subscriber numbers. But we do not believe it's going to translate into any softness or weakness in Subscription revenues. And so that's what's most important. So I understand your question. We just don't break it out at that level of detail.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Let me add something to that because I was at HBO for years. I think that the sub trends at HBO, the underlying paid sub trends are healthy and good from my point by point of view looking forward. And we always have a band of promotional subs depending on what affiliates giving away Cinemax subs for very low prices. We are still in the band. We, basically, are used to, although our promotional subs is about 10% to 15%. And so this basically lines up with various deal renewals and some of the leverage that gets put into play. I think HBO is in very solid shape. It's just a function of promotional and deal renewal activity. So on the question you raised about HBO going direct, we do have the ability to do that. And it's not something that we have decided to do today because as you've said, we have a very good relationship and very good position where HBO occupies the position that it does in all of the TV and video packages for all the different distributors. There's a lot of marketing customer service and so on benefits that go with that. And I think the questions we already had about vigorous launch of HBO GO are important to seeing all of us get HBO out there and get it in the hands of all of our subs. If that doesn't work well, or speedily enough, then we have the option of adding a direct sale of HBO.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "One for Jeff, one for John. I mean, Jeff, you talked about digital distribution at length. I'm curious on one specific aspect, I think which was headed down this path. But how do you balance allowing greater access to your TV shows, I guess, your movies and their newer released windows versus the value of those shows might have in later windows or syndications. So is there a shift in value there? And how do you know if the benefit to the earlier windows is outpacing the damage to the later windows? So that's the first for Jeff and then for John, just I know you've been focused on rolling over the existing debt structure but high markets ridiculous right now, I think, you can issue 30s in a mid-single digit yields range. So in this market just too good an opportunity to pass up, wouldn't now be the time to stretch your leverage target higher?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Yes, you're absolutely right. When we or anyone is looking at selling licensing, let's say, our TV product, we could do movies, we could do TV, whichever. You have to look at the total largest pool to keep the value through all the different windows. So we absolutely evaluate everything from Apple TV rentals, we're not going forward to sales and licensing agreements within like Netflix or Hoovu [ph] in the context of what is best, in this case, for Warner's on providing the most healthy revenue support for the licensing that we do because there a lot of things that have been proposed in \"digital\" that are really not in the interest of the studio just thinking of studio interest alone. At the same time, we also have Networks, so we keep an eye on that too. So far, all the choices we made and what we've done, what we haven't done and this can vary show by show, have been we've actually found an alliance calculation between what's best for Warner and what, say, would be best for HBO and Turner in the long-term industry structure. So we haven't seen many things that conflict in that. And as you can tell by the things we've done and not done, we don't agree with some of the moves that our studio competitors have taken. We think it's bad for the value of their content.", "John Martin", "Your comment about the interest rate environment is, obviously, not lost on us. And in fact, last quarter, year-to-date, we've issued about $5 billion in the public debt markets at very, very attractive rates. And that has allowed us to push out our maturity on average by about four years, while at the same time, and this is rare when you can do this, we lowered our average interest costs by about $60 million a year. And all of that was done to take advantage of the interest rate environment and to frankly, increase our flexibility. And as I mentioned in my proactive remarks, you look out over the next five years, we've only got about two -- less than $2.5 billion of total maturities coming due. So we've got outstanding liquidity with no near-term maturities, which is a really nice place to be and more broadly speaking from a capital allocation standpoint, we think about our leverage target and the context of overall capital allocation, and it's really about making sure that we're preserving adequate flexibility, making sure that we have constant access to the capital markets at attractive prices and at the same time, optimizing returns. And if you look at how we approach capital allocation that's exactly what we've been doing, and we've taken a very consistent and balanced approach between strengthening the balance sheet, which we did mostly last year, having a meaningful buyback program, complement a meaningful dividend at the same time, engaging it to try to grow the businesses through M&A. So we've taken a balanced and consistent approach, and we're going to continue to maintain that going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays Capital.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "I have two questions. One on HBO and one on Turner. My HBO question is around digital rights on HBO GO. When it comes to digital distribution of the movie content that you have with your partners be it Fox, Universal, DreamWorks Animation. I think DreamWorks Animation is not currently licensing its films to HBO GO in digital format. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about where the rights stand with your studio partners there.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Yes. No, DreamWorks rights are fully licensed to HBO. And if you want to turn on your HBO subscript your TV, which I know you all have, you can watch DreamWorks movies on demand on HBO right now.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "No, I mean HBO GO, so for example, I have...", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Yes, including on HBO GO or MAX Go...", "John Martin", "MAX Go...", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "So we do have all rights to our studios. We have all on demand rights for both TV and Internet for all our programming on HBO and all the movies, all the originals, everything.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "I don't know if that was consistent with comments that were made on the DreamWorks call. But maybe we'll talk about that off-line. The second question I have is about Turner and I think it's great news that you've rolled out TNT and TBS on TV Everywhere across Comcast and digital prints. I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about the feedback that you get from your Advertising buyers, your advertisers about that transition whether or not ratings measurement or potentially the lower CPMs that our market rate online will be an issue there.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "The advertisers love it, and you should ask all of them because particularly in this C3 window, which is the first window, they're able to basically sell in that branded high-CPM environment across platforms. So it's basically, I think you may have had either a question or a premise about different Internet at higher rates. That's not the case on TV Everywhere ad sales and remember the loads are going to be the same and on all the Networks whether you're watching a show on Turner on demand on TV or on broadband. In the C3 window, it's the same ads, it's the same feed. So we're agnostic and so are the advertisers. In the world of VOD, which is the more delayed, the last week or the last three or four episodes, the industry in general whether on TV or on broadband is supporting on an ad model. I think there's a lot to be figured out there, but it probably won't distinguish between watching an ad on a Turner show from whether it's on a TV VOD or an Internet VOD version of a TNT show will probably be the same box.", "Operator", "And your questions from the line of Imran Khan with JPMorgan.", "Imran Khan - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I have a question about HBO as well and a Publishing question. HBO, it's my understanding that you get much more favorable revenue splits from MSOs compared to your competitors. So I was wondering as the -- there's a lot of contentious debate about content, how much content will get from the MSOs. Do you expect to see pressure from the MSOs in terms of your revenue splits from what you get and do you think it might go down? And secondly, in terms of Publishing business, this year you were benefited by some of the operational improvement that you made last year. As we look forward a couple of years, how should we think about the profitability of the Publishing business. Clearly, some challenge from the Subscription side. Are you seeing -- can we offset that from the digital distribution? Is there any further cost pending opportunities, how should we think about the Publishing business as we look out over the next couple of years?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "I'll start with HBO. On the affiliate on the place that HBO occupies in consumer homes, consumer packages, it's going up. The program is getting stronger. So we think it's a very healthy upward trend in HBO GO. We'll just increase that. For the affiliate, in terms of their ability and willingness and happiness to pay increasing wholesale rates, we think that's there too, and we think that we will be strengthening our rates at HBO steadily as we have been.", "John Martin", "Imran, it's John. On Publishing, I guess, I would say a few things. First of all, as you think about the growth prospects of this division on a go-forward basis. We're coming at it from a position where we've retrenched in profits quite a bit as we went into the Advertising downturn. And so we've been able to maintain margin and grow this year's margin by virtue of a lot of the operational improvement initiatives that you highlighted in your question. If you think about it on a going-forward basis, I think there are numerous avenues of growth. First, I would say traditional print Advertising where we're still in I would say, hopefully the early days of what's a cyclical rebound and a cyclical recovery. And everybody knows that the economy has improved. Our print Advertising is not as strong as our TV Advertising. But nevertheless, we have a lot of confidence in our brands, and we think that we can drive Advertising over the foreseeable future in our print brands. I think Subscription trends are challenging but stable. And so I don't think that there's going to be any major source of downward trend there. It's going to be more stable, can we grow it. I think that's the challenge for our company in the industry. I think there's a huge longer-term opportunity in digital magazines, magazines on tablets, all sorts of brand extensions. But the too long an answer for this call. And then your question, which is really on operational improvements, the division has done a tremendous job over the last several years of reorganizing and re-engineering the way they do business and pulling out literally hundreds of millions of dollars of fixed cost that's not going to go back into the business. I think that operational engineering and improvement is a way of life at that division, and I would anticipate that there are further opportunities that we will explore over time. I would just note that with Jack Griffin now coming on board and just recognizing that he's only been at Time Inc. for a few weeks we'll obviously be working very, very closely with Jack and interested in his ideas as we look to continue to improve not only the top line, but margin opportunity there as well. And so I won't go into a lot of the detail, but there are opportunities.", "Operator", "Your final question is from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Inc", "Maybe just building on where you left off, I think Meredith made significant inroads with your integrated marketing division with Mr. Griffin coming on board, do you think that's one area that you would consider investing in as a way to capitalize on the interest structure on asset that you have at Time Inc?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Yes, because Jack was the one who invented and built that at Meredith. And we've talked a lot about that. So yes.", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Inc", "And how long do you think that would take before it begins to show up in the top line, is it three to five years?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "No, shorter than that.", "Douglas Shapiro", "All right.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Doug Shapiro, SVP Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Well, thanks a lot, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued 2 press releases: One, detailing our results for the first quarter, and the other reaffirming our 2011 full year business outlook.", "Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's on our site.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Thank you, and with that, I'll turn the call over the Jeff.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug, and thanks for listening in this morning. I'm very pleased with how we started off the year. We posted strong metrics this quarter including almost 20% revenue growth at our Networks segment. And while we knew coming in that we faced tough profit comparisons this quarter, our results came in right where we expected, putting us firmly on track to achieve our outlook for the full year. ", "We're also making a lot of progress toward our longer-term strategic objectives. In particular, our efforts to allow consumers to buy our content once and then access it on whatever device they want, wherever and whenever they want, a set of initiatives that we call Content Everywhere, continue to gather momentum.", "John will talk about our financial results in detail in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to highlight some of the key operational and strategic milestones that we have achieved over the past few months. And I'll start with Turner, where our investment in must-see sports is really paying off.", "Of course, the big story this quarter was our NCAA coverage. It was a huge success commercially and creatively and a big boost for the TBS, TNT and truTV brands. Our collaboration with CBS worked even better than we'd anticipated in every way: ratings, financial performance, quality of the coverage and integration of our sales efforts. It was the most watched tournament since 2005, and traffic for March Madness On Demand was up over 60%. We also surpassed our expectations for ad sales, which powered Turner to over 30% ad revenue growth in the quarter.", "Our investment in sports is also paying off with the NBA. The 2010-2011 regular season was the most watched in Turner's 27 years of airing the NBA, and it was up more than 40% over last year. That momentum has continued into the playoffs, making TNT the #1 network on basic cable in April and, on some nights, making TNT the #1 network on all of television.", "CNN's performance this quarter was a testament to the critical role it plays in America and throughout the world. In the midst of the catastrophe in Japan and unrest in the Middle East, CNN\u2019s prime time ratings were up more than 30% during the quarter while both of its cable news competitors saw declines. This shows that when news breaks, viewers seek out the breadth of coverage, the exceptional journalism and the trusted brand that only CNN offers. It also shows why CNN is always indispensable to its affiliates even if ratings sometimes fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.", "You're probably curious to get our view on the upcoming upfront. I won't be too specific. But with the current premiums in the scatter market, very low levels of cancellations and supply constraints at most of the broadcast networks, all the indicators are very positive. The combination of our strong brands, high-quality programming and talented sales force makes us confident that our pricing will again be near the top end of the industry range across broadcast and Cable.  At HBO, our investments in high-quality content are also paying off. Last month, we debuted Game of Thrones to tremendous critical acclaim, and the premier has already attracted 8 million viewers. When added to our roster of other tent-pole shows like True Blood and Boardwalk Empire, HBO now has the strongest slate of programming in its history. Just as this week, we also launched HBO GO on mobile devices including the iPad, iPhone and Android smartphones. Our iPad app is getting rave reviews from the consumers who are using it, and it was the most downloaded free iPad app in iTunes this weekend.", "HBO GO is the first fully realized example of what TV Everywhere can be. And to those of you who've seen it, you know that it represents a quantum leap in the consumer value of subscribing to HBO. Besides all the benefits it provides to HBO and to HBO subscribers, we think it could also substantially increase consumer awareness of the TV Everywhere concept and accelerate momentum for the initiative across the industry.", "Over the course of the year, we intend to steadily introduce new features including some that HBO can uniquely provide and expand availability to additional tablets and connected devices. HBO GO is now available through almost all of our major distributors, reaching about 80% of our subscriber base.", "Time Warner Cable and Cablevision are the main exceptions. We're optimistic that these distributors will also realize the benefits of providing their highest revenue subscribers all this additional value at no extra cost.", "Turning to our film and TV production businesses. Warner Bros. had a relatively light release late this quarter, but we're optimistic about the schedule for the rest of the year, which includes The Hangover Part I, Green Lantern, the eagerly anticipated finale of the Harry Potter franchise, Happy Feet 2 and Sherlock Holmes 2. ", "We're also extremely well positioned at Warner Bros TV. As you know, we have a great syndication pipeline this year, most notably headlined by The Big Bang Theory. And although it's often overlooked, keep in mind that the strong advertising environment benefits Warner Bros. too. For many of our first on-and-off net syndicated shows, Warner makes up a big portion of our revenue. So while it's too early to talk about our pickups this year, we're feeling optimistic as we head into the broadcast upfronts in the next couple of weeks, both in terms of our powerful lineup of returning shows and in terms of new pilots.", "With our strong film slate, the momentum in our TV business and several promising games, we continue to expect Warner will post record profits this year. ", "I also want to talk for a moment about the important progress we've made toward our key home video digital initiatives over the last few months. As home video transactions continue to transition to digital, we have 2 main goals. First, we want to advantage our most profitable distribution channels; and second, we're working hard to make digital ownership more compelling for consumers. Toward these ends, we became the first studio to make it possible to rent movies through Facebook. And last week, we launched our test of premium VOD called Home Premier by offering the movie, Hall Pass through DirecTV. ", "Similar to what we've done with other new windows, over the next few months, we'll expand the test to other titles and other distributors and then evaluate the impact. ", "This week, we also agreed to acquire Flixster, a social network for movie fans. We'll use the Flixster brand and platform to launch several initiatives that aim to dramatically improve the consumer proposition of owning digital movies, and we'll do that in a studio-agnostic way that should benefit the whole industry. We will share more details in time. But in short order, we plan to expand the functionality of Flixster to allow consumers to organize and access their digital movie collections on whatever device they like as well as buy and rent movies.", "Finally at Time Inc. During the quarter, we remain focused on outperforming the industry and maintaining the right cost structure. Like our other businesses, we also focused on giving consumers access to our content on more devices. We launched SI All Access, which enables Sports Illustrated readers to pay one price to get the print edition, as well as a digital edition and to have it accessible online or on Android tablets and smartphones. And we just reached agreement with Apple to enable our print subscribers to access the iPad versions of Time, Sports Illustrated and FORTUNE at no extra cost. ", "Before I hand it off to John, one final note. As you probably noticed, this quarter, we bought back about $1 billion of our stock. That's double the quarterly pace of last year, and it represents about 2.5% of our equity base in just one quarter. This step reflects our commitment to continue to enhance stockholder returns and our confidence in the value of our stock, our competitive position and our growth prospects. ", "And with that, I'll turn it over to John.", "John Martin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. During my remarks I'll be referring to a presentation that is now available on our website. ", "So let me begin with the first slide, which shows the highlights for the quarter. Last quarter, I talked about our plans to be even more aggressive this year, pursuing our goals of investment, growth and returns, and I think we're off to a great start this year. ", "Heading into the year, we knew as Jeff said, that the first quarter would be our most challenged from a profit growth perspective. This was due to the timing of programming investments, particularly in the NCAA Tournament and the timing of our film slate, which is heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. Nevertheless, we are very pleased with our strong revenue growth in the quarter, and that was helped by the great performance of the NCAA, which surpassed our expectations and was a major driver of advertising growth.", "And while adjusted operating income was down year-over-year, it came in pretty much as we expected, and we firmly remain on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. And this morning, we reaffirmed our outlook for low-teens growth in adjusted EPS in 2011. We aim to do that while investing even more in our businesses and returning even more capital to our shareholders. ", "During the quarter, as Jeff said, we repurchased about $1 billion of our shares, and we paid $260 million in dividends. That marks a significant acceleration from our previous pace of direct returns and underscores our confidence in the fundamentals of our businesses and their cash generation capabilities.", "Moving over to the next slide, which shows consolidated first quarter financial highlights. Revenues were up 6% or more than $350 million year-over-year, and that was led by robust growth in both Subscription and Advertising revenues. Content revenues were down year-over-year, and that was due primarily to the tough comps at the studio. ", "Overall operating expenses grew over 10%, causing adjusted operating income to decline by 10% year-over-year. This quarter, the programming production and marketing expenses were up a lot, and much of that was due to the costs of the NCAA Tournament. Over the remainder of the year, we expect that these expenses should grow in the mid-single digits. So margin trends should improve as the year progresses.", "In general, we're continuing our efforts to fund investment in high-quality content and other revenue-generating areas by reallocating capital away from overhead. That was evident again this quarter. Beyond programming production and marketing as well as acquisitions, our expenses grew only in the low-single digits year-over-year. ", "Continuing to move down the P&L. Adjusted EPS declined 5% in the quarter. That was a smaller decline as compared to adjusted operating income, and that's because of our ongoing share repurchase program.", "Turning now to our segment highlights, and let's begin at the Networks division, where we had very strong revenue growth at both Turner and HBO. Advertising revenues were up 31%. This was driven largely by both the NCAA coverage on our networks and the generally strong domestic pricing environment. Our domestic entertainment networks, which includes kids and young adults, grew advertising over 30% in the quarter. Domestic news was up in the high single digits, and that was helped by the improved audience delivery at CNN.", "International Advertising revenue grew over 50% in the quarter, and growth here was helped by some transactions we've done in the past year. And if you look through those, Advertising revenues were up single digits. ", "Growth was much stronger than that in our European and Latin American entertainment businesses, which were both up strong double digits on an organic basis. But Asia and International News were negatively impacted by the events in the Middle East and Japan. And as a result of that, they were both down in the quarter.", "So far in the second quarter, domestic scatter pricing remains robust, up 20% to 30% over the upfront, and cancellations remain low. We obviously won't get the same magnitude of lift in the second quarter from the NCAA Tournament. But we still expect very, very healthy year-over-year growth. And as Jeff mentioned, we feel extremely well positioned heading into the upfront.", "Subscription revenue growth remained really terrific in the first quarter, up 9%. That reflects consistent strong growth trends domestically as well as continued expansion in growth internationally. Moving on, content revenues were up almost 50%, and that was led by the strong demand for HBO's original programming, including The Pacific, Sex and the City and Boardwalk Empire. ", "Adjusted operating income was up 2% in the quarter as the Networks grew. There were 2 reasons why year-over-year growth was so modest during the quarter. The first obviously is the NCAA Tournament, where we recognized the significant majority of the costs for the year during the first quarter when the tournament was aired. Most of the remaining costs will be recognized in the second quarter, and beyond that, non-NCAA-related programming expenses also grew at a higher rate in the first quarter as compared to what we expect for the full year, but that was really due just to timing. ", "So before I move on here, let me just quickly pause and give you an update on HBO subscriber counts. We said coming into the year that we expected the U.S. subscriber count to stabilize this year, and I'm happy to report that that's exactly what we've seen so far this year. So we feel pretty good about that.", "Let me turn now to film on the next slide. And as Jeff said this is a very light quarter for us. And again, we knew coming into the quarter that both revenue and adjusted operating income would be down significantly year-over-year. This was due to the tough comparisons in both theatrical and home video and a 2011 release slate that is more weighted towards later quarters. ", "Last year's first quarter, for example, benefited from the strong theatrical performances of Sherlock Holmes and The Blind Side, and we just didn't have any comparable titles this year. The Blind Side was also particularly strong on home video for us. That comparison, along with significantly fewer releases was the largest factor in the 21% decline in home video revenue in the quarter. ", "On a more positive note, the performance of our television product was very strong in the quarter, and we have really been pleased with the initial home video release sales of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, which was released last month. This underscores the continued strong demand in home entertainment for our event films.", "Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate record film profits in 2011. Our release slate starts to pick up at the second quarter with the theatrical releases of The Hangover II and the Green Lantern. In addition to the Harry Potter home video release, we have a great games lineup with Mortal Kombat 9 and LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean. That momentum should continue as the year progresses with the actual releases like the final Harry Potter and Happy Feet 2 as well as the syndication sale of Big Bang Theory. So we feel very good about the year here.", "Moving over to Publishing. Advertising revenues were essentially flat in the quarter, but the reported growth rate here was affected by the transfer of management of SI.com and Golf.com to Turner and the divestiture of certain titles at IPC. Excluding these 2 items, overall Advertising revenues were up 4% in the quarter, and digital Advertising revenues were up double digits. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate underlying domestic advertising trends to remain positive. ", "Turning over to subscription revenues for a moment, the majority of the decline in the first quarter was in our International business, which was impacted by the divestitures at IPC that I just mentioned.", "Domestic subscription revenue was also somewhat lower, however, due partly to continued pressure at newsstands. But we are seeing subscription fundamentals begin to stabilize. And as the year progresses, we expect to see an improvement in year-over-year revenue trends, particularly in the second half of the year. That reflects both favorable trends in renewals as well as the ramp up of new retail partnerships.", "Operating income at Time Inc. was up 26%, with margins up 160 basis points. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement at Time Inc. ", "Total expenses here were down nearly $15 million over last year as we continue to remain focused on cost management. For the year, we continue to expect overall expenses at Publishing to be relatively flat as compared to 2010.", "Moving to the next slide, which contains our 2011 outlook. Let me just pause for a second and talk about our expectations for the second quarter. As I mentioned before, coming into the year, we anticipated that the first quarter would be our most challenged from a profit growth rate perspective, and we absolutely expect profits to grow in the second quarter year-over-year. But keep in mind that we still expect to incur modest losses on the NCAA contract. And at our Film division, we expect P&A spending to be higher than the prior year, and we also expect to incur restructuring costs in the neighborhood of $25 million to $30 million.", "So for Q2, we expect that year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income will clearly be considerably better than the first quarter but will lag what we will see in each of the third and fourth quarters of this year. Growth should accelerate significantly in the second half as we benefit from an improving film slate, a strong syndication lineup and lower programming expense growth at the networks.", "Turning to the next slide, which looks at our free cash flow. We generated approximately $700 million of free cash in the quarter. That's a good start for the year but somewhat below the year ago levels. And the decline year-over-year was due mainly to the significant increase in working capital, and that was primarily attributable to the timing of TV-syndication receipts and lower home video sales during the 2010 holiday season. Interest payments, cash taxes and CapEx were also somewhat higher. ", "Looking at the final slide, which takes a look at our net debt. We ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in net debt, that's up about $650 million compared to the end of last year, and that's due to the increased pace of direct returns to shareholders. We returned, as I mentioned, over $1.2 billion during the quarter including $1 billion in share repurchases. So our total direct returns were up 60% over the first quarter a year ago.", "During the quarter, we also spent about $160 million on M&A activity, and that related primarily to our acquisition of additional interest in HBO's operations in Latin America as well as increased ownership interest in CME. We saw this as a nice opportunity to further increase our exposure to businesses and regions where we see significant growth opportunities in the coming years. These acquisitions are consistent with our focus on international networks, which we expect to be one of the biggest growth drivers for the company over the next several years.", "As a result of these actions, our leverage ratio is now almost 2.2x. That's up from around 2x at year end. That's consistent with our plans to move closer to our target leverage of about 2.5x by the year end this year in an effort to better optimize our capital structure. ", "One last thing to note. Last month, we issued about $2 billion of public debt. We were able to access the markets at very attractive rates while further extending the average length of our debt maturities. As you know, we manage our capital structure with a goal of striking the right balance between maintaining a strong liquid balance sheet with solid credit ratings and actively deploying our capital to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and to return capital to our shareholders. So we're quite pleased with our progress that we made on our capital plan so far this year. And so with that being concluded, let me now turn the call back over to Doug to start the Q&A part of this session.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Okay, thanks. Let's get the Q&A started.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "I have one for Jeff and one for John. Jeff, you mentioned how pleased you were about the NCAA and how well it performed. I just want to say like there's a general feeling in the market that CBS made a good deal by getting rid of losses they were going to have and moving those losses to Turner. So if you could talk a bit about how big losses were this year for you and how do you see the trend over time for the NCAA deal helping Turner.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Yes, we think that this is going to be a very profitable deal over time, and it's actually performing in revenue terms, ratings terms as well, better than we expected. But because of the structure of the deal over the 14 years, where a lot of the advantage comes to us because we have 3 networks in the deal and because we have some affiliate fee upside that we think is very large, we don't have as much versus CBS in the first year. And I think John, who explained it pretty well in his descriptive remark, should flesh it out. So I'll just give it to you.", "John Martin", "Sure. Let me attempt to clarify because the nature of the agreement is in some respects, pretty simple. But then there's a loss cap calculation that's a little complicated. Let me begin by saying economically, we share revenues and costs equally with CBS, subject to the loss caps, and I'm going to come back to that in a minute. But as Jeff said, that means that we're going to share programming rights fees up to nearly $11 billion over the 14-year term, and that includes fees as well as production costs and ad revenues to be shared equally by Turner and CBS. CBS losses however, are limited to certain pre-specified annual amounts and I think we've included those in our public filings. In the first quarter, we did trigger the loss cap, but the amount incurred under that cap was not significant at all. We think it's important to note that the loss cap is based on a cash cost, not a book cost. That's very important to understand, and the calculation is the same for us as it is for CBS. The cash cost increases very, very slowly over the 14-year life of the agreement. And going into the agreement, we fully expected that we were going to be losing money on a cash basis in the early years in the contract. But just to reiterate what Jeff said, we fully expect to make that up as we move into the agreement and we're highly confident only supported even more by the performance from this Tournament, that this is going to be incredibly accretive on an NPV basis in the fullness of time. And then the question is, \u201cWhy did we agree to cap CBS losses?\u201d Well put simply, we just feel like this is a terrific deal for us and capping CBS' losses made sense to us because we believe frankly we have more upside than them. We get more of the risk, and we'll get more of the reward as the nature of our relationship changes considerably over the life of the agreement. As Jeff said, it's going to be a significant factor in our future affiliate fee agreements, and even the number of games moves over time and we'll have 2/3 of the games by the end of the contract. So we're very, very confident in our ability to monetize it, and we feel really good on all fronts.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Mike, did you have another question?", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Yes, the other question would be I know this is another hard question to answer, which is if you back out the NCAA advertising growth this quarter from your domestic ad growth, what would approximate your domestic ad growth close to apples-to-apples as you can get?", "John Martin", "Let me try to help a little bit there and please just know that this requires some forecasting and estimating. So look, I think I said in my proactive remarks, the trends in the first quarter remain very, very strong on an organic basis, and you know that we had strong organic trends in Q4. Much of that continued into Q1. And please appreciate that it really isn't possible to be exactly precise because the NCAA Tournament took up a lot of our prime time in the quarter. And so it displaced the considerable amount of inventory that was programmed differently last year. And as a result of the NCAA, we programmed our networks very differently when you had was type of big, high-profile sporting event. For example, we had significantly fewer originals in the first quarter this year than we did a year ago. On TNT, for example, we had half the number of originals. Last year, we had about 25. This year, we only had about 13. So it's not as simple as just pulling out the NCAA revenue. You have to make a number of estimates. But to just try to be transparent, we're estimating total revenue growth domestically and internationally if you normalize for the NCAA, would be in the high single digits in the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just 2 quick questions. Jeff, last week in an interview, you talked about how you expect Time Warner to exceed everybody's expectations. So I was wondering if you could maybe clarify what you meant by that. And then secondly, given that it seems like you're pretty pleased about the performance of NCAA, was wondering if you could just share with us your thoughts on investing more in sports in the future.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Spencer, I appreciate the question. I think that the comments were taken a little bit out of context, and what the context was, was Charlie Rose and I talking in the Tribeca Film Festival was a question about, \"How do we think about M&A over time versus buybacks?\" And basically, what we were discussing was the fact that there seemed to be pretty widespread concerns about the sustainability of really all the media businesses, including the Time Warner ones and of growth over the long run. So what I was saying was sharing my confidence that given the industries that we operate in and the position we have, the strength of our assets, essentially the very stable and superior performance of all of our businesses in terms of earnings and revenues, did I think that we will continue to grow fairly steadily over the long run. And what I was saying was, if we're right over time and we have been so far, then we will outperform what seemed to be the consensus expectations of not only our company, but most of the media companies over the long run, and that's why we're buying back our stock. I certainly wasn't referring or focusing and certainly, Charlie wasn't asking about this quarter. He's not a financial analyst. In terms of the sports-rights competition, it's a pretty important part of the offering at Turner. But we're focused on having the right sport, and I think John was just explaining the power of NCAA. But let's remember and add to that, that we're very happy with the performance of the NBA, National Basketball, Major League Baseball as well as NCAA. And so we will continue to evaluate potential opportunities in the future. But the way we look at it, the TBS and TNT models are built on a pretty unique and fairly powerful balance of sports, original series and acquired series and some very powerful movies, and we think that's optimized mix to remain pretty attractive not just for viewers and advertisers but for distributors as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis with UBS.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank", "Jeff, can you talk a bit more broadly about your views on syndicated programming and programming costs throughout the exports. Meaning as you acquire more expensive product, is the return on that investment expected to decline? And to what extent do you need to boost in affiliate fees to make the math work?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Syndicated products, series products is getting more and more valuable because there are more buyers. And like for us, we're actually in an ever stronger position, giving the pipeline that we provide to the big 4 American broadcast networks and increasingly all the cable networks. So there's a lot going on there with some of the reality shows going on, broadcast network TV. It makes scripted shows, I think, more valuable. With the retrans support coming to broadcast networks, it makes them a little healthier and able to sustain economics. That's very helpful for not only Warner's, which is the lead supplier for this globally and in the United States. But it also helps our Cable Networks because given our unique position of reach with TBS and TNT, we're one of the biggest buyers and users of hit-series programming. And so for us, the fact that the kind of economic support for making big series and making it available for syndication and then having the 2 of the leading broad-reach networks to program in syndication is a fairly virtuous circle for us. And the international demand, which is increasing for the same product, simply helps us. So overall, it's a fairly strong situation. And I think that everybody ought to rethink, on the positive side, the strength and value of acquired series on syndicated networks.", "John Martin", "The only thing I would add just as a broad generality in terms of returns, I mean our Cable Networks are already our highest return on capital business. And if you look at over the last 3, 4, 5 years fairly consistently, we've been able to grow margins. I mean this year, we've been explicit in saying that we've had a little bit of margin pressure because of the first year of the NCAA contract. But with a 14-year deal, it's going to be a significant source of growth over time and margin enhancement. And I would suspect over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years again, we're going to do to see margin expansion of our Cable Networks, and that's how we're going to approach running.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "You had a follow-up?", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank", "Yes, one quick follow-up. Right at the end of last year, there was a lot talk about some lower-end Cable TV packages, talk about the end of those. Anecdotally, has there been any traction there or not really?", "John Martin", "Well, probably a better question for them than us, but our understanding is no.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tony Wible with Janney.", "Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "I had a question about HBO. I mean it seems like it's doing well. It's selling content, developing new shows. But one of the common criticisms I hear is that HBO will ultimately be undermined by Netflix. That being said, can you expand on your comments to recent film festival welcoming Netflix into the business? It would seem to imply that I guess you see them as maybe more of a complement than a direct threat.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "As you all know, I want to talk about Netflix and I love to talk about HBO. So this is my favorite subject. Let me just clarify our view of subscription VOD and Netflix. Let's start by saying that HBO is a subscription VOD service. So is Netflix, and our view of Netflix has been very consistent. I've tried at times to be humorous about it, sometimes to make a point. So let me try to be clear. We think there's definitely a role for subscription VOD services, library services and Netflix in the ecosystem. And what is the role? Well, clearly, it's a way to give consumers access to a deep library of content that they couldn't easily get before, particularly older shows, although they're probably going to be able to get them more easily in other places now as time goes on. But it's been a useful thing to have subscription services for product that you couldn't get before. It's particularly also had -- I think there's been some utility for viewers in being able to get serialized shows that don't play as well on traditional cable networks or in syndication. So from that point of view, it can be good for consumers. And because SVOD monetizes some content that couldn't be monetized before and it monetizes some content better than it was monetized before, particularly the older library stuff. Then in that sense, you can add money to the ecosystem, and that's good for everybody and performs a useful function. But what we've always said is that as you think of those positives, you need to make sure that SVOD doesn't devalue the content and disrupt the ecosystem. So basically, our view has been that it is not usually the right outlet for the newer higher value content that is functioning much more powerfully for viewers on other kinds of networks in other windows. We have said because of all that, we do not think that it would be a suitable substitute for multichannel TV for most consumers. And therefore, we don't think it'll upend the  multichannel TV business. We've been basically trying to emphasize that point, and so there's been I think a little understandable but somewhat overblown concern about cord cutting. But I'll leave that to further questions.", "Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And if I could follow up, I mean, what gives you confidence I guess about Netflix not displacing the time that consumers have for entertainment? Or any kind of cord shaving or cord cutting?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Yes, okay. Well, thank you for asking. We watch it closely. I'm sure all of you do, but we haven't seen it yet. Let's look at SVOD generally and start with Netflix, which is certainly the leading entity there. I think Netflix has something around 23 million subs in the U.S. We believe there's only about 4 million households that have broadband and no multichannel TV, and that number is almost unchanged over the year since Netflix started its streaming or watch-instantly service. So even though people seem to like the Netflix service, evidenced by the number of subs, it hasn't led to very many Netflix subs cutting the cord. And looking forward, it's hard to see how subscription VOD becomes a replacement for multichannel TV because as far as we can see, it probably won't economically be able to offer a lot of the current shows, sports, live events, first on of things of all kinds that are available on all of the high-value networks. And we don't think there's very many subscribers that are going to be willing to give those things up. And in general, we don't think U.S. consumers want less choice. The record of the last 30, 40 years has been they want more choice. And just to really acid test that, there are already a number of stripped-down TV packages that are available and very few consumers take them. Just take DISH Network has a focus on value. It's lowest priced packaged is $24.99. Most people don't take that, which is why the average revenue at DISH is closer to $70. And then add the last part of the puzzle, which is -- and you can see it this week with HBO GO, TV Everywhere versions, VOD availability for all the networks everybody loves is going to make the current network subscriptions, foremost among them HBO, even more powerful and it fits right into the desire that as SVOD services have shown is a pretty strong desire among consumers. So all this really suggests that things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't in terms of efficiency for all their product, wasn't as available as before. And they're likely to remain complementary to the strong multichannel brands that are getting stronger all the time and that are about to be more available on VOD.", "Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Great, and all those are very great points. I appreciate the feedback.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif-Collins (sic) [Jessica Reif-Cohen] with BAML [Bank of America Merrill Lynch].", "Jessica Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Jeff, I was just wondering if we could go back to your Charlie Rose conversation and talk a little bit about your strategic positioning over the next couple of years. I mean do you feel a need to change your asset mix in any way, whether through acquisition or disposal? I mean do you need more scale internationally or domestically? Do you want complementary assets? Do you really need to own Publishing?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "We don't feel the need, absolutely not the need to change any of the asset mixes. We feel that Publishing is a very strong performer, relative to its competitive set and it's undergoing a pretty interesting upside with the tablets coming along. And so whether it's in Publishing, whether it's Networks, whether it's Film production or TV series production, we're already operating at basically the lead share against all our competition. I'll be then saying, \"Well, what about internet?\" So we don't need to do anything in that area, and we've been opportunistic. We are able to do whatever we would desire to do if it came down to an acquisition, and we don't need to do those if anything comes up in the competitive set. We can afford to pass it, let it go to a competitor and not weaken our competitive position. On the other hand, we, if we acquire something, it probably has more leverage to make it more synergistically a value creation than other buyers. So that's how we look at it. We haven't seen anything that has motivated us lately in those areas. If you go overseas, we have done some acquisitions, and we've done it for a scale to advantage both our strong position with global networks like HBO, which is #1 in every market it operates in; CNN and Cartoon channel (sic) [Cartoon Network], which are usually at the top of the global pack in whatever genre they're serving. And so where we've been mostly had some reasonably significant acquisitions in South America, which has led us to be the #1 network group in South America across all of Latin and Central America. We've done a significant thing in Eastern Europe with CME. We've made some moves in India, which haven't so far performed as well as we'd like. And that's basically what we've done so far.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Miller with Caris & Company.", "David Miller - Caris & Company", "So Jeff, just trying to figure out just given this environment, which on a national basis from an advertising perspective, there's obviously just hugely robust and it's clearly a sellers' market going into the upfront on both broadcast and Cable. I know you can't really prognosticate on what you're going to do in terms of holding back inventory. But in the past, with the environment like this one, a sellers' market where in general, consensus expectations are that you guys are probably going to bag low double-digit CPM growth. What's that threshold that you're comfortable with in terms of holding back inventory if you don't get what you want? Is it 68%, 70%, 75%? Again, I'm not asking you to prognosticate on what you're going to do. I'm just asking on what you've done in the past.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "I'd love to tell you, but I'm not going to tell because we obviously manage that in a fluid market and the Turner asset, I think that's mostly what you're referring to. They are quite good at making that trade-off, and so what I could say generally is that the second quarter ad outlook per [indiscernible] is very healthy. We're seeing 20% to 30% increases over the upfront. Sports has been particularly strong. Some of that comes from the NBA strength that John was mentioning. And remember we displaced those programming a little bit to do that. So that's a bit of a mix issue. As we know, the cancellations have been minimal, and we're going to continue to benefit from the strong upfront pricing that we have. So the pricing should be pretty strong. But as you asked, there's a lot of things to balance in terms of when do you move the price and when do you hold back, and it's really too early to say. I think we'll be at the top of the competitive set in terms of our ad sales performance and our pricing position.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "A question for Jeff and John. Jeff, how does 2Q shake out for a number of original episodes on Turner versus last year, given a lot of series were pushed out of 1Q due to the NCAA?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Wait, what are you asking?", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "I'm just asking how many original TV episodes will be on Turner sort of year-over-year because it drives sensitivity on ad revenue, right? I think in first quarter, you've had a lot fewer original TV episodes on Turner because series were pushed out due to the NCAAs, right?", "John Martin", "So are you asking sequentially or year-over-year?", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "Year-over-year.", "John Martin", "No, in the second quarter?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Second quarter?", "John Martin", "I don't even know right off the top head. I mean my gut reaction would be it'd be roughly comparable. But I just don't know.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Doug, I can probably get to back to you offline. But I don't think we have that.", "John Martin", "Obviously, the first quarter was notable because of the NCAA, which was new. But second quarter, we'll have to get back to you with the details.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "All right. Let me change just my question for Jeff then. Given the comment on SVOD services, library services providing value to consumers, how much upside then is left at Warner Bros. selling library content to Netflix? And I think you've been more conservative than some peers on that.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Well, not really. We already licensed some content to Netflix from Warner's. And we are, and have been, open to the idea of licensing more to whether it's Netflix or other SVOD services, and there are a few rustling around in the forest of things. So we've just been waiting for the right deal. But what we have said is that when we license our content to SVOD services that our priorities are really 2 things. One is maximizing the value of the content. And we think for certain content, SVOD services like Netflix can do that. And also secondly, to make sure we don't damage the ecosystem or devalue our products in the process, we'd like it to be incremental really for any given deal and we'd like it to be incremental in the sense that it establishes a healthy bidding situation for the future.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, and then the question for John. You've mentioned confidence in cash generation capabilities. I think you've ranged between 40% and 50% of EBITDA in the past generated as free cash flow. Is there a percentage that you would suggest investors should think about for 2011 or beyond?", "John Martin", "Well, I think for 2011 specifically, we haven't given direct guidance. We did say that conversion would be down somewhat as compared to last year. There's a number of reasons why. I think cash tax is being up is one big reason why. The second big reason, if you look at -- and we've said that we expect a record operating profit performance at Warner Bros. this year. So clearly, a portion of that growth is coming from syndication revenues and profits being recognized where we'll receive cash over time over the life of the agreement, whereas the accounting rules require that you recognize the revenue upon availability, which would be this year. So I think it's better to talk about the longer term, which is next 2, 3, 4, 5 years. We have said that conversion should go up again beginning next year. And I think if you look at just the free cash flow generation capability of our businesses, we don't see any difference looking back as to looking forward. In other words, we don't anticipate that the capital intensity is going to change very much. We don't anticipate that our conversions will be the depressed on any long-term sustainable basis. So we continue to believe that we're going to continue to generate free cash flow at very, very healthy percentages.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "I just want to add one thing. Maybe it's what you're asking. If you were trying to -- remember that the original series on Turner will pick up in the summer. They will. So that is true that in this summer season, we have a lot of our originals coming back, and the Turner Network has a big success running with not only Closer but Rizzoli & Isles and several new shows that they launched.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "Two questions. One, you said last week that movies do most of their business in the first few weeks after their release, then they're out of the theaters generally. Wondering why then the premium VOD window you're putting at 8 weeks versus at 4, which will probably get a lot more traction from a consumer standpoint. Two, do you see any benefits to splitting off HBO? It seems to be an asset that's pretty undervalued within Time Warner, and was curious how you think about pursuing that type of a strategy especially if parts of HBO might not always align with other initiatives at Time Warner's other businesses.", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "I'll come back to HBO. But actually, they do align with the other businesses. But let's start with the first one. If your question was, \"If it's good to release films earlier by, whenever, 8 or some weeks out, why not release them earlier still?\" It's not clear yet if the trade-offs for both viewers, people that buy tickets and go to movies, and the whole infrastructure of exhibition that needs to support that, really is a valid one even at 8 weeks out. So we're going to have to see. We're doing a test to see what demand does it fulfill, to what extent does it under mark ticket sales, which we don't intend. But it does that. If it does that, it'll be something that we all have to rethink. As you move it closer, which I believe was your question, you simply exacerbate that, and it doesn't really seem at this point to be necessary. So it may not be necessary even to the extent that the test is pegged at 8 weeks out. So we'll see. It's a little early to say. What nobody wants to do is really cannibalize the theatrical window. That's a legitimate concerns the exhibitors have, and it's a concern that we share with them. So that's so far the answer to that. On the HBO one, thanks Rich. I've enjoyed and admired a lot of the stuff that you've been writing about. I mean I think everybody enjoys reading these thoughts because a lot of them are very forward thinking. I'd have to say in this case, it doesn't make any sense to us to consider spinning off HBO. I think you're right that if HBO is valued or thought to have the challenges that some have asked, they're not getting it as they saw in droves over the many years I've been associated with HBO. HBO's in a really strong position. You should watch what happens with GO this week and begin to appreciate that. And so if you say, \"Well, why should we have it?\" Well, we love having HBO. It's a strong performer. It aligns really well with the scale of our other networks. I don't suppose it's really appreciated out there, the extent to which we do benefit from the leverage of having the Turner Networks and HBO both here and overseas. So that's one thing. We like the business in itself. That's the second thing. We don't think it's going to be viewed more valuably separate than part of us. That'd be the third thing. We do have a very strong relationship with Warner as we have always had. It wouldn't be any better or worse if it were a separate company than it is together. In fact, we think there've been a lot of advantages running both ways at Warner and at HBO from being able to look at the world together because what happens in pay TV is that we look out about 10 years, and we always have the evidence of our VOD position, and the invention of VOD inside Time Warner proves that. It wouldn't have any effect on bidding for movies. And finally, it's not HBO's intent. It never has been to prevent consumers from accessing their legitimately purchased content. It's pretty clear that Warner's has been one of the leaders of making digital purchase more valuable and efficient for consumers. HBO has been a part of that and knows about it.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "Do you see any way that HBO could go direct to the consumer then without having to go through a multichannel operator?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "Well, as we have said, HBO does have the ability to do that, and the reason that we have not done it has to with the interests as HBO assesses, nothing to do with any conflict with any other part of Time Warner. If it is worthwhile and thought by both HBO and us here at Time Warner to be a wise thing to do, we'd do it. And it doesn't really conflict with any other part of our company.", "Operator", "The last question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Jeff and John, can you talk a little bit about Turner, the programming investment strategy and the programming investment growth through the year, excluding the Tournament, just sort of on a normalized basis. And I'm asking in the context of the ratings at TNT and TBS, and I'd love to hear you talk about where the weakness is coming from, if it's original, is there syndicated content; and if that changes, how you think about the mix going into future seasons. And if you're thinking at all about what might happen if there's no NBA season next year -- I think the bargaining agreement expires in July 1, I think, and certainly there could be a lost season or at least a delay. How does that impact things?", "Jeffrey Bewkes", "And I think I'll start. John'll see most of it. I think the ratings were a mixed bag. So we need to be careful focusing too much on the ratings, and I think maybe your question understood that because the ratings are an important indicator. But they're not the only indicator. And we always talk about programming for profits, which means we prioritize getting the right mix of programming as you asked and the one that's valued by consumers and advertisers and distribution partners, all mixing the right balance of revenues and costs. So the way to basically look at that it's not all ratings points are created equal. If you dissect the ratings, I'd say the trends this quarter are consistent with what we've seen for a while. I'll just start, and then John'll pick up with the facts. In sports, as you know, we had very strong sports programming. NCAA viewership was up 7% over last year, and it was the highest-rated Tournament since '05. The NBA's been very strong. That's in sports. In originals, they did well in the quarter. But given that we had more mix devoted, of air time to sports as you and someone else have asked, we have fewer originals in the quarter, and we'll have more of them in the next quarter. For acquired series, we have seen some weakness in some of our acquired series. It's been going on for a while. Some of that is because we've had a couple of aging acquired series that aren't performing as well as we expected like Bones. And some of it is because some of the shows we've had have been showing up on other services like SVOD, which we think has hurt them. And we think that what we've got to elevate the performance of acquired series is we've got Big Bang Theory coming to TBS, and we have The Mentalist coming to TNT. And we think that should add a significant impact, and we have some sports playoffs coming this spring and originals this summer, which in the short run should lift the ratings. But John, you have. . .", "John Martin", "Just I think -- this'll actually be quick. But I mean clearly, our programming expense growth in the first quarter is going to be highest year-over-year growth percentage of the year. And I think we've been pretty clear as to why that was, and that was all planned for. Coming into this year, what we said was if you set aside for a moment NCAA Tournament, all of the rest of our programming would be up in the high single digits, and we continue to believe -- I mean that is what's is going to happen. Remember, all of these costs are under our control and largely planned for well in advance. And so in the first quarter, we have the NCAA, which was a considerable percentage of the overall growth. In addition, we had some incremental investment in the higher profile programming that wasn't there a year ago including Conan. We did on the Cartoon Network the Hall of Game. We had some incremental investments in series like Southland. But if you look at all other programming costs growth beyond that, it was up in the mid-single digits. So I feel really good about our ability to control the cost growth and plan for it and do it with within the architecture of how to grow earnings over time, where we know where what subscription revenue growth is going to be, and we've got a pretty good guess as to what ad revenue is going to be. So hopefully, that's helpful.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Yes, any contingency plans on the NBA if that doesn't happen from a programming perspective?", "John Martin", "Not that we'd be willing to share on the call.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "John Martin", "Right, but we have.", "Douglas Shapiro", "All right. I think that's it for us, but thank you very much for dialing in.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

I will now turn the call over to Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the call.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results in the fourth quarter and full year, and the other providing our 2012 business outlook. ", "Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site. ", "And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. ", "These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ", "Thank you, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Good morning, and thanks for listening in. We had a great fourth quarter, capping another great year. In 2011, we grew revenue 8%. That's our highest rate since 2003. We grew adjusted operating income 9%, and we grew adjusted earnings per share 20%, exceeding our guidance. In fact, we've more than doubled our adjusted EPS over the last 3 years. ", "We had a strong year operationally, too. We not only maintained our leading position across almost all of our businesses, in most cases we took share. We're at the vanguard of the industry in advancing the next generation of digital business models, and we expanded our international presence. ", "At the same time, we significantly increased our returns to shareholders. We directed $5.6 billion to dividends and to stock repurchases, buying back 12% of our shares in just one year. And in 2012, we plan to keep the momentum going. We'll drive to deliver double-digit growth in adjusted EPS again, and we also just raised our dividend by 11% and announced a new $4-billion repurchase authorization. ", "We intend to achieve our financial goals while remaining as focused as ever on our key strategic priorities: first, invest aggressively to create and acquire the best content; second, accelerate new business models that harness technology to improve the consumer experience, but in a way that supports our economics; third, expand internationally in key territories; and fourth, continuously work to improve both our operating and our capital efficiency. ", "Let me tell you how we're pursuing these objectives at each of our divisions in 2012, starting with Networks. At Turner, we'll keep ratcheting up our investment in content as we seek the optimal mix of sports, originals and acquired programming. For instance, 2011 was the first year of our 14-year agreement to air the NCAA men's basketball tournament with CBS. It outperformed our expectations on every count in 2011: viewership, digital metrics, sponsorships and ad revenue. The 2012 tournament is just around the corner, and we are very pleased with advertiser demand as we head into the tournament. ", "We're also excited to have the NBA back on TNT. We've seen extremely strong ratings so far, and every indication is that the lockout did not diminish fans' enthusiasm at all. For 2012, we'll increase investment in original programming again. At TNT, we'll bring back some of the biggest shows on ad-supported cable, like the final season of the of The Closer; the next season of Rizzoli & Isles; and the #1 new drama on cable last year, Falling Skies. ", "Starting this summer, we'll debut several new shows, including our highly anticipated reboot of Dallas, as well as Major Crimes, Perception and The Great Escape. You'll also see more original programming on the TBS prime time lineup later this year. And in 2012, we'll build on the momentum of our original programming at truTV and on Adult Swim. Both of these networks are coming off record years for viewership. ", "And last but not least, we expect another strong year at CNN. In 2011, CNN was up more than 20% in its key demo, driven by the news cycle and by our programming moves over the past year. That momentum should serve CNN very well as we head into an election year. ", "We're refreshing our acquired programming on TBS and TNT in 2012 also, particularly in the key prime time period. Prime time in sports is where our entertainment networks generate the highest volumes and the highest pricing. ", "In October, we put The Big Bang Theory into its regular spot on the TBS prime time schedule, and it has been a runaway hit. It drove a big ratings improvement across the whole network in the fourth quarter, and that momentum is continuing. In January, TBS was up 30% in prime time, posting its highest ratings ever and making it the #1 entertainment network on cable.", "At HBO in 2012, we'll bring back the biggest hits on premium TV. In their most recent season, True Blood attracted 13 million viewers per episode, Game of Thrones attracted 9 million and Boardwalk Empire attracted 8 million. Considering HBO is in 28 million homes, that kind of share is unmatched anywhere on television. In HBO homes, those are 30s and 40s. We're also excited about several new shows on HBO. Two weeks ago, we premiered Luck, a new show from David Milch and Michael Mann, starring Dustin Hoffman, which has received fantastic critical reviews. And later this year, we'll debut the Newsroom from Aaron Sorkin and a host of other new shows. We also will expand the slate of original shows on Cinemax this year.", "In 2012, our networks will continue to be at the forefront of TV Everywhere. Two years ago, TV Everywhere, what many call authentication, was only an idea, with no technology underlying it and no industry support. It's come a long way. Today, authenticated TV has been embraced by every major distributor and program. Until now, we've been chiefly focused on availability of TV Everywhere. Now it's time for the whole industry to drive consumer awareness and consumer usage. ", "To really excite consumers, we think TV Everywhere needs to be easy: easy to access and easy to use. It needs to offer a robust amount of content for every network, and it needs to be on multiple devices, including connected televisions. HBO GO is a great example. It has millions of active users. Consumer satisfaction scores are through the roof, and we're seeing a big increase in the monthly viewing. And that's before we have a meaningful presence for these apps on everybody's television set, and that will happen soon. ", "During the fourth quarter, we signed agreements at HBO with both Time Warner Cable and Cablevision that will bring availability of HBO GO and MAX GO to essentially all of HBO's domestic sub base. And the HBO GO app will soon be available on the Xbox, and we'll continue to roll out apps for more connected devices throughout the year. ", "At Turner, we're now making almost 1,000 hours of on-demand TV Everywhere content and live feeds of CNN and Headline News available to almost 80 million homes. We've rolled out apps for all our major networks. And in 2012, we'll add more content and support more devices, including connected TVs. ", "Our networks are also growing at a rapid clip internationally. At Turner, our international operations grew to 20% of revenue in 2011. That's up from 18% in 2010. We saw a very strong performance in Latin America, in particular, where we're now the largest provider of multi-channel TV networks. We experienced very strong growth internationally at HBO, too. Including our joint ventures in Latin America and Asia, both subscribers and revenue increased well over 20% in 2011. ", "In 2012, HBO will launch new premium networks in several territories, including HBO Netherlands this week. We'll increase international local production and roll out new features at our international networks like high-def and on-demand. ", "We've now launched HBO GO as an authenticated service in 8 countries. And this year, we're shooting to complete our rollout across Central Europe and across Latin America. When including HBO Latin America and HBO Asia, our combined international network businesses at Turner and HBO generated over $3 billion of revenue and over $650 million of adjusted operating income in 2011. And as we told you last year, our goal is to reach $1 billion in operating profits at our international networks by 2014. ", "I'll turn next to Warner Bros., where we will also be investing to press our competitive advantages. Our film division had another great year in 2011, surpassing $4 billion at the global box office for the third consecutive time thanks to successful event films like The Hangover 2; Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, which is currently tracking for $0.5 billion in global box; and of course, the last Harry Potter. ", "As I mentioned to you last quarter, we expect the Harry Potter franchise to endure long after the last movie release. In December, we reached agreements with Universal Studios to expand The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando and to bring a new attraction to Los Angeles. These deals call for a significant increase in license fees starting in 2014. ", "We're excited about our event film slate in 2012, too. Just like you, we're eagerly awaiting the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises, which is already selling out midnight IMAX shows in July; and the first installment of The Hobbit coming this year; as well as Dark Shadows from Tim Burton and Johnny Depp; and a movie called Gravity, with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. ", "At Warners' television production arm, after a terrific 2011, we are ramping up investment again in 2012. We're continuing to see very favorable demand trends. The broadcast and cable networks are increasing investment in original scripted TV. There's strong demand for the biggest hits coming off broadcast into syndication. We're still seeing international license fees climb, even in Europe. And of course, there's new demand from SVOD providers, both here and overseas. ", "On top of those secular trends, Warners has had a really strong first half in the 2011-2012 season. We're seeing fantastic performance from a number of our returning shows, including Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and Mike & Molly. And we have several freshmen hits, such as 2 Broke Girls, Suburgatory, Person of Interest and Alcatraz. These shows will pay dividends for years to come as they enter the syndication market. ", "Last year, Warner Home Entertainment had another standout year in a very challenging environment. We were #1 again across every home entertainment category and once again grew our share. This performance reflects the advantages of our scale, the demand for our event films even as consumers have become more selective, and it reflects the benefits of some of the steps we've taken to establish new windows. ", "In particular, in 2010, we instituted a 28-day window for kiosk and DVD-by-mail services. That enabled our titles last year to significantly outperform comparable titles released by other studios without a window. In 2012, we'll keep pushing to define the next generation of business models for home entertainment. As part of that, we're using windows to advantage our higher contribution distribution channels. ", "Last month, we announced an agreement with Netflix to extend the 28-day window for DVD-by-mail to 56 days. We'll keep working to extend the window for kiosk providers and for brick-and-mortar retailers, too. We're also trying to make digital ownership much more compelling for consumers. That's why we've been a big supporter of UltraViolet. Warners was the first studio to release UV titles, and Flixster was the first service to allow consumers to access them. All of our new releases on DVD and Blu-ray are now UV compatible. We're looking forward to more studios releasing more UV titles and more retailers supporting the standard over the course of the year. It's certainly early, but the consumer response we've seen so far reinforces how much pent-up demand exists for an easy way to manage and access digital movie collections. ", "Turning to Publishing. Time Inc. continues to be the clear leader in its industry despite a tough environment. In 2011, it took share for the third consecutive year, creating the widest gap over #2 competitor in 5 years. In 2012, we'll remain focused on continuing to grow our share and tightly manage our cost structure. ", "Like our other divisions, Time Inc. is pushing the digital evolution of its businesses more aggressively than any of its competitors. For instance, we've now launched tablet editions for all of our domestic titles. We're convinced that the tablet will offer more value to both our readers and our advertisers. And if the model develops properly, it should enhance traditional magazine economics. ", "That's one reason why I'm thrilled that we were able to bring on Laura Lang as the new Time Inc. CEO. Laura's leadership experience and her knowledge of the intersection of marketing and digital make her the perfect executive to lead that charge.  ", "Next, John will discuss our financial results, including the fourth objective I mentioned earlier: improving our operating and capital efficiency. ", "Before I hand it off, I want to take a step back. We're only 2 years into our life as a smaller content-focused company. They've been 2 really good years, but I think our best years are ahead of us. The digital transition is driving higher usage across our businesses, and it's increasing the value of the high-quality content that we specialize in. New opportunities are opening up for us, technologically and geographically. We are focused on being able to capitalize on those opportunities, and we are in a better position than ever to do that. ", "And with that, I'll turn it over to John.", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm going to begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. ", "As we headed into 2011, we discussed with you our plans to be more aggressive in pursuing our goals of investment, growth and returns. We achieved or exceeded our targets on all counts here. We grew revenues 8%, the highest growth rate since 2003, and we grew adjusted operating income 9% to a record $5.9 billion. That translated to 20% growth in adjusted EPS to $2.89, also the highest amount in the company's history. And as Jeff mentioned, over the past 3 years, adjusted EPS has now more than doubled. And we achieved these results while investing even more in our businesses to strengthen their competitive position and drive long-term growth. ", "In 2011, we increased investment in programming and production and marketing in the high single digits while reallocating resources away from less productive areas like G&A. Notwithstanding these significant investments, we were able to maintain very high levels of returns on invested capital. And as the way we look at it, which exclude certain purchase price adjustments, our return on invested capital was at about 20% in 2011. ", "And at the same time, we accelerated our direct returns to shareholders. And between dividends and share repurchases, we returned $5.6 billion. In 2012, our goal of once again delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth reflects confidence in continued growth despite the uncertain economic environment, current volatility and some difficult growth comparisons. And we remain committed to direct returns to shareholders, as evidenced by our board's decision to both increase the dividend by 11% and to authorize a new $4-billion share repurchase program. ", "Turning to the next slide, I'll quickly take you through the quarter, where we had the highest levels of revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS in the company's history. As we expected, the fourth quarter was our strongest in terms of year-over-year growth in both adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS. It was the ninth straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, including growth across all sources of revenue. ", "Adjusted operating income was up 20%, with margins expanding nearly 300 basis points, and adjusted EPS grew 40% year-over-year in the quarter. In addition to the strong growth in adjusted operating income, the EPS growth was helped by having fewer shares outstanding due to our ongoing repurchases, as well as a lower tax rate. ", "So let me turn now to our divisional results, and let me begin with the Networks group, where the fourth quarter was very strong and it was a strong end to what was a really, really good year. For the year, we grew revenues 9%, with solid revenue growth at both HBO and Turner, and we grew adjusted operating income mid-single digits, and that's despite the effect of the first year of the NCAA basketball tournament. ", "In the fourth quarter, we posted the highest growth in adjusted operating income of any quarter in the year. Advertising revenues grew a modest 2% in the quarter, and that growth was negatively impacted by the NBA lockout, lower scatter demand and lower ratings at TNT, as well as foreign currency translation. At our international networks, advertising revenue growth was up in the high single digits, and that included about a 400-basis-point drag from currency translation. We continue to see strong growth in our European and Latin American entertainment businesses. ", "In 2012, advertising growth is tracking somewhere around the mid-single digits. That reflects positive rating trends at most of our networks, particularly TBS. Scatter pricing is up solidly over upfront levels, although volume remains relatively behind recent years. Advertising growth also reflects the ratings challenges that I just mentioned at TNT, as well as the lingering effect of the NBA work stoppage. While the fan and the viewer response to the return of the NBA has been very strong and very encouraging, some of the advertising dollars that are usually spent there were committed elsewhere during the lockout period. And we fully expect that to be a temporary effect that will be resolved by returning to a normal selling cycle. ", "Moving over to subscription revenues at the Networks, which grew 5% in the quarter and 6% for the year. Similar to what we discussed with you last quarter, certain affiliate fee adjustments in the fourth quarter and the prior year reduced growth by about 1 percentage point in the fourth quarter. ", "Looking over at the content revenue, sales of HBO original programming drove another year of strong growth in 2011. That included the second cycle syndication of Sex and the City and the international licensing of Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones. ", "Looking at HBO subscriber base for a moment, domestic subscribers increased nearly 200,000 for the year, and that was despite flat multi-channel households, as well as continued losses at a couple of major domestic affiliates. This year, in 2012, we're optimistic that we'll see improved trends at each of these distributors. As Jeff mentioned, we're also really pleased that HBO GO and MAX GO will now be available to nearly all domestic subscribers. And we believe that this will both extend the life cycle of existing subscribers, as well as help attract new subscribers. HBO also grew its international subscriber base by over 25% to end the year at about 53 million, so the global subscriber base now at HBO is around 93 million subs. ", "Adjusted operating income at the Networks group segment increased 27% in the fourth quarter, with margins expanding nearly 600 basis points year-over-year. Growth here was boosted by the timing of programming and marketing expenses, which were down from the fourth quarter of 2010. And for the year, programming expenses increased 12%, and we've discussed that with you in the past. Excluding the impact of the NCAA basketball tournament, underlying programming expenses would have been up in the mid-single digits, which is right on expectations. ", "For 2012, we're looking forward to another great year at the Networks group. We expect healthy subscription revenue growth despite the likelihood that currency is going to be a headwind, particularly in the first half of the year. And while we don't have a crystal ball on advertising, we are cautiously optimistic here. We had a very, very strong 2011, 2012 upfront, and advertisers continue to focus their spending on national television. ", "On the cost side, this will be the second year of the NCAA men's basketball tournament on our network, so we don't have the same challenging cost growth comparisons that we did a year ago. And while we'll keep increasing investment in programming in a controlled way, we'll fund that in part by limiting growth in non-revenue-generating expenses. So putting that all together, we anticipate the Networks group, the profit will grow faster this year in 2012 than it did in 2011. ", "Let me turn now to film, where Warner Bros. had its best year ever in 2011. Revenues were up 9%. Adjusted operating income grew 16% to a record of nearly $1.3 billion. Warner Bros. had the biggest box office hit and the most successful home video release of the year with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It also had the biggest syndicated hit on television with Big Bang Theory, which is now the #1 comedy in television syndication. And it also had one of the most successful video game releases of the year with Batman: Arkham City. So 2012 will obviously have difficult comparisons to the record 2011 performance, which may result in lower profits this year compared to last year. ", "Industry home video trends remain challenging. However, we still believe that it's going to be a very strong year at this division. At the end of 2011, for example, backlog reached around $5.5 billion, and that's the highest year-end level ever. And it's up close to 35% from just 3 years ago. Backlog is the amount of unrecognized cash licensing revenue for television and theatrical product. And although all of that won't be recognized in 2012, it's an important indicator of future revenue pipeline. ", "We're also optimistic about our film slate this year, as Jeff described, and we should also have another strong year at the TV studio as well. We're continuing to see strong demand across all end markets: broadcast, cable, domestic and international syndication, and SVOD. And we'll benefit from another solid lineup of the syndication pipeline, which this year includes The Mentalist. So tough comps aside, it should be a great year at Warner Bros. ", "Over at Publishing. In 2011, Time Inc. posted double-digit profit growth in the quarter and the year. Advertising revenues were flat in the quarter and slightly down for the year. Subscription revenues were also down 2% for both the quarter and the full year, and most of that was due to continued softness at the newsstand, particularly in the celebrity category. ", "Looking into the first quarter, we're seeing continued softness in both advertising revenues and newsstand sales. Adjusted operating income was up 23% in the quarter, with margins up 400 basis points, though much of that growth was due to lower restructuring and severance costs. For the year, margins grew 150 basis points, and that's the highest level since 2007. ", "2012, we continue to expect a challenging revenue environment, and we'll be making investments in tablet initiatives, as well as experiencing increased physical costs like postage and paper. All of that could make profit growth here at this division difficult. ", "Turning to the next slide. 2012, let me provide some context for the outlook this year. We fully expect to see longer-term secular strength in most of our businesses. Demand for high-quality content is increasing. TV advertising is taking share, and international opportunities are expanding. So we're investing aggressively against these significant opportunities, particularly in original programming and our company-wide Content Everywhere strategy. ", "We'll also invest in our enterprise efficiency initiatives, which are focused principally in the areas of real estate and information technology. As part of that drive, we anticipate corporate expenses will actually trend somewhat higher this year. We're doing that, though, with an aim to generate material recurring annual savings over time once these initiatives are fully implemented. ", "We're also doing all that against a backdrop of what is the uncertain macroeconomic environment, and we expect that there could be some volatility in exchange rate changes. And in fact, at current rates, FX translation could be a drag of about 200 basis points on growth in adjusted operating income in 2012. ", "We have a lot riding on the success of our film slate this year, although we've said we're very optimistic. And all of this that I just described perhaps makes forecasting a little harder this year than it has been over the past several years. But nevertheless, we're setting a goal for ourselves, and we expect to post double-digit adjusted EPS growth again this year. ", "One housekeeping note. As you think about the progression of the quarter, similar to what happened in 2011, keep in mind that we have difficult content comps at Networks in the first quarter. And our film profitability will likely be heavily weighted towards the back half of the year as it was, as I mentioned, in 2011 due to the timing of theatrical and home video releases. ", "Turning now to the next slide, which details free cash flow. 2011, we delivered approximately $2.7 billion, and that was higher than we anticipated when we came into the year. And that was the result of very strong free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter. In 2012, we expect the conversion ratio of free cash to be in the same range as it was in 2011. Our use of working capital should be somewhat lower than it was in 2011, but we expect that to be somewhat offset by higher cash taxes and higher cash interest. And that's due to the debt that we issued last year. ", "So let me end with the final slide, which shows a reconciliation of our net debt balance. We ended 2011 with $16 billion in net debt, and that was up about $3.2 billion compared to the end of 2010, and it was up about $750 million compared to the third quarter. Our leverage ratio is now close to our target of 2.5x. That's up from around 2x at the end of 2010, and it was the result of an effort to improve our capital structure. We achieved that by spending $5.6 billion on share repurchases and dividends, and that's up 80% from 2010 levels and was more than double our free cash flow generation in 2011. We also spent a little under $400 million on M&A actions. In addition, we took advantage of market conditions last year to strengthen our balance sheet by raising long-term debt and amending our $5-billion revolving bank credit facility, which reduced annual cost and extended terms. ", "So if you look back over the past 3 years, the approach that we've taken has really been one of balance and consistency. And since 2008, we have generated around $8 billion in free cash flow. We've paid out close to $3 billion in dividends. We've repurchased almost $8 billion of our shares or 20% of the base, and we've made $2-billion worth of acquisitions. At the same time, we remained very, very focused on maintaining our balance sheet strength and retaining flexibility. ", "This year, our philosophy of capital deployment will not change. We're going to continue to look for the right balance between maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet, while actively deploying our capital to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and deliver returns to shareholders. We continue to believe that a target leverage of 2.5x is the level that best balances all of these aims and goals. ", "So you could see from our continued commitment to direct returns in the board's decision to increase the dividend and authorize the new share repurchase program. But now that we have reached the target leverage, the excess capital that we're going to deploy will be primarily determined by the growth in our businesses and our free cash flow generation. So as of now, we expect buyback levels in 2012 to be lower than they were in 2011. ", "Now let me turn the call back over to Doug to begin the Q&A portion of this phone call. Thank you very much.", "Douglas Shapiro", "All right. Thanks, John. Christine, can we get the Q&A started? [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Spencer Wang from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I have one for Jeff and one for John. Jeff, on some of the new technology initiatives, I was wondering if -- with HBO GO, if you've seen that help the churn numbers. And if so, if you could maybe quantify that. And on UltraViolet, would you consider an earlier UltraViolet window to stimulate UV sales? And then secondly, for John, I know at cable networks, you said the margin sounds like they'll be up year-over-year. Should we expect programming cost growth then to be around mid-single digits?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I think your first question was HBO churn?", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Right, from HBO GO.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We're really happy with the user data and the satisfaction letters -- levels that we're getting. The subs really like it. Viewership is up a fair amount in the homes that are using GO. It's pretty early to tell exactly what that will do mathematically to the churn across the base. So we expect it will be sometime before we start to get a real sense of that. But GO basically, it obviously makes it easier to watch HBO. It brings new subs in and extends the life of existing subs. So it's going to be an increasing net positive. Think of it really as what we've already seen at HBO over the years on Video on Demand, which raised the viewing and helped stabilize the sub base. Same thing with GO. And then what should make that even more powerful is when more and more affiliates put HBO GO across all devices. There's been a little friction and not as much speed as we would like in having all of our subscribers to HBO get GO on every kind of device. On the early window for electronic sell-through, we're evolving the windows all the time. And as you know, we've had some efforts on rental which are more like tests. The powerful thing would be to have that electronic sell-through start earlier. And one of the issues for that is really the security of the television. And as the ability to secure the early release gets more -- when we get more confident in that, I think that the whole industry will move towards earlier sell-through. But not -- we don't see any reason that, that has or will cannibalize theatrical. And we think it can fit in correctly with the current retail distribution system that you have for physical.", "John K. Martin", "Spencer, it's John. Your question regarding programming cost and network margins. For 2012, I think it's going to be pretty consistent with what we've done over the past 3 to 5 years. Think about programming cost increases going up in a controlled way, mid to high single digits. Remember, it's an election year. We'll spend a little bit more at CNN for news gathering costs. There'll be an increased investment in original programming to try to take advantage of our lead positions. And like we've done in the past, we're going to continue to shoot for all other costs at the Networks division, including marketing, SG&A, overhead, other back-office-related costs -- those are going to grow at a much slower rate. So those will grow sort of low to mid. So that on a combined basis, overall expense growth should be mid-single digits, and we would anticipate margin improvement.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG Research.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on the last question because I think it's important. When you look at the goal of getting TV Everywhere to the television, some of your biggest distributors like Comcast, Time Warner Cable and DirecTV have all decided that HBO GO isn't going to be accessible for right now on devices like the Roku. And it's unclear what they will or won't allow in the future. They seem to cite customer data retention or viewership information as an issue here. Just wondering if you could give us your sense of kind of how this gets worked out and how the industry is going to get comfortable with this, because it seems like getting into the television is what has made Netflix so successful, and it seems like what it will really drive HBO GO's success, as well as other of your TV Everywhere platforms. And then just a quick follow-up. In the press release, you cite licensing profits from Turner for both Q4 and 2011 drivers. Can you just give us a little sense on what was in there?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I'm glad you asked us both of those. So let's go to the first one. Frankly, I don't understand the reticence of distributors to authenticate on third-party sites like Roku and get HBO and TNT and all of those channels to television. As a general principle, we, as an industry, should be making viewers have availability with on-demand TV of all of their favorite networks on any platform, any device that they want to use. And what's kind of powerful about it, and I think it's in your question, is that by authenticating TV Everywhere, basically that whatever network you like on all devices and platforms, cable operators would be making the video subscription they sell to consumers enormously more valuable. They would, therefore, make it much less likely that a consumer would cut the cord. They would basically bring on stream all those younger people that are wondering whether they're ever going to subscribe to cable. And so by providing ubiquitous access to TV channels on demand, they would diminish the relative value of over-the-top services or SVOD services that are really nothing more than the same programming offered on demand in a later window. So as an industry, and I'm speaking now for all our networks, we've got great, fresh, really popular programs. We ought to make it available to our viewers on all their devices on demand, as easily as we can at no extra charge. All the -- that's how you fulfill the promise of your brands and of television to viewers. And I'm hopeful that the industry will move pretty quickly past some of its -- I think their more minor concerns that they have, and they ought to speed up.", "John K. Martin", "Rich, it's John. On your licensing revenue question, I think that the press release highlights the content revenues from HBO and licensing from Turner. It's really \"normal course of business\" type of stuff. There's nothing notable in there. It's the type of licensing revenues that we generated on an annual recurring basis from Cartoon Network, merchandising and licensing of our properties there, as well as some NCAA stuff.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen from Bank of America.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have 2 questions. One, John, I just wanted to review what's in the guidance really quickly. I think you said you were cautiously optimistic regarding advertising, and I was wondering if you could just maybe size it. Does that mean mid-single digits or high single digits affiliate fees? It kind of sounded like mid to high. And then what is in -- would you encompass, like SVOD deals for -- well, SVOD deals for Warner Bros. in that guidance? And the second question -- Jeff, I'm sorry -- Jeff said that there would be a meaningful increase in Harry Potter license fee beginning in 2014. So I'm just wondering if you could size that. How meaningful of an increase and what is your share or what is your split with J.K. Rowling?", "John K. Martin", "I'll start, Jessica. Look, on the guidance, we're not going to give specific forward-looking guidance on a line-by-line basis. And my cautious optimism, I think, is a reflection of the fact that we are planning to see an acceleration from Q4 to Q1 as it relates to ad revenue. We are seeing scatter pricing up nicely over upfront pricing levels. In the upfront, as I mentioned, we were up low double digits in pricing. The volume has been a little bit light. And certain categories, such as packaged goods, have been a little bit light. So I mean, there's some mixed signals there. But we've got ratings momentum at most of our networks, which we're actually quite pleased about, and it's not just TBS. It's Cartoon Network, which has been up nicely. It's CNN. It's truTV. And we're optimistic that TNT's ratings are going to improve as we progress through this year. On the subscription revenue side, which has been an amazingly consistent revenue line for us, the networks where we've got about $8.2 billion of annual revenues, I think what we've said in the past continues to hold true, which is that we're experiencing about mid-single-digit pricing increases across the board. In part, the subscriber revenue levels will depend on whether we get unit growth, particularly in the U.S., because we anticipate getting unit growth outside of the U.S. And then FX, which -- FX, over the last several months, has moved around quite a bit. Right now, it looks like it's a drag, but who knows what happens going forward? But the fundamentals of the subscription revenue growth is still very strong, and we did experience the high single-digit growth at Turner a year ago that we predicted. And we think for the sustainable future, it's going to be a strong revenue generation source for us. And remember, all of this is before we'd see a meaningful acceleration from the NCAA. As it relates to SVOD deals, I'm not going to be specific. We had -- in 2011, I think I might have mentioned on the last quarter's call, we had revenues recognized in the fourth quarter that were -- that was a little north of $100 million. And from the deals we've announced, we expect at least that same level in 2012, but we've got numerous discussions occurring with multiple SVOD providers. And what's very clear is there's a fair bit of demand out there. And frankly, Warner Bros. has the deepest, richest and broadest library of both films and TV shows. So we're quite confident in our ability to monetize that in a value-accretive way going forward.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Let me just add -- John just said it. Warners has 6,000 films and over 75,000 TV episodes, so we're feeling pretty good about that situation. I think you asked about Harry Potter parks, if I understood the question. And we're really excited about the new agreement that we have with Universal. It's a great example of how Harry Potter is going to live on and be vibrant in coming years. It's going to include taking the Wizarding World of Harry Potter to Universal Los Angeles, and we're going to expand the widely successful gate in Orlando. We think it really is promising. It highlights the power of Harry Potter and really of any great franchise. And we will start, and I think this goes to your question, to recognize the revenue from that once the parks open. So that's a few years off. I shouldn't forget, we're also opening up The Making of Harry Potter this March at our studio outside of London. And there are many other international theme park locations you're all well aware of, all of which represent big opportunities for Harry Potter, but we don't -- we're not ready to announce those yet.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura Securities.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I have a couple of housekeeping questions for John. So, John, on affiliate fees in Networks, can you give us the detail between, in this quarter, domestic affiliate fee growth and international fees? You gave it for advertising. I want to get it for affiliate fee growth.", "John K. Martin", "Sure, Michael. Let's start with the bigger picture, and then we'll drill down. So affiliate fees in the fourth quarter grew about 5% at the Networks. And that was, I think as I had mentioned in my proactive remarks, held back about 100 basis points or so from some, what I'd call ordinary types of adjustments that would have occurred in HBO. And FX as well. Thanks, Doug. In addition, so if you look at the breakout between domestic and international, we saw domestic affiliate fee growth of around 4%, and international was about 3x that. If you look, though, more broadly over the year, which I think is a more relevant barometer than any one particular quarter, basically, our international growth is growing at about twice the level as our domestic growth. And I think it pretty much holds true that if you look at -- we grew affiliate revenue about 6.5% at the Networks and that was about 5% -- a little more -- around 5% domestic, and then international was high teens. And then averaged out overall, as I said, on the ad side, international growing much faster than domestic and around twice the level.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then, John, on cash flow, you gave us a lot of detail. If you look at your Slide 11, something that jumped out at us was the difference between cash interest and P&L interest and the cash taxes and P&L taxes. And the question would be is, at what point do those 2 things narrow, do you start booking cash at the P&L rates for taxes and interest? So what's going on there?", "John K. Martin", "It's really timing, Michael. I wouldn't look too much -- that much into it. One of the reasons why we think cash taxes are going to up in 2012 as compared to 2011 is because of the timing of when the payments occur. So it benefited us a little bit in '11. We'll have to deal with higher levels in '12, but we're also going to grow the underlying free cash flow from operations in '12. So -- but it's one of the reasons why, as we talk about 2012 free cash flow, we're anticipating our conversion rate of operating income and EBITDA to be roughly constant as compared to '11. And some of you may remember that we had been projecting that free cash flow conversion levels would accelerate in '12 versus '11. I would just remind you that our free cash flow actually came in higher in '11 than we were anticipating. So as a result of that, flat conversion is still at very strong levels, but it's basically growth in operating income being somewhat offset by growth in interest because of higher net debt levels and growth in taxes.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I know you're in the early stages of monetizing your NCAA affiliate deals. Can you give us an update on how the conversations are going? And do you think these conversations imply that you could see an acceleration in affiliate fee growth beginning in 2013?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, we're really confident in what is going to happen on affiliate side because of that deal. We've already signed some deals, and we're getting more than the -- well, we're getting the value we sought. I'm also -- we're also having pretty constructive conversations with other affiliates beyond the ones we've already done. Basically, we are above the levels that we want and aim to be at in order to go and make this programming investment. So we're even more confident now than when we signed that this is going to be very profitable for us. I'm not -- we're not going to get into the exact timing of when the effects of this hit affiliate rates. It won't be as much in '12 and '13 as it will be in later years, and it's going to be very significant.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And you mentioned some softness in the volume and the overall advertising market in the first quarter, even though scatters are obviously up nicely over the upfront levels. Have -- those verticals that have sort of pulled back are staying out a little bit. Are you seeing any abnormal activity in terms of cancellation of commitments for the June quarter maybe from those verticals or just in general?", "John K. Martin", "Alexia, it's John. The answer is no, in terms of abnormality. We're seeing cancellation levels in Q2 at or about the same level as we've seen in each of the last 3 years. And in terms of verticals, I think, as I mentioned in, I think, an answer to an earlier question, we have seen some pullback from global packaged goods companies. We've also seen a little bit of softness in some other categories that you wouldn't ordinarily think of, and we think it may be more due to timing than anything else. But there has been some softness in media spending and some softness in movie studio spending, but that could be more product specific as opposed to anything secular or cyclical there rather. So we're not setting off the alarm bells here in any way. I don't want to misguide you in terms of -- but it's just early days, and we're in the middle of February. And so we just feel like being cautiously optimistic at this point is a prudent way to approach the year.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So for Jeff, you mentioned expansion in key international territories as a core goal this year. So I was just hoping if you'd provide more specifics around which territories would be considered key territories and what expansion could entail. I mean -- well, I guess, where we're trying to go here is trying to understand the potential size of acquisitions looking forward and whether the $1-billion guidance for international 2014 EBIT includes -- is organic from here or includes likely acquisitions.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We think we can hit those goals with organic growth of what we've already got. Just to give you a little more flavor, we grew revenues double digits around 14% in 2011. And that's despite the exposure to more mature businesses, such as home entertainment and Publishing. And we're seeing even better growth than that at the Networks. As you know, and John said this, we grew the revenue there more than 25%. The secular trends overseas for Networks are stronger than the U.S. We're seeing particularly strong growth in Latin America. We did well over $1 billion across the company there this year. And as we go to the cable network side, we think it's going to be a very key, steady and reasonably fast-growing part of the business. I think we just -- we said it already on the call, the $650 million of adjusted OI [ph] that you just referred to. And we think that, that's going to hit $1 billion in the next few years just on organic growth. The areas where we've been focused, to answer, I think you asked it geographically, are Latin America, Eastern Europe. We put some effort into India. It hasn't worked very well so far. But we continue to look at that pretty hard. And that's where we're going, and we're going to build on our positions. Our margins, just to go to that part, are reasonably strong in Latin America. They're not as high as the U.S. domestic levels. But it shows you, as you go through the world in our Network business, that you can have strong margins heading towards U.S. levels as the markets in which we're operating develop, so Latin America first, Eastern Europe next and then South Asia after that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was enjoying the narrative from Jeff on more strategically on content and distribution. I'm just wondering where Apple fits in. I think, I mean, it's hard to deny Apple has just become a tremendous force in terms of media consumption. Is Apple good for Time Warner and the content companies? Where do you see them fitting in terms of distribution of your content?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, Apple's great for Time Warner. It's great for films. It's great for networks. It's great for magazines. Remember, all are -- basically what happens when you have great interface devices like Apple, and you could say the same thing for Facebook, is that you have better opportunities for consumers to read or watch our TV, our movies and our magazines. And what you've seen -- and there's, I think, been confusion out there over the last couple of years, is when you look at strong brands, hit titles, movies, TV shows, magazines like People, all the viewing when you give people choice goes to the hit titles, the newest things. And what we're doing, which we've said it over and over -- I'm sorry, I'll have to say it again. We're making our hit shows, movies and magazines available to our engaged readers and viewers exactly how they want it, for no extra cost, in a way that's really even more engaging than how they used to get what they read or what they watched. So what you have, not just Apple, but all these technological advances just makes the programming and the magazines more valuable. And we think we have a model that appeals greatly to consumers. It's really a proven model. There's no reason it can't succeed wildly, and I think you're really seeing that happen now.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And does that stay true as Apple -- there's been talk that Apple television and Apple television will be introduced. So if the consumer increasingly actually uses Apple as the primary interface for content consumption, does that change, that create risk to the affiliate model? Or do you hold by your comments here? I'm just trying to figure that out in my mind.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "An Apple screen is a television. So if you like your Sony TV at home or your Samsung TV on the wall or your Apple iPad sitting in your lap, they're all televisions, and our shows are all on them. And you can get them all whenever you want for no extra charge.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi.", "Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I just had 2 quick ones. I think there was a difference between net income and adjusted net income of about $173 million in the quarter reflecting the write-down of CETV, which I assume is just a mark-to-market gain. Has anything changed in terms of your view of the strategic value of the assets, sort of holding aside the vagaries of the market? And then my second question is, and I may be reading something into this that's meaningless, but your definition of adjusted EPS seem to include some incremental items related to pension plan curtailments. Is that meaningful at all?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "So the good news is I can give the pension plan accounting. That's just an accounting. It hasn't changed in our view. We're very optimistic about CME in that market. And it's essentially just the stock market there for all companies there. And we have the mark-to-market on that.", "Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "But you still like the asset?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes.", "John K. Martin", "And, Jason, it's John. Regarding the change in the definition, there's really nothing there other than periodically, we go and review the definition and try to figure out whether there are other potential things that could happen that really aren't indicative of our ordinary course of business or our normal business actions. So -- but it's not significant at all. In fact, if you look back, there's nothing really in history that would have captured or fallen into this definition. So if you -- so it doesn't change the base of EPS with which we're going to compare our future performance against for 2011. So that's the first point I'd make. And the second point I'd make, and I just want to be clear on this, we're not considering doing anything at this point either. So I don't want to foreshadow something that we're going to do and we're trying to get ahead of it by changing the definition. That's not the case at all. It's just that periodically, we evaluate the benefit plans that we have, and we could make adjustments if we determine that they're in the best interest of the company. So that's all. It's immaterial. There's virtually nothing going backwards.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks a lot. And Christine, I think with that, we're just about on the hour.

My name is Hilda, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Shapiro, you may begin.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Douglas Shapiro", "Our 2012 business outlook. Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site.", "And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Thanks. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results put us in a great position to achieve our financial goals for the year. We grew revenue 4%. We grew adjusted operating income 6%, and we grew adjusted EPS by 16%. And while these results were very good, they understate the strength of the fundamentals underlying our businesses.", "Let me give you a sense of what I mean, starting with Turner where we're seeing great momentum at many of our networks. This quarter, TBS was up over 30% in prime time in adults 18 to 49, making it the #1 network on all cable for the first time in a decade.", "The Big Bang Theory is performing fantastically. It was the #1 sitcom on cable this quarter, and it more than doubled the delivery in its timeslot. And it's helping to lift ratings across the schedule.", "Conan, for instance, has grown viewership for each of the past 6 months and now outdelivers every other late-night talk show in adults 18 to 34. These ratings also provide a great platform from which to launch new originals. TBS will debut several scripted comedies this year: Men at Work later this month, Sullivan & Son in July and the Wedding Band in December. And we'll add unscripted originals starting early next year. Or consider truTV that just delivered its most-watched quarter ever for men 18 to 34, and it was a top 10 entertainment network in delivery of men 18 to 49.", "Cartoon Network is also showing great momentum, driven by the popularity of shows like Adventure Time and Regular Show. And lately, it's one of the only kids' networks that's growing. During the quarter in which both of our major competitors declined, Cartoon's viewership among kids 6 to 11 grew 14%. And Cartoon's sister network, Adult Swim, is also posting great numbers. It, too, just completed its most-watched first quarter ever and, again, ranked #1 among all cable for delivery of young adults demos.", "The one exception among our entertainment networks was TNT where, as we anticipated, ratings remained challenged in the quarter. Nevertheless, we're confident we'll see improvements starting next month. And by the back half of this year, we expect ratings to be up over last year.", "In June, we'll have the first refresh of our prime time acquired programming on TNT in several years as we begin to strip The Mentalist. We'll also debut 4 new originals shows this summer: Dallas, The Great Escape, Perception and Major Crimes. And we'll bring back some of our highest-rated originals including Rizzoli & Isles and Falling Skies, plus the final episode of The Closer.", "At the same time, we're continuing to see fantastic performance from our sports programming at TNT, TBS and tru. The NBA on TNT was up for the fifth straight year, making it the highest rated in the network's 28-year history with the league. It's now abundantly clear that the delayed season did not dampen fans' enthusiasm at all.", "We're also extremely pleased with the NCAA men's basketball tournament, which has exceeded in every way the expectations we had when we signed the contract 2 years ago. In addition to strong ratings, we continue to see great demand from advertisers and very strong performance from our digital properties.", "On our news networks, CNN faced extremely hard comparisons against the events in Japan and the Middle East in the first quarter last year. But that's the nature of the news cycle. Propelled by its brand and global newsgathering capabilities, CNN is still the place where more viewers turn when there's hard news. That was evidenced this quarter when CNN was #1 among 18 to 34s on primary nights. And HLN was the only cable news network to see growth in prime time compared with the first quarter of 2011. It was up 7% over last year.", "So overall, we feel really good about the momentum we're seeing across Turner's Networks. That underscores the value that we provide to viewers, advertisers and our affiliates. It puts us in a great position as we head into the upfront, and it gives us great confidence as we enter our next cycle of affiliate negotiations at Turner.", "Over the next few years, we'll negotiate tariff renewals for all of our networks, with almost all of our affiliates. We have a number of renewals set for next year, and we will just about finish the process by the end of 2016. We believe strongly that many of our brands are substantially undervalued today. In this next round of affiliate negotiations, we will be very aggressive and correct that. So as we look out to 2014 and beyond, we expect Turner's domestic affiliate fees to grow at a considerably higher rate than they have during the past several years.", "I'll turn now to HBO where we're also seeing incredible momentum with our content. In recent quarters, I've said that HBO's programming is arguably better today than it's ever been. I'd like to retract that statement. Now, there's no argument. We just debuted the second season of Game of Thrones to fantastic ratings. This year, the series is averaging over 11 million viewers. That's compared to a little over 9 million on average for the first season. And that makes it the third most popular show ever on HBO, behind only The Sopranos and True Blood.", "We're also very excited by a trio of new shows on HBO. Girls from Lena Dunham and VEEP with Julia Louis-Dreyfus are generating tremendous spots. And in June, we'll debut The Newsroom from Aaron Sorkin.", "During the quarter, we accelerated the rollout of HBO GO. HBO GO is now available to virtually all of the domestic HBO sub base. We also launched on Microsoft's Xbox and on Samsung connected TVs, and we'll be announcing additional platform launches in the next few months.", "Until now, the vast majority of users have accessed GO online or on tablets or mobile devices. We expect to see even higher usage as it becomes widely accessible on connected TVs. And while it's still early days, we're seeing encouraging signs that HBO GO will have a significant positive impact on our business over time.", "Consumers using GO are watching HBO more than the they used to, and 93% say GO makes them more loyal to HBO. A second part to the consumer excitement around GO, we're also seeing a bigger marketing push from many of our affiliates. And in fact, HBO is now better positioned and promoted than it has been in years.", "Now I'll shift to Warner Bros., which is also on a roll. As we've discussed with you before, our TV Production business had a great 2011-2012 season. In addition to strong performances from some of our previous returning shows like The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, The Voice, Mike & Molly and The Mentalist, we also produced the #1 new comedy of the season, 2 Broke Girls, and the #2 new drama, Person of Interest. So we'll have an extremely strong slate of returning shows heading into the fall.", "And while it's a little early to make predictions, we are in as strong a position as ever heading into this year's pilot season. We also saw solid performances from our film slate this quarter. Journey 2: The Mysterious Island and Project X handily exceeded our expectations. Notably, both Journey 2 and Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows surpassed their predecessors at the global box office, which is yet more evidence of Warner's skill at managing film franchises. And while Wrath of the Titans didn't perform as well as we'd hope domestically, it's doing very well internationally.", "Looking out over the course of the rest of the year, we're really excited about our slate and several big releases in particular. Next week, we'll premiere Dark Shadows with Johnny Depp from Tim Burton. And of course, later in the year, we'll release 2 of the most hotly anticipated films of 2012: The Dark Knight Rises and the first installment of The Hobbit.", "So summing up, it's early in the year, but we're off to a great start. The underlying fundamentals of nearly all our businesses are getting stronger. That makes us even more confident that we'll achieve our financial goals in 2012 and continue to post attractive growth in the coming years.", "With that, I'll hand it off to John.", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. During my remarks, I'll refer to a presentation that is now available on our website. The first slide shows the highlights from the quarter.", "Coming into this year, we set a goal to deliver double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth again. With 16% growth in the first quarter, we're obviously off to a great start. And as Jeff highlighted, we're seeing momentum across almost all of our businesses, which makes us even more confident that we'll be able to maintain attractive levels of growth this year and into the foreseeable future.", "During the first quarter, revenues were up 4%, which was a result of growth across all major sources of revenues. Adjusted operating income grew 6% and margins moved up modestly despite a $35 million impairment associated with the cancellation of the HBO series, Luck. We were able to do that due to continued cost controls across our businesses, including holding SG&A costs flat year-over-year.", "Moving down the P&L, adjusted earnings per share rose 16%. Please note that our tax provision this quarter included a nearly $30 million reserve related to a potential resolution of a tax dispute. So the effective tax rate was higher this quarter than it has been previously. Going forward, we continue to expect that our effective tax rate should remain somewhere around 35%.", "Growth in adjusted EPS was helped by our ongoing share repurchase program, which underscores our continued commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased about $730 million of our shares, and we paid over $250 million in dividends.", "So with all that said, we're very much on track to meet our financial goals for the year. And this morning, we reaffirmed our full year outlook for low double-digit growth in adjusted EPS in 2012.", "So let me move on to a discussion of our business segments, and let me begin at Networks where overall growth rates were somewhat modest in the first quarter. But underneath that, Turner was up double-digits year-over-year in adjusted operating income, and margins were up 200 basis points. And that was partially offset by a year-over-year decline at HBO, which had difficult comparisons to the second-cycle domestic cable syndication of Sex and the City last year, as well as the impairment that I just mentioned.", "Subscription revenues at the Networks segment grew in the mid-single digits, which was driven by higher domestic rates at both Turner and HBO. Turning to advertising. Revenues were up 6% year-over-year, and that's a little bit better than we expected when we were coming into the quarter.", "There were some items affecting growth in both directions in the quarter. But if you look through those core domestic growth rates, we're pretty close to the 6% that we reported. For instance, as we've discussed with you before, due to the NBA lockout, we haven't been able to monetize the NBA games at the same level this year as we did last year. So that hurt growth somewhat in the quarter, but that was offset by the timing of a couple of NCAA tournament games, as well as the timing of when Easter hit this year.", "Moving over to international. International revenues grew mid-single digits, and that would have been up double digits if it weren't for the year-over-year negative impact related to Imagine, which is our general entertainment network in India, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates.", "As you may have seen, this quarter, we've decided to shut down Imagine. We're having great success in many international territories and, including our HBO joint ventures, we still expect our international networks business to generate $1 billion in adjusted operating income by 2014.  We're also launching new networks where we see opportunities like HBO Netherlands. But Imagine was not succeeding, so we decided to redirect resources elsewhere. Keep in mind that although we were losing a lot of money at Imagine, it generated about $30 million in advertising revenue over the trailing 4 quarters. So shutting it down will actually improve profitability, but it will be a drag of 50 to 100 basis points per quarter on ad revenue growth for the next year.", "Looking to the second quarter, the domestic scatter environment looks pretty steady. We're seeing double-digit price increases over the upfront and very strong demand for our sports properties. And while it's still early, solid pricing and low cancellations are positive indicators for this year's upfront.", "Setting aside a number of items, advertising growth in Q2 should be as high or higher than the 6% pace we reported in the first quarter. But reported ad growth will likely be somewhat lower. The timing of NCAA games and Easter this year and the shutdown of Imagine will both be a drag in the second quarter.", "In addition, in line with our announcement last November, this quarter management of our digital sports properties, including SI.com and Golf.com shifted back over to Time Inc. And that will be a drag on Networks ad growth of about 100 basis points in each of the next 4 quarters in our Networks division. But, of course, that revenue will be recognized at Publishing, so there's no impact to the overall company.", "Notwithstanding any quarterly fluctuations in reported ad growth, we feel good about the trajectory of our networks, and we're optimistic that this year's upfront, improved ratings at TNT and the U.S. presidential election will help our performance in the back half of the year.", "Adjusted operating income was up 3% in the quarter, which included the impairment for Luck. Excluding that, programming expenses would have been up less than 4% in the quarter and margins would have climbed over last year. And I'll point out that despite the impairment, we still expect to grow adjusted operating income at the Networks segment at a faster rate in 2012 than we did in 2011.", "Turning now to film and TV. Warner Bros. has had another great start to a year, with adjusted operating income up almost 40% year-over-year. The increase in adjusted operating income was largely due to growing demand for our television product as evidenced by mid-teens TV growth. That came from both higher television license fees and increased SVOD revenues. And as Jeff described, we're in a great position to drive continued growth from our TV business going forward.", "Theatrically, we saw very strong performances from both Journey 2: The Mysterious Island and Project X, and we benefited from the carryover from the fourth quarter release of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Notably, both Sherlock and Journey 2 outperformed the first film in their respective franchises.", "So as we look to the rest of the year despite difficult year-over-year comparisons in terms of financial performance, we remain very, very confident that 2012 will be one of the highest years in terms of profitability in Warner Bros.' history.", "On to Publishing where both the first quarter revenues and adjusted operating income were down year-over-year. Advertising revenues declined 5% due to softness in domestic magazine advertising. Subscription revenues were down slightly as we continue to see softness in domestic and international newsstand. So with lower revenue, adjusted operating income was down $24 million year-over-year in the quarter.", "Looking ahead, we have not seen any material change in the underlying trends for either subscriptions or ad revenue. However, the comparisons are particularly difficult in the second quarter. Recall that last year's second quarter was the only quarter during the year where revenues grew year-over-year.", "So given the current revenue environment, we'll obviously be placing continued focus on cost controls here for the remainder of the year. And because of this, as well as easier revenue comparisons in the second half, we expect adjusted operating income growth trends to improve as the year progresses, especially in the back half of the year.", "Moving on, the next slide shows our 2012 financial outlook. As I noted earlier, we're off to a great start, and we're on track to deliver another year of double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. As we do from time to time, I wanted to offer some perspective as to how the growth will likely come in over the rest of the year.", "In terms of progression, our results should be weighted towards the back half of the year and, in particular, the fourth quarter. The second quarter could be somewhat challenged from a year-over-year growth standpoint, and that's a function of a significant intersegment elimination from the Warner Bros. sale of The Mentalist to Turner, as well as continuing challenges at Publishing. Likewise, our film and TV comparisons will be difficult in the third quarter due to last year's syndication sale of Big Bang Theory and the theatrical release of the last Harry Potter film. So both film and TV profitability, as well as overall company growth, will be heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter. This progression is pretty much what we expected as we entered the year. So we feel pretty good about how things are continuing to shape up.", "Turning to the next slide, which looks at free cash flow. We generated nearly $320 million of free cash in the quarter. That's down from a year ago, principally due to higher use of working capital. And that was due primarily just to timing related to programming payments at the Networks, as well as higher cash taxes.", "As we noted during last earnings, in 2012, we expect to convert about a similar amount of our adjusted OIBDA into free cash. We expect to convert a similar amount this year as we did a year ago.", "And on the final slide, which looks at our net debt, we ended the first quarter with $16.6 billion in net debt. That's up about $600 million compared to just the end of last year, and that's due almost entirely to our continued returns to shareholders. We returned almost $1 billion during the quarter, including, as I mentioned earlier, around $730 million in share repurchases.", "We've maintained our leverage ratio at around 2.4x, and that's close to our target of 2.5x. So no changes there. And we still believe that 2.5x strikes the right balance of maintaining balance sheet strength while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses, make acquisitions and return capital to shareholders.", "So thank you for listening. And now let me turn the call back over to Doug where we're going to start the Q&A portion. Thanks.", "Douglas Shapiro", "All right. Thanks, John. Hilda, let's get the Q&A started. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Two questions if I could. First, Jeff, you mentioned you're optimistic about the upfront. I was wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about where you think pricing could possibly go and also sellout this year versus last. And then the second question. You guys are about 6 months into the rollout of UltraViolet. So, Jeff, I was wondering if you could just share with us your assessment of the rollout so far? And would you contemplate any changes in the home video business with respect to Windows or pricing of EST.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "All right, Spencer. On the upfront, basically, it's looking pretty good. Cancellations are low, and scatter pricing is solidly above the upfront. Historically, those are good signs. And if you just think through our Networks, we've got very good momentum. TBS is the #1 cable network in prime time. TNT is about to launch a significant refresh of its programming. truTV and Adult Swim continue to grow with tough-to-reach demos. It really -- both of them are places where it's hard to reach the audience that watch them -- watches them. CNN is going to benefit from the election. And remember, CNN has the widest reach. More people tune in to CNN than any other news network. And Cartoon Network is taking significant viewing share from its competition, probably because a lot of competing cartoon and kids networks have their shows elsewhere, not just on their networks. They're on SVOD services. So I think we're really well positioned. And whatever happens in the upfront generally, we're going to get our fair share or more than that. So we feel very good about that. On UltraViolet, basically, we're happy with the launch. We think it's a big accomplishment for the industry, and it was something that we had tried to do and see if a lot of others would join up. And we think UltraViolet offers a compelling ease-of-use way to access your movies from the cloud and on whatever device you want to use. It's still early, but consumers are downloading and streaming in very large numbers. Just a couple of data points. More than 2 million accounts have been created, and over 5,000 titles are available. It took 5 months for the first million registrations and then we added 1 million more in the last 4 weeks. So at this point, other studios are releasing in UV, not just Warner. Universal, Sony and Paramount have done that. Both Wal-Mart and Amazon are now supporting UltraViolet, and we think other retailers will follow. And we think it's going to be more compelling as more companies and consumers participate. The question that I think you ended up with is, is it at the right price? We think the first step is to continue to make electronic sell-through product easy to use, easy to get, easy to understand, not intimidating for people to buy. We don't set the prices, but we're going to work with our retail partners who have every interest in making this successful and setting the right price that really satisfies consumers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I have one for Jeff. And then, John, just a housekeeping. So for Jeff, over the past couple of years, you've been very, very adamant in saying that when the syndicated shows go into an online streaming model, they have -- the sprockets run off of them, which hurts the long-term shelf value. So I wonder now that we had some time, and maybe some other people have different models out there about selling stuff into SVOD, I wonder if your thinking has changed about that, to what shows can be sold in and what happens to the value in SVOD.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes. As a starting point, we want to reiterate that we think, and we have all along, that there's clearly a role for SVOD in the ecosystem. And we are more than happy to work with SVOD companies to license our content. That's what we've been doing. But to your more precise question, which content should we license, what content is going to be optimized through SVOD licensing, our overarching goal, as we've always said, is simply to maximize the lifetime value of the content. And so let's go through what kind of things belong where. For the shows that are likely to have multiple cycles, one consideration is the potential impact of SVOD on the value of subsequent cycles. So, of course, if you've got something up on SVOD that runs the sprockets off, you're going to erode the value for those kinds of shows that have second and third cycle syndication. And as we all know, some of those big shows have huge second and third cycle values. So let's take an example like Big Bang Theory, which on -- look, we're not saying categorically, but it's unlikely if you look at the prospects for Big Bang Theory that it's going to go to an SVOD service at least anytime soon for a number of reasons. It obviously is commanding very high license fees from traditional networks and stations who want exclusive rights for those exhibitions. There is a very large barter component to that, which, of course, doesn't exist on SVOD as a source of monetization. And so in that case, trying to balance the value of later cycles. For older content that has either already gone through several cycles or for shows that are serialized -- they, therefore, don't have multiple cycles and they work better for viewers on a VOD basis -- serialized dramas would be a pretty good example. That's really not a concern, and those are the kind of things that you can be more efficient with when you put them on SVOD. We had -- for example, let's take The CW deal that we did, which was an SVOD sale to Netflix. And those shows had more efficient and higher value in an SVOD service, with a little earlier availability than we thought we could get in traditional syndicated buyers. So it really depends on the nature of the programming. And what's emerging, as we always thought it would, is basically an efficient market where the addition of SVOD makes content more valuable and where, last point, to quote traditional networks that used to buy syndicated products and you thought that all that was, was going to be available on a once-a-week or twice-a-week schedule, remember, all the traditional syndicated buyers, particularly cable networks, are now putting that product, think of the Big Bang Theory, on VOD given TV Everywhere. So you can watch it on TBS, multiple episodes.", "John K. Martin", "And, Michael, I'm sorry. He didn't ask the question or he did? Did you -- you said you had a question on...", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "No, I was going to say, John, could you just tell us how much Imagine lost last year? Have you seen seasonality to the losses?", "John K. Martin", "The losses last year for Imagine were around $70 million. We lost around $10 million in Q1. I don't remember the exact seasonality as we progressed through the year, but I think the losses grew bigger in the back half. But I don't remember exactly quarter-by-quarter. But in total, $70 million.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Jeff, I wanted to ask you 2 questions. One, just back to your prior comment on the kids market. And there's a lot of debate out there about the role of kids programming online versus in a linear format. And I'm curious if you think the decision by Nick, Nickelodeon to put content online has, at all, hurt cartoon or the overall ecosystem by just drawing  eyeballs away. And then on HBO, sort of an unrelated question, I've always heard that as you move towards more on-demand consumption, whether it's GO or SVOD on HBO, that the viewing shifts more to originals and away from film content. And I'm wondering if that's still true. And if it is, would you consider shifting more of your investment capital away from output deals to originals, which actually could, in theory, drive some margins at HBO?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes. First question, do we think that having -- and you asked it in the case of kids. If you look at viewing in cable, cable actually continued to take share from broadcast. That's particularly true if you look in prime time. It was less clear in total day, and we think that the kind of last trend in cable viewing in total day was in kids viewing, when kids viewing went to SVOD rather than to watching the cable networks. Now Cartoon Network was up 14%. So we didn't have that problem, and we think part of the reason is that we don't have our program sitting on an SVOD service where parents can park their kids in front of an SVOD. And obviously, that's taking some viewing away from some of the other animated channels, which -- not ours, but theirs probably for that reason. We think the same thing if you don't ask in an animated and you look at regular TV programming. The more that it shows up on demand, on TNT and USA and CBS, and the less that it shows up on on-demand services with 100 episodes sitting there with a low commercial load, the more you're going to see the same thing. And that's why we -- our ratings for our shows and our kind of sales and rentals for TV shows that we then put out into the aftermarket do better so long as they're not overexposed someplace else. If you go to HBO, to your question, yes. When people use on-demand, they do use it for movies at HBO. And HBO has a really strong movie lineup that -- it's superior to any other pay TV network. But HBO also has an even greater advantage in terms of the depth and quality of its original series versus other pay TV. And so what happens in on-demand is people go and catch up and watch those series. So there is more original programming viewing in on-demand then there would be slightly. And it'll probably increase because HBO is in the process right now, as we said, of dramatically increasing the number of original series on HBO. What that leads to, to your question, should we -- would we want to drop a studio? We've said very clearly that the advantage HBO has, given the fairly large throw weight advantage we've got in movie deals and the large advantage in original series, that we have the luxury of choice of whether we want to drop a studio. And we're essentially going to evaluate that. First and foremost, for the power of our networks domestically and worldwide, because our originals fuel the worldwide business in HBO, not just the 40 million subs in America but 60 million-plus worldwide that are growing rapidly, that obviously lends to originals. And then the second consideration will just be economics. Is it worth it to us to spend whatever we decide to spend on theatrical films?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I have one for Jeff and one for John. First, Jeff, for films that have exited the post -- have exited the pay TV window. So they're being marketed on your online distributors like iTunes, like Amazon. I'm wondering if you see an acceleration at all of volume of electronic rentals given, really, in terms of rental market, you have so many more points of purchase in a digital world than you did in the old Blockbuster days. And then secondly, for John, it might be helpful, just given conversation around your affiliate fee renewals, to get some color on the cadence of those renewals? One of the -- when are the bulk of your Turner deals coming up for renewal? And maybe, could you even just talk a little bit about the drivers of your potential rights fee increases?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, that -- okay, I didn't understand the first -- You're asking what about electronic? Rental or...", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, I'm just asking about really the split between -- within electronic sell-through, the split between ownership and rental. It seems like in a mobile tablet world, the consumer with all this content having the ability to be stored in the cloud might choose to rent as opposed to own more so. And I understand the economics aren't as good as the sell-through market, but maybe you make it up on volume because you've got so many hundreds of millions of mobile devices out there. And maybe that's what happens because of all the incremental touch points as opposed to a finite number of rental video stores back in the old days.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay, now I understand. Yes. Well, passing VOD, the statement we made which is true, that electronic sell-through was quite robust this quarter, and going to your point, why would consumers want to buy something if rental and availability of films gets more easy, so they don't need to own it.  It's a good question. It's going to have some -- it will depend on how easy it is to, when you own something, a film, to management -- to manage it, get access to it and think that it's important for you to have it that way. It'll depend on the price, as I think your question implies. And basically, then you get to the habit that people have had where they have, whether it's in books, music, TV shows or films, there is a tendency for people to collect and to want to own and have available. And as you -- whatever the movie is. Even if you say to yourself, as your question implies, \"Well, why do I need to own it? I can get it anytime.\" Although there is a kind of an emotional reaction that if I'm going to have to rent it every time and cost me, I'd rather own it. So you get back to that really trade off in people's minds, the ease of having it on the shelf. Now, on the shelf means in the cloud, the ease of being able to give it to your kids 8x. It kind of depends on the genre. There are plenty of genres you can imagine. Animated for young kids is one, comedies for -- 10s, 20s and 30s is another one where people watch them over and over. And so they don't want to rent them, they want to own them. And then there's some kind of things they love that could be dramas or big epics where they really want to own that and have it in their home. So I think it's going to evolve. If you look for data points, to your question, and look at iTunes, which is obviously electronic sale and rental, 60% of the money is still purchase versus rental. Similar to what we had in physical. But we're not saying to you that we know the -- I think your question is an intelligent one. I don't mean to say that patronizingly. We all have the same question, where is this going to go? If we make the ownership realities for our average consumer easy and rewarding, and if rental continues to get better and easy to use, right now rental is easy to use than ownership, we'll just have to see it unfold. And I think pricing -- to the extent that there's pressure on ownership, if pricing moves to motivate ownership, then I think your question's exactly right, where the volume makes up for whatever price adjustment needs to occur.", "John K. Martin", "It's John. Let me to provide a little bit more context for -- I think you used the word cadence as it relates to our affiliate renewal cycle. But obviously, I'm going to have to fall short of providing a tremendous amount of transparency because we have confidentiality provisions around most, if not all, of our agreements. If you look at -- we've already been in the market, and we've done some deals as it relates to those networks that are covering March Madness. And what we have seen, by virtue of having done those deals, is it's only underscored and increased our confidence in our ability to get the type of rate increases that we think bring TBS, TNT and truTV up closer to fair value. And we have every intention to try to drive rate aggressively to get fair value over time. The majority of those rate renewals will come into effect -- well, they'll all be in effect before the end of 2016, but they'll be on the first material step-up beginning in 2014. If you look at Turner in total this year, there aren't any major contract renewals. Next year, there are certain contract renewals for Networks, including CNN and Cartoon Network. And we feel confident in our ability to drive rate there as well. So I think we are very, very confident in the long term affiliate fee outlook that we've got the pricing increases that we've been able to garner. And recent deals have only underscored our confidence, and they've all been at much higher rates than we've gotten in the most recent rate renewal cycles, if that makes sense. In other words, the increases -- yes, the rate increases that we're getting now are higher than the rate increases that we got before. And we have every intention to try to get our networks closer to where we believe fair value is going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "Your sub fee growth in the quarter was 5%. You've answered a couple of questions talking about the growth that's going to come from renewals. But also wondering, historically, one of the biggest drivers for all of the cable network industry has been new distributors. And wondering how you think about the evolution of new distributors over the next few years. There's the prospect we're hearing more and more of people talking about non-facilities-based distributors, these so-called virtual MVPDs. If people come to you and want to license all of your channels and pay you at the top end of your rate card, how do you feel about that risks, rewards.  How do you think about what that could do above and beyond the accelerations you're going to get from the core renewals you talked earlier about?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, there are many aspiring entities that do come forth and we want to offer that. And we do talk with them in detail and as constructive a way as we can. We're willing to look at anything that makes sense provided that it, in fact, does provide long-term sustainable distribution. And one of the major issues when you evaluate that is number one, are the economics additive? I think you said it well when you said, look, those people, in order to win programming rights from established well-distributed networks, are going to try to offer wholesale money that is at the top end of what goes on right now in the industry. But the question for whether they're going to be able to pay that is whether offering consumers anything that's really valuable to consumers and whether they're going to be able to deliver quality transmission of network programming. Think of it high-def, think of it on-demand and what that takes, and how they're going to do that over the distribution plan. So we're all looking at that as are the existing distributors. Whether it's cable operators, the telcos, DirecTV and DISH, all trying to figure out how to continue to move forward, offering consumers the kinds of packages that they want, whether it's over the traditional video broadcasting that they've used or over Internet protocol. So it's an open subject. Right now, we don't see -- we haven't seen any particularly viable \"virtual MSOs\" that would appear to us to have a sustainable ability to deliver a benefit to consumers. But if we see one of those, then we would be open to figuring out whether that would work on a long-term basis.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "And then could I just follow up on Hulu? How do you think a Hulu-authenticated model could work for you?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, we think Hulu authenticating makes sense. We think the authenticating of -- the authentication of the programming inside Hulu, which is basically nbc.com, fox.com, abc.com make sense also, obviously because they're trying to strengthen their economic base by adding a carriage fee. And so if that's -- it's perfectly consistent with having a carriage fee to have the programming available on demand but in an authenticated way, whether it's on nbc.com or fox.com or whether it's on Hulu, which is the aggregation of those. We think Hulu's heading in the right direction now, and it might be useful -- continue to be viable.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna Financial Group.", "Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "One quick one for John. John, what would advertising revenue growth in the quarter be if TNT ratings didn't decline? And then one for Jeff. Jeff, you spoke pretty often about how there is a gap between general entertainment, cable networks, CPM and broadcast networks. And I was wondering if you could tell us if you see that gap contracting over the past couple of years and if there is still an opportunity for further contraction? And would it be easier for you now to drive pricing, now that TBS rating has stabilized and hopefully, TNT will stabilize soon?", "John K. Martin", "Actually -- it's John. Let me try to address your question, although I'm not exactly sure how to answer it. Clearly, if TNT's ratings were higher, our ad revenues would be higher. We'd be delivering greater gross rating points, and we'd be monetizing our inventory at higher levels. I'm not going to try to characterize to you exactly the materiality of that because I think, in some respects, and we've talked about this before, over any near term and even medium term, the correlation between ratings and ad revenues isn't always perfectly correlated. So there's lots and lots of things that go into the determination of ad revenues, and it has to do with yield managements, sponsorships, mix of inventory, type of demographics that the networks are delivering. But overall, it's clearly a drag on ad revenues, and we would anticipate our ad revenue pacings to improve as we progress throughout the year in line or trend-wise with the stabilization and hopefully, improvement with TNT's ratings.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "And I think you asked about what is the difference in price for CPM between cable and broadcast?", "Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Correct.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "On what it was contracting? It has been contracting very gradually over the last 3 or 4 years. We think it's -- we see it continuing. But it still is 20 or more percent, depending on the data point.", "John K. Martin", "I think it also -- just add a little bit there, there are certain elements of programming where the CPMs are essentially at parity now. But there are certain elements of programming, particularly scripted originals in prime where the premium that broadcast garners is materially higher than what cable is getting. So there's a real opportunity to continue to drive that gap narrowing.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Two jump ball questions for Jeff and John. First, should investors consider that timing -- taking back control of its online properties from the Networks group anyway makes it easier to undertake strategic actions with that segment? And then on HBO, with content better than ever, how should we think about the impact on profitability over time from the strong original content lineup? Is that something that directly drives 2012 EBITDA growth? Should we think about a delayed impact because we have to wait for syndication sales maybe in '13? Or are you actually reinvesting the increased value and it's really a longer-term EBITDA impact? That'd be helpful.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "First of all, what we did in the online side of Turner and SI in sports, we had an idea that we could combine the Turner digital sports properties, which potentially exhibit, say, basketball, baseball, et cetera, kinds of things. With the Sports Illustrated site, which draws a lot of viewing to analysis and readership, coverage of every sport, what we found is we just weren't achieving much benefit because the synergy really is between the online and tablet and mobile platforms for SI articles and coverage with the magazine readership. And in the -- and it's not really with, let's say, a baseball game or a basketball game on Turner and exhibition. So we essentially went back to synergizing across the SI platform, print and digital, and the same thing in Turner Sports. None of that would have made or does make any difference in how we -- it's not material enough to change how we think about the operations of either Turner or Publishing in case we wanted to do something and allot one of them with somebody else. I would Just say, on that point, we think Publishing -- and we have a lead position in Publishing. It's a very good business that is core to us. It's got a pretty good return now. It's coming back up. The return on capital, if you exclude purchase price, is now back up into the mid-teens. So it's well ahead of its cost of capital. And while we are right now -- and it's a high cash flow generator. Right now, the whole publishing industry is facing kind of a stall in revenue. So it's not a good situation in the short run. But in the long run, we think there's quite a lot of upside in digital distribution of our publishing position, which is a -- we have a very strong lead position across a lot of areas in publishing. If you go to the HBO question, I think it's -- having a continuing increase in hit original programming and basically maintaining, as I think we do, the whip hand in access to theatrical films in their earliest window after home video puts HBO as a subscription VOD service in the strongest position worldwide. And as we now have a go on GO, in other words, it's available over Internet delivery, it's increasingly available on that basis all over the world, you're going to see obviously, therefore, support in subscription revenue, support and increases in content revenue. Your question asked, or predicted the answer, when you make hit series, think of Game of Thrones right now, True Blood, et cetera, we're going to optimize the value. First, they go across our subscription networks worldwide and then we sell them when we think the time is right as either an electronic sale or a physical DVD sale. And those things are going to be pretty considerable because we have a pretty big backlog of successful series that haven't yet hit the revenue line or the profit line in HBO. So yes, it's coming. It's going to be a steady robust business from now on out.", "John K. Martin", "So just to give a sense because you were asking specific timing as well, if you think about 2012 HBO, go back to what I said in my prepared remarks.  At HBO, our operating income growth is going to accelerate this year compared to last year. And as you look out over the next 9 months, content revenue is going to be up versus the 9 months from a year ago. So to underscore what Jeff said, we're building assets, and we're building assets that -- at a deeper pipeline that we're going to be able to monetize in numerous ways going forward. And the content revenue line is an important line.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Barton Crockett from Lazard Capital Markets.", "Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "I was interested in the discussion in Filmed Entertainment that revenue growth was partly attributable to subscription video on demand availability of television series. I was wondering if you could characterize to some degree the materiality of that? And tell us whether, to some degree, that was related to kind of The CW Netflix deal, and give us some sense of how material that might be for you guys going forward over the balance of the year.", "John K. Martin", "We had recognized in the quarter, we had about $75 million of SVOD money. And based on the deals that we've already got to date, that we've already contracted to date, we would anticipate this year 2012 to recognize somewhere in the area of about $200 million. And we've got constructive discussions ongoing with numerous other parties as more and more entrants seem to be interested in acquiring the types of shows that we have. So we've got a couple of hundred million dollars that we'll recognize to date. But we would assume that, that number's probably going to go up.", "Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "And can you describe to us how we should think about the margin impact of those revenues as they come in?", "John K. Martin", "It's high.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, no cost. Yes.", "John K. Martin", "Well, it depends on the deal. But generally speaking, considerably, considerably higher than the margin that we're -- that is the average margin for the overall segment, which is in low teens.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Miller from Caris & Company.", "David W. Miller - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Jeff, another follow-up question about UltraViolet. I know you mentioned price as an issue, but as I understand it, and just correct me if I'm wrong here, there's just a number of kinks that just need to be ironed out here. I mean, I don't believe you have one set-top box or game console yet supporting the service, and the software -- and please correct me if I'm wrong, that the software which is supposed to power the concept has proven largely ineffective on certain PC models. There's also the iTunes element. What are you guys doing to kind of iron out those kinks? And I know you mentioned that price is still an issue, and I know you answered that first question.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, if you would give me your address, I'll come to your house and I'll wire up all those devices. Sorry to joke about it, but you\u2019re on to a good question, which is -- look, we -- you got -- we're the studios that own the content. We're setting up a template that makes it easier for every kind of device maker, interface maker, software runner and retailer from Wal-Mart to Target, et cetera, to support and line up with getting you exactly and every consumer the kind of on-site unscrambling of the wires that we all know is life in the 21st century. So I think when you have everyone aligned in an offering, then those problems will get solved. And I think those are important problems to solve. It's early in the -- it's early. This is 1.0, I guess we would say. So the content is there. Now the interface companies or functions with real people have to take place. So that's step 2, and that's what's happening this year. And I think that'll pick up speed. Because consumers are going to love this, and they're going to demand that they get solutions to those at-home problems.", "Douglas Shapiro", "All right.

My name is Donna, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that the conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Time Warner. Please proceed.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks, and good morning. This morning we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the second quarter and the other reaffirming our 2012 business outlook. Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website.", "And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Thank you. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Before we begin, on behalf of everyone across Time Warner, I want to express our profound sadness about the terrible events at a screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Colorado 2 weeks ago. Our deepest sympathies go out to the victims of this appalling crime, to their families and their loved ones.", "We're here today to discuss our quarterly earnings, so let me turn to that, and thanks for -- everybody, for listening in.", "Coming into the quarter, we knew we had very difficult comparisons in some of our businesses, and overall, our results came in just about where we expected. John will go through all of that with you in a few minutes, but at the same time, we've seen some very important signs of underlying strength in our businesses over the last few months, particularly at the networks.", "At Turner, for example, we're continuing to show a strong ratings momentum across almost all of our networks. This quarter, TNT was the #1 network on cable, driven by another record-setting NBA season and by our new slate of originals. Our regular season NBA coverage was up for the fifth straight year, making it the most viewed season in our 28-year history with the league. And we had great performance from our original programming. On average, our original series attracted over 40% more viewers this summer than last year. Our new shows perception and Dallas are the #1 and #2 series on cable this year. In fact, including The Closer and Rizzoli & Isles, the top 4 scripted shows currently on ad-supported cable are all on TNT.", "TBS also had a great quarter. It was up 30% in prime time in its key demo. The Big Bang Theory keeps dominating the charts and was again the #1 sitcom on cable. Importantly, it's continuing to lift other shows on the network, and it provides a great platform on which to launch new programming.", "During the last few months, we debuted 2 new shows on TBS, Men at Work and Sullivan & Son, to great success, with Men at Work becoming TBS' most popular original series ever. And rounding out our entertainment networks, truTV was again a top 15 network among men in prime time. It posted its best second quarter ever from men 18 to 49, driven by hits like Hardcore Pawn and Impractical Jokers.", "We also had another strong quarter at our animation networks. Adult Swim remained the #1 network among adults 18 to 49. And like last quarter, Cartoon was the only major kids' network to grow in the quarter, up 12% for kids 6 to 11. Let's just look at the delivery of Cartoon compared to Nickelodeon in that demo. In last year's second quarter, Nickelodeon had almost twice the delivery of Cartoon. This quarter, that gap had shrunk to less than 20%.", "The exception this quarter was CNN. Although CNN's ratings declined in part due to very difficult comparisons with last year, to be clear, we are not satisfied with CNN's ratings performance and we're focused on fixing it. Within the last few weeks, Turner wrapped up a very successful upfront. Once again, we negotiated CPM and volume increases at the top end of the entire television business among both broadcast and cable networks. That's a powerful testament to the appeal of our branded environments, our content and our ability to offer integrated buys  across platforms. So our programming and brands are resonating with viewers and advertisers.", "Our third major constituency, course of, is our affiliates. As we've discussed with you before, between 2013 and 2016, we'll enter negotiations with just about every distributor for just about all our basic cable networks, making it our biggest affiliate renewal cycle in years.", "Turner has some of the most watched and broadest reach networks in cable and some of the strongest brands. And over the last few years, we've made significant investments in our brands and in our programming, and we've granted substantial additional rights to our distributors. So we believe that the value we're delivering to our affiliates exceeds the value we're receiving. We're focused on correcting that in this next cycle. In fact, based in part on the deals we've already struck, we have every confidence that Turner will grow domestic subscription revenue at a double-digit pace annually between 2013 and 2016.", "I'll turn now to HBO, which is also enjoying strong momentum across its businesses. The volume of great shows on HBO right now is without precedent. Game of Thrones has evolved into a bona fide cultural phenomenon, recently finished its second season with over 11 million viewers per episode. And we just debuted the fifth season of True Blood, which keeps going strong as the network's most-watched show. It's on track for more than 12 million viewers per episode this season. And we have a string of new hits, too. The Newsroom is now attracting more than 7 million viewers per episode and viewership is increasing as the season progresses. And both Girls and VEEP have enjoyed solid ratings and great critical acclaim.", "Underscoring the quality of HBO's content, a couple of weeks ago, HBO received 81 prime time Emmy nominations. That's the most of any network for the 12th year in a row, and that included outstanding drama nominations for both Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones, and outstanding comedy nominations for Curb Your Enthusiasm, Girls and VEEP.", "HBO's experiencing some of the most favorable subscriber dynamics it's seen in several years, too. We've already surpassed 100 million subscribers globally this year, faster than we expected. That's been driven primarily by continued rapid growth overseas. But we're also seeing encouraging trends in the U.S., putting us on pace to add more domestic subs this year than we did in 2011.", "We've also been very pleased with the rollout of HBO GO. As you know, HBO GO is now available to our entire U.S. subscriber base. And over the last few months, we've extended support to many new devices such as Xbox, Samsung TVs, the Kindle Fire and Android tablets. Although GO has only been available on TVs for a few months, we're already seeing average monthly usage increase. And as we've mentioned before, over 90% of GO users say they're now more likely to keep their HBO subscription. So as penetration and usage climb, we're confident that GO will benefit subscriber growth and increase the subscriber life cycle.", "I'll move next to Warner Bros. This was another outstanding quarter for Warner Bros. Television production. During the upfront, we secured orders from the broadcast networks for 16 returning series and 9 new shows, making us the top producer of network TV programming yet again, and the only studio with at least one show on each of the broadcast networks. In addition, we successfully brought both 2 Broke Girls and Mike & Molly to the off-network market, bolstering our syndication pipeline in 2014 and 2015.", "During the quarter, we also announced a deal to license Pretty Little Liars and The Lying Game to Netflix. And recently, we struck a deal to syndicate several shows to Amazon Prime, including Fringe and The West Wing.", "In our theatrical business, some of our film releases earlier this quarter fell short of our expectations, such as Rock of Ages and Dark Shadows. However, Magic Mike has substantially outperformed our expectations, and The Dark Knight Rises is on pace to surpass $1 billion at the global box office. Batman is now on track to be the second or third highest-grossing franchise of all time. It's another example of Warner's unparalleled ability to manage broad appeal global film franchises. You'll see more evidence of that ability with the first installment of The Hobbit, which we will release in December. The film is already generating tremendous buzz. And earlier this week, we announced that Peter Jackson, in concert with Warner Bros. and MGM, has decided to make The Hobbit as a trilogy rather than 2 films as originally planned.", "I'll turn next to Time Inc. As John will describe, even though the environment for print magazines is very challenging, Time Inc. has been increasing its share by capitalizing on its scale, its brands and the quality of its editorial. At the same time, we remain focused on continuing to evolve the model for digital magazines. For instance, during the quarter, Time Inc. struck a deal with Apple to enable sales of digital subscriptions on iOS devices. Although it's still early, so far, over half of the subscribers to our digital editions have never subscribed to our titles before, so that's a very encouraging sign.", "Wrapping up, it's been a very productive few months for us. I'm excited about our progress. And with each quarter that passes, I'm even more confident about how we're positioning ourselves.", "With that, I'll hand it off to John.", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. During my remarks, I'll refer to a presentation that is now available on our website, and the first slide shows the highlights.", "The quarter shaped up pretty much as we had expected. Year-over-year growth was held back by very challenging comparisons at Film and TV Entertainment, as well as Publishing, as well as substantial intersegment eliminations. And while the second quarter's financial results were somewhat mixed, we are seeing some healthy underlying trends which I will discuss. And we had a pretty terrific quarter at the Networks group, which posted its highest revenue and adjusted operating income ever for a  second quarter. We were also able to maintain consolidated margins at about 18%. That's a reflection of our continued focus on cost efficiency across the company, so that's good.", "Moving down the P&L, adjusted earnings per share was almost flat year-over-year despite the decline in adjusted operating income, and that's primarily due to the benefit from our ongoing share repurchase program, which is a significant part of our commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders. And during the quarter, we repurchased $565 million of our shares and we paid more than $250 million in dividends. So that means during the first half of the year, we've returned $1.8 billion to shareholders.", "As we look out to the second half of the year, we're in good shape to meet our financial objectives. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year outlook for low-double-digit growth in adjusted EPS.", "Turning to the segment highlights, and I'll begin at the Networks, where healthy revenue and adjusted operating income growth were evidenced at both Turner and HBO, and that's what's drove the record second quarter there. Subscription revenues grew 6% and year-over-year growth accelerated from the past couple of quarters, and that's despite a drag of about 100 basis points from FX.", "Looking at advertising, revenues were up 2% year-over-year. Now there were a number of moving pieces here. And as we've discussed with you in the past, growth was hurt this quarter by the timing of NCAA games and Easter, as well as the shift of management of our digital sports properties, SI.com and Golf.com, back to Time Inc. Looking through these, domestic growth was very similar to the 6% growth that we had in the first quarter and that was despite a decline at our news operations due to lower ratings.", "International advertising revenues were down high-single digits in the quarter, and growth here was hurt by the shutdown of Imagine in India, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange movements.", "Let me look ahead now to advertising revenue growth expectations for the rest of this year, and I want to talk a little bit about Q3 versus Q4. As of now, we're currently not expecting to report positive growth in ad revenues in Q3, but we expect a much, much stronger Q4. And there's a number of different factors, and let me just walk through each of those.", "The first thing is, please keep in mind that the internal shift of our digital sports properties and the 2 international closures at Turner, Imagine, which I just mentioned, and TNT Turkey, will weigh on ad growth overall for the next few quarters. In addition, in the third quarter, scatter demand is a little slow right now and that's due to money being diverted to the Summer Olympics. And the third quarter is also going to be affected by the timing of the Major League Baseball playoffs, as well as our NASCAR lineup. So we expect to have fewer Major League Baseball playoff games in the third quarter and, due to the schedule, there'll be more MLB playoff games in the fourth quarter. That will help Q4 versus Q3. And also, we have the ALCS this year versus the NLCS, which we had last year. And historically, the ALCS has rated higher than the NLCS.", "We also expect growth to be stronger in the fourth quarter as we'll benefit from additional NBA games on TNT, the 2012 presidential election, expectations of improved overall ratings at our other networks in general, some easier comparisons and the expectation of a much stronger scatter market once the Olympics are over.", "Moving over to adjusted operating income, where it was up a pretty strong 9% in the quarter at the Networks group, with margins up around 100 basis points. In addition to revenue growth, the margin expansion reflected continued expense control. Non-programming expenses were essentially flat year-over-year, and programming expenses were up just 3%, and that's despite increased investments in original programming. So overall expenses were up low-single digits in the quarter. And as we look ahead, we anticipate that overall expense growth will remain under tight control. While we'll continue to aggressively increase our investment in original programming, we expect other components of our programming spending to rise more modestly and will continue to work hard to constrain growth in all non-programming expenses.", "Before I move on, let me just take a moment to discuss the recently announced shutdown of TNT's TV operations in Turkey. This was a result of the same investment discipline that we demonstrated last quarter with respect to Imagine in India. But together, they accounted for approximately $160 million in charges on an unadjusted basis this quarter or $0.14 a share net of tax. In each case, when it became clear that we were not on a path to succeed, we moved quickly to shut our operations to enable management to focus even more on our strongest properties. And we've had great success in many international territories, and we continue to expect international networks to be a key driver of our long-term growth.", "Let me turn now to our Film and TV segment. We knew, coming into the second quarter, that year-over-year comparisons here would be extremely challenging. Last year's second quarter benefited from the theatrical release of The Hangover 2 and the home entertainment release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. We also had 2 very successful video game title releases without comparable titles this year. In addition, 2 of this year's releases, Rock of Ages and Dark Shadows, performed well below our expectations.", "Having said that, we had a very strong quarter in our television business. TV revenue was up more than 20% year-over-year to more than $1 billion, and operating income was up double digits. And that's the seventh time in the last 8 quarters where we had double-digit growth in TV. So that continues to be a very, very strong business for us, and this quarter's results were driven by the cable syndication sale of The Mentalist and mid-teens growth in revenue from initial telecasts on broadcast and cable. And as Jeff mentioned, our future syndication pipeline got even stronger with the sales of 2 Broke Girls and Mike & Molly. We're also seeing strong demand from SVOD services and that's evidenced by recent new agreements with Netflix and Amazon Prime. So we've now signed deals that bring in almost $250 million in revenue this year alone, and we remain in active discussions with all major SVOD services about additional content packages.", "All of that helped our backlog reach a record $5.9 billion this quarter. Backlog, as a reminder, is the unrecognized cash licensing revenue for television and theatrical product that will be recognized in the future. So given that we've reached record levels, that obviously gives us great confidence about the long-term growth prospects for the TV business.", "Looking ahead at Warner's to the second half of 2012, we're off to a really great start with the performance of Dark Knight Rises, and we remain optimistic about the performance of our theatrical slate, including releases such as Argo in October and The Hobbit in December. It will also benefit from the continued strong theatrical performance of Magic Mike, which recently crossed the $100 million market at the domestic box office. Just keep in mind that in the third quarter of last year, we had both the theatrical release of the final Harry Potter movie and the syndication of The Big Bang Theory. So as we mentioned to you last quarter, the profit comparisons are more difficult here at the studio in the third quarter versus the fourth. We expect a very strong fourth quarter.", "Moving over to Publishing, where difficult industry conditions were joined by tough comparisons this quarter. Last year's second quarter was the only quarter of the year where revenues were actually up, and that was due in part to some strong special issues. Operating income declined over 40% in the quarter, as a 2% reduction expenses were not sufficient to offset the revenue declines. And looking ahead, the environment here remains challenging, both in advertising and at the newsstand. However, as a result of additional cost measures that have already started to be implemented, expenses should continue to decline year-over-year in both the third and fourth quarters, and the comparisons also get easier here in the second half. So we fully expect to see an improvement in adjusted operating income trends beginning in the third quarter.", "Let me move on now to talk about free cash flow. Year-to-date, we generated about $520 million in free cash, which is similar to the year-ago period, as higher cash taxes and higher interest expenses were offset in part by lower working capital uses. Let me provide a little bit more context around those figures. As we've discussed with you before, our conversion levels of OIBDA, or operating income before depreciation and amortization, into free cash flow last year and this year are somewhat below historical levels. But we fully expect those conversion percentages to begin to increase next year.", "And it's important to look at the key drivers. Over the last few years, our cash taxes have moved to become closer to what the book tax numbers represent, and that's because we've utilized most of our tax attributes. In addition, cash interest costs have risen, in part to fund our share repurchases. Our working capital usage has also risen in the last few years. But unlike cash taxes and interest costs, this should reverse in time. Most of the working capital usage has occurred at Warner Bros. and it's tied to the timing of theatrical production spending and syndication availabilities.", "For example, in certain instances, we have been funding the entire production of less than wholly owned films such as The Hobbit and the Pacific Rim, and we recognized the initial sale of The Big Bang Theory in syndication. As those films are released, and as our syndication partners make cash payments over the life of the contract, these working capital figures will turn around and the cash will flow back to us. And as a result, we expect our working capital needs to decline in future years and our conversion should improve.", "So let me look at the final slide now, which focuses on our net debt. We ended the second quarter with a little less than $17.5 billion in net debt. That's up about $1.4 billion compared to the end of last year. And that's due to our continued returns to shareholders. During the first half of the year, we returned $1.8 billion, which included around $1.3 billion in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've also spent a little bit less than $300 million on M&A activities. This was primarily related to a transaction through which we've recently increased our stake in Central European Media Enterprises, or CME, to nearly 50%.", "So to help maintain strong liquidity and balance sheet flexibility, we also recently issued $1 billion in long-term debt, and we were able to do that at very, very attractive interest rates. Our leverage ratio increased at the end of the quarter to around 2.6x, which is essentially right in line with our long-term target of 2.5x. So we remain pleased with the progress that we're making on our capital plan and our capital allocation so far this year.", "And with that, now let me turn the call back over to Doug and we can begin the Q&A portion of the call. Thanks. Doug?", "Douglas Shapiro", "All right. Thanks, John. Donna, let's get the Q&A started. [Operator Instructions].", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I have 2 quick ones, Doug. One is, just following up on Jeff's comments on the double-digit affiliate growth at Turner, is that on a contract-by-contract basis? Or are you seeing that's going to be the reported growth on the P&L? So just a clarity on what you meant by that.", "John K. Martin", "Michael, it's John. Let me take that. The comment was meant to indicate that -- well, just to take a half step back. Jeff just wanted to remind everybody that our affiliate renewal rate cycle really is about to begin in force sometime mid-next year. And so to try to clarify and provide a little bit more concreteness with respect to expectations from the beginning of the affiliate rate renewal cycle till the end of the affiliate rate renewal cycle, which is the end of '16, our expectations are to achieve double-digit domestic affiliate revenue increases, subscription revenue increases. And so just to give you a sense, if you look at the cable networks line, which is Turner and HBO, that the comments that Jeff made were specific to Turner. So double-digit at Turner. HBO, continue to have expectations of rate going up mid-single digits. As Jeff said, hopefully, we're going to get some unit increases there as well. And then -- and just to give you a sense, at Turner, domestic affiliate revenues are about 80% of the total, so 20% of that is international. So hopefully, that provides a little more clarity.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay, cool. And then the other is a follow-up question, I'll be quick, is just you gave us the $250 million of SVOD money this year. Any sense of where that was last year? So what's the year-over-year change for you guys' SVOD money versus the $250 million this year?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I don't know.", "John K. Martin", "Yes, I don't -- so the $250 million of this year is essentially a full year figure of those deals that we've already got inked. So we'd be hopeful that, that number is actually even going up from those levels, but just wanted to at least give you a sense of where we were to date. We booked year-to-date this year approximately $100 million of that, and last year's full year figure for SVOD was less than $250 million, somewhere around $225 million. Those are the consolidated revenue figures for SVOD. Those do not include the revenues recorded by the CW. We expect revenues recorded by the CW to be somewhere around $80 million, $85 million this year. So just as a reminder, we own 50% of that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "A 2-part question on cable networks, one for Jeff and one for John. First, for Jeff, you mentioned that the ratings softness at CNN and news, I know there was some management changes that have been going on there. Can you just talk a little bit about what the strategy is to reinvigorate ratings at CNN? And secondly, for John, in terms of the ad growth in the fourth quarter from an acceleration standpoint, if you had high-single-digit CPM increases in the upfront, plus the benefit from the NBA coming back, is it possible that ad growth is double digits in the fourth quarter?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Spencer, I'll start with CNN. I think, as we all know, it's a great brand. It's got the biggest reach in the news category, and it's very strong overseas. The biggest reach is domestic. And very strong in online. Having said that, obviously, we're not satisfied with the ratings. They do fluctuate with the news cycle, but we're going to do a better job putting on programming that will hold viewers. We've got more people coming. They're not staying as long as we would like. And so we think there's very strong demand. If you ask where we're aiming, how do we plan to do that: strong demand for objective, comprehensive, nonpartisan coverage, really covering all the partisan views as well. But we need to do it in a very compelling, more engaging way than we've been doing of late. And so that's really what we're going to focus on next.", "John K. Martin", "Spence, it's John. So let me talk about fourth quarter. I think I would say it's too early to tell right now. And let me just give you a few of the things. I mean, I went through them in my proactive remarks. We clearly expect to benefit from the strong upfront results that we had. We're going to benefit from some of the sports timing shifts. We expect to have improved ratings overall, and we have some easier comparisons. And all of that should really drive much, much better advertising revenue growth. Some things to just bear in mind from a reported standpoint though is just, obviously, we're in a situation now where FX translation is a headwind for us. It was a couple hundred basis points of -- well is was actually, for international, it was about 500 basis points of negative growth there in the quarter. And again, that can be fairly volatile and move around, so we don't know exactly where that's going to shake out. And we also have the -- because of the shutdown in Turkey and Imagine, that was -- in terms of advertising revenue, that was about $30 million in the second half of last year that we're going have to comp against. So that's -- again, that's -- we don't have the ad revenues, but we're going to have improved profitability by virtue of not having those networks operating. So yes, I think it's a little too early to predict with a certainty level of specificity, but we feel much better about the advertising trends going into the fourth quarter and, frankly, as we progress into 2013.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Morris from Davenport.", "Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up maybe a little more detail, first of all, on the double-digit outlook for your affiliate growth from 2014 and beyond. Can you maybe split for us a little bit? You have historically talked about the profitability of the NCAA contract and so I'm assuming, and we've analyzed this, that most of those affiliate fee increases will come at TBS, TNT and tru, and that those could be in the mid- to high-teens range. Can you help -- number one, is that where those affiliate increases are primarily coming through? And second of all, how does news factor in? I mean, there is some concern, given the ratings, that maybe you're in a weaker position there as you go into those negotiations. How do you view the potential for news affiliate fee increases?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I'll start, Mike. The affiliate subscriber revenue increases will come across all the networks. I think that the premise of what you were just saying about news isn't right. I think there's tremendous upside on the news side. We think, because of the strength of all of our networks and the fact that we are the company that has more networks in the top 10, the top 40 than any other network company, we don't really have any weak networks. But that supports the ability of the networks to increase subscriber revenues the way that we've said. On your specific point on the NCAA, which is carried on the 3 networks, TBS, TNT and tru, yes, there's -- that will support pretty strong revenue increases on those, and I think the -- what you were putting -- I don't want to really be too specific about it, but the increase you were talking about is too low.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just sticking on the Networks business. John, could you help us just size up HBO versus Turner? And you mentioned international and domestic, but it seems like if the businesses are relatively similar in size on a subscription front, if you get double digits on Turner, you're going to be pretty close to double digits overall since international, I think, is a pretty nice growth story for you guys as well. Maybe you're very high single sort of '14, '15 and '16. I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more help on the base on that front.", "John K. Martin", "I'm going to apologize in advance. I think I've given you guys enough help and you can size the specific pieces of the business. And just to repeat, I mean, we clearly expect affiliate fee growth domestically to be faster at Turner over time than HBO. But HBO, we would expect -- because of the characteristics that Jeff described a little bit earlier, we would be hopeful and we would anticipate somewhat of an acceleration of subscription revenue growth there as well once we start seeing the full impact of the improvements that we've made to the service and we start getting some domestic uplift.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "In terms of volume, domestically and international on top of the rate increase.", "John K. Martin", "Yes. Remember, HBO's international operations, which in aggregate represent about the same percentage as Turner's, it's about 20% of the revenues. But it's a little bit different in the sense that a portion of HBO's less than wholly owned JVs are in their consolidated figures, while a portion of them are accounted for below operating income, but are in pretax income. Suffice to say, that the HBO international operations have been growing much more quickly than the domestic operations, and we would anticipate that to continue as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "A few questions as well. The first, sort of a clarification on the clarification. So I just want to make sure on the language. Between 2013 and 2016, really means 2014, '15, '16 we'd see double digit. And as part of that, what percentage of distribution do you already have sort of under your belt that gives you that kind of visibility on price? That's sort of the first area of questions.", "John K. Martin", "Just from a -- I'll just take the mechanics of it. The answer is yes to your question. Our -- since the renewal cycle doesn't begin until next year, our rates for next year are essentially locked from a pricing standpoint. So it would mean '14, '15 and '16. And we're not going to go into any detail as to percentage of who we've done deals with and so on and so forth. We have an NDA surrounding all of those agreements.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then second question, on international, given the shutdown of Turkey and previously India, has your outlook for international profitability at Turner changed at all? And if you could remind us where 2011 came out for international EBIT and where you had said that would go over time, that would be helpful.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "You want to get that?", "John K. Martin", "Yes, the numbers -- our outlook really hasn't changed all that much for a few reasons. The first is, we had anticipated, coming into this year, a pretty dramatic improvement in the results in each of India and Turkey. And part of the reason why we made the decision that we did is, it was pretty clear early on this year that we weren't going to be anywhere close to what we thought we could achieve. The other thing which is weighing down, again, the reported figures is FX, where we've definitely got a more negative situation in terms of currency translation as compared to what we had thought coming into the year. In terms of international operations in general, let me broaden it out and just repeat what we've said in the past because we still think we're very much on track. Two years ago, we had EBIT, or operating income, of about $500 million internationally in total in our networks. Last year, that grew to $650 million. And we would anticipate that growing to about $1 billion by the end of '14, and we still feel like we're very much on track.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First, Turner was -- has long been seen as kind of a visionary in getting out early in the cable network industry as it was kicking off. And I was curious, as you start to see YouTube evolving as a platform, how do you think about staking out territory there? And how do you want to be positioned vis-\u00e0-vis YouTube? And then two, on Google Fiber, you're not currently participating. Could you just discuss why you're not currently part of the channel package that they're offering? It would just seem to me that the array of virtual or over-the-top MVP -- D players that are coming to the market would improve your leverage with kind of the Comcasts and FiOSs of the world.  Why wouldn't you want to have more distributors over the course of the next 12 or 18 months?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. Thanks, Rich. Let's start with YouTube. I think that's a good premise you have. We're paying very close attention to all the alternative platforms, including YouTube. And we've worked closely with YouTube, mostly as a promotional vehicle. If you look at most of our networks, you're going to find a branded environment for our networks on YouTube. And as YouTube shifts to offer more professionally produced content, we'll look to use that to support our existing networks, possibly to launch some new businesses. But remember, our existing content, mostly exclusive content on Turner and HBO, is available to all subscribers and viewers on demand on broadband already. So we think it's great, the extent to which those can have a presence on YouTube to drive viewership on our networks, but that's basically how we look at it at this point. And we're going to watch it closely. And we're in pretty close communication with YouTube to try to understand how we can work together. On Google's facilities-based service, we're in pretty good discussions with them and are optimistic we'll be able to reach a deal. We're very supportive of companies like, in this case, Google, who is investing to make the infrastructure more robust. And I think the one thing I would say about your question, which we all ought to clarify, it's really important to distinguish infrastructure, consumer distribution, more competition, better quality, more choice for consumers, which Google Fiber does. That is not over-the-top, that's not virtual MSOs. That -- those things don't provide quality, they don't provide infrastructure, they don't improve the consumer experience. So we applaud Google for doing that. We're going to continue to see which ways we can work with them. And I think that you ought to be optimistic that we're going to see -- probably, we're going to be able to help them and they'll be able to help us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have 2 topics. One, if you -- on the -- can you talk what the underlying Publishing advertising was if you pull out the addition of SI.com and Golf.com? And on Publishing in general, I know you've been asked over the years why keep it. And can you just give us your current thoughts on that? And then the second topic is, the buyback slowed down a bit. Is this the pace that we should expect in the second half?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. I'll start with Publishing. Publishing is a strong content business. While the industry is having certainly headwinds in advertising and a little bit of softness during this recession now in readership, it's not been, on the readership side, anything like what's happened in newspapers and things like that. And so as you look at our Publishing titles, which, in most cases, are gaining shares, and as you look at those titles, think of People, In Style, Real Simple, Sports Illustrated, becoming very vibrant on tablets with much more depth of articles and pictures, moving pictures which means video, it's way too reductive to just think that \"Publishing has a constrained future.\" So we think it can grow again, and we think that our publishing company can lead both the evolution and the share gains. When you get to specific advertising questions, I'm going to turn it over to John.", "John K. Martin", "Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Jessica. So let me be a little bit more clear. Second quarter reported ad revenue declined at Time Inc. 7%. The impact of the transfer of SI.com, Golf.com, was about 200 basis points of improvement to Time Inc.'s reported ad growth. So it otherwise would've been down 9%. And that was largely driven by around 8% domestic magazine advertising declines which were pretty broad based. International declined about 4%, and digital was essentially flat for the quarter. So looking into the third quarter, we're seeing fairly consistent advertising trends, maybe a little bit of improved results, digital so far. And we're hoping to get some better results from our non-magazine properties, which were also down in Q2.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "On cap -- you had a capital question?", "John K. Martin", "Yes, on the buyback, we -- year-to-date, our pace through the first half of the year is probably a good indication of what we're likely to do for the rest of this year, because we're really being governed now largely by a combination of earnings growth, free cash flow generation, all within the construct of our balance sheet management and we're right sitting on top of our long-term target ratio of net debt to EBITDA of about 2.5x.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just 2 questions. One, you mentioned the scatter slowing a bit in the third quarter. I guess, can you give us any color about how significant that slowdown is? And is it consistent with what you've seen in the past Olympics? And then just a second question, sort of clarifying your comments on the international outlook or the headwind. I think, in the second quarter, you said that Imagine generated about $30 million ad revenues a year. Is Turkey notable as well? Or is that included in the $30 million revenue?", "John K. Martin", "The question on third quarter scatter and the impact of the Olympics, it's really hard, if not impossible, to exactly tell what the impact of the Olympics is. Although based on us being in the market, we will tell you that we have every reason to believe that it's been quite material in the third quarter. And we would anticipate that those dollars would be redirected in the fourth quarter. And right now, our view, which is optimistic but we think realistic, is that fourth quarter scatter could be quite strong. And then on your second question, on international, could you just repeat it quickly because I just want to make sure that I don't quote a wrong number.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Well I think she was asking -- she said that the Imagine impact was $30 million. How big is the Turkey impact?", "John K. Martin", "Oh, okay. So look -- I mean, in Q3, the combined impact for advertising is roughly $10 million, $11 million. Q4 is almost $20 million. Like I said, it's about -- full year is $60 million all-in, and that's just ad revenue.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Look, it's 100 to 200 basis points a quarter, is the way to think about it.", "John K. Martin", "Yes, yes.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "For both assets?", "John K. Martin", "Correct, yes.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo Securities.", "Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. First, it feels like you don't get much credit from investors for your TV studio performance, given that it's combined with film. I know you break it out in your comments, but any thoughts about separating these into 2 distinct financial divisions so as to maybe unlock some of this value, at least in the eyes of investors? And then the second question is on Netflix. They did make some interesting comments about potentially partnering with HBO. I wouldn't expect this to be a near-term thing, but would this be a consideration at all in the future?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay, TV production, you're right to say that the TV production business is a very attractive and strong business for Time Warner and Warner Bros. We don't, at this point, think that it really makes sense to separate it and fragment reporting further than we already do. We have said we've made the TV production earnings and so forth very clear for years now. And it's a key part of why we're so consistent at Warner, why our cash flow performance is so good in relation to earnings and why we have such visibility in the studio business having strong earnings predictability going forward. And we do encourage, which I think is in your question, for everybody to always focus and think hard about the TV business when they -- and add to that the scale and the tent-pole strategy in our film business, which also allows us to be more stable, really to have consistently superior performance on earnings and cash flow than the other studios with whom we compete. On the Netflix side, look, we -- the press, particularly, goes running, gets very amplifying on anything we've said about Netflix. We've tried to be very constructive and stable over the last 3 years, saying that we thought there was a good role for subscription video-on-demand. We've always said, because this company invented subscription video-on-demand, it's called HBO, and HBO was the first one to go on-demand, both on televisions and now, it's widely available on broadband, HBO. And it's doing really well. And I think Reed Hastings has been very complimentary at certain times about how -- the high regard they have for HBO. And I think we've been complimentary of them in terms of the great work they've done in both the strength of the interface that they've created and the fact that we've proved that people love on-demand programming. That's been the point we've been trying to make to everyone, not just about HBO GO, but about TNT go, CNN on-demand and so forth. And so given the -- all of that, there are not talks going on now between HBO and Netflix because they certainly -- just like all subscription VOD services, HBO, Showtime, Netflix, Amazon Prime, they all compete. And that's probably the primary way that they have a relationship is as competitors. But as you know, in the television and media business, sometimes there are ways for other relationships to emerge over time. Not now, but we'll see in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi Investment.", "Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, I just had a question on HBO GO. Wondering if you could just sort of help us think about how to potentially size the upside to the subscribers if this works? Is it reasonable to assume, over the course of history, that sort of HBO subs have been flat to nominally growing and churn has sort of run in that 4% to 5% range per month? Is that sort of a reasonable proxy?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, that has been the general state of subscription services. If you're asking what's the upside from this, which I think you're right to ask about, we're very pleased with the user data and the satisfaction levels because, if the subscribers really value something, we've seen this with multiplex and video-on-demand, now HBO GO on broadband, what will happen is the subscription levels will go up because either churn will moderate, you'll get more people using it because it's more useful for them, they can be more engaged with the programming. Let me give you a few examples of that. Registered accounts for HBO GO are up 50% since the end of 2011. Monthly plays have increased over 150%, and average monthly usage of the service and HBO programming is increasing. It's really a function of the device rollout, particularly the Xbox 360, which just came on, but we think all devices will be hooked up to it in a way that's easier for people to use. So while it's a little early to discern the impact, all those things are positive. They lead to more engagement and utility for a viewer, therefore, they keep the service. And that's not just in the United States. We've now got that rolling out in all the HBO overseas territories. And I think, as we have noted, we also have -- we're selling HBO programming, and it does really well, in 200 countries where there is no HBO service. So the opportunities for HBO there to sell either maybe an unauthenticated broadband-delivered VOD service remain as upside.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on that last comment. Jeff, I'm wondering if there's any catalyst for an unauthenticated distribution of HBO GO here in the United States? I guess, in the quarter, these online fan campaigns have begun to pop up, HBO fans asking for HBO GO as a stand-alone service. It sounds like this is -- HBO GO is, in some ways, a victim of its own success. And that's why your customers, according to these campaigns, really want HBO GO stand-alone. They say they'd be willing to pay a lot for it as a stand-alone service. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on how Bill Nelson and his team are thinking about that?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes. Well, we, as you of course imagine, we know all of that. And we have the ability to do it. And we will do that if we thought it was in our economic best interest. But right now, we don't think that it is. We have a very good relationship with our distributors. They're in the midst of making HBO GO available in an easy, seamless, high-quality way, which everybody forgets. The broadband infrastructure would have a little difficulty doing that in a consistent way that brings the quality that HBO requires. So right now, the other thing -- I think the mistake everybody makes when they think about that is that there aren't that many homes with broadband and no multichannel TV. So the issue really is, it's not that people want to knock out multichannel TV and have HBO. Most -- it's a question that -- most people have multichannel TV, and there's tens of millions of homes with multichannel TV and they will keep multichannel TV and they aren't currently subscribing to HBO. That's the opportunity. And that gets into a question of -- all those people are hooked up to our distributors, and it's a question of how to have that distribution plans market HBO in a more attractive way. So it's easier for people to hook up and they don't have to, for example, buy things that perhaps they don't want to buy. But the whole idea that there's a lot of people out there that want to drop multichannel TV and just have a Netflix or an HBO, that's not right. Look for the data, you won't find them.", "John K. Martin", "Anthony, do you have a follow-up? We lost you.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from John Janedis from UBS.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Jeff, you mentioned the Cartoon Network and Nick in your prepared remarks. Can you talk about what you saw in the kids upfront? And have you made any changes at Cartoon in an effort to drive share this year?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, we had solid prices in the kids upfront. We're able to take advantage of our ratings growth. News pricing was continuing to trend up in contrast, but the volume was much lighter. So we think that the success of Cartoon lately, and let's not forget the tremendous success of Adult Swim, which is on the channel at night that Cartoon occupies, is a really strong driver for us of advertising. And as -- to get back to the affiliate revenue side, we basically have tremendous upside in the subscriber revenue side of Cartoon Network and Adult Swim.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Okay, and with that, I think we'll cut it off.

I will now turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Time Warner. Please proceed.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter and the other reaffirming our 2012 business outlook. Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site.", "And second, today's announcement include certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Thanks. And with that, let me turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug, and thanks for listening in this morning. Overall, this was another successful quarter for us. As you all know, we face difficult comparisons at Warner Bros. this quarter. But in light of that, I was pleased with our performance. With one quarter left to go, we're on track for another very strong year. To me, the headline this quarter was the continued financial and operational strength at our Networks businesses. Our investments in content and technology over the last few years are clearly paying off, and we expect they'll keep paying off in 2013 and beyond.", "John will walk through the financial results in a few minutes, but before that, I'll share with you some of the key operational highlights from the quarter. I'd like to start with Turner, where we're continuing to see good momentum across most of our Networks. This year, TBS is the #1 network on cable for adults 18 to 34, and it's the #2 network for adults 18 to 49. We posted another great quarter, up 35% in prime time in that demo.", "The Big Bang Theory was again the #1 syndicated comedy on cable this quarter, and that's creating a great platform to launch new shows like Sullivan & Son and Men at Work, and it's lifting the rest of the schedule. Our Tyler Perry-produced comedies were up double digits this quarter, and Conan is the #1 hour-long talk show in late-night among young adults this year.", "We intend to capitalize on our position in coming months as we launch several new originals. We're particularly excited about Cougar Town, which debuts in January. Last month, we announced a new contract with Major League Baseball that provides us TV and expanded digital rights through 2021. Baseball is a marquee property with a long history on TBS. And the post-season games we air are marquee programming for baseball fans and must-have programming for our affiliates.", "Along with our NBA and NCAA rights, keeping baseball on TBS into the next decade helps position us very well for our upcoming affiliate renewal cycle. We also saw a continued improvement at TNT this quarter, highlighted by our originals. New shows like Major Crimes, Perception and Dallas were among the top 5 new series on cable this quarter, while The Closer, Rizzoli & Isles and Major Crimes were the top 3 series on all of cable.", "Typically, we don't program original series against the launch of the broadcast season in September and October. However, we're excited about the line up over the next few months, which should provide a nice boost to TNT's ratings.", "We're thrilled to have the NBA back on TNT after the delayed start that occurred for the season last year. And later this month, we'll also bring back originals like Rizzoli & Isles and Leverage. We'll build on this momentum heading into the first quarter, where we'll have more originals on TNT than ever before, double the number of episodes that we had during the first quarter of 2012.", "We're also seeing continued strong performance for most of our other Networks. truTV just completed its best third quarter ever, and Adult Swim once again finished the quarter as the #1 network among young adults on all of cable.", "One area of challenge remains CNN. Its ratings have improved in recent months due to its distinguished election coverage. And with unmatched global newsgathering capabilities, CNN continues to be the preferred destination for breaking news. That was evident just last week when CNN more than doubled its audience during its coverage of the hurricane while its competitors were only up modestly or they declined. But CNN can do a better job of attracting and retaining audience when news isn't breaking. As you know, we're actively searching for a new leader there, and I expect we'll be able to announce that hire by the end of the year.", "Now I'd shift to our other network business, HBO, which continues to perform at the top of its game. Our big tentpole shows are generating great numbers. Game of Thrones surged to almost 12 million viewers per episode in the second season. True Blood just finished its fifth season, also with 12 million viewers an episode. Boardwalk Empire is pulling in 8 million per episode so far this season, and The Newsroom ended its first season with over 7 million average viewers.", "Underscoring the volume of top-quality shows on the network, HBO won 23 Emmy Awards this year. That's more than any other network for the 11th year in a row. In August, we extended our studio output deal with Fox under what we consider very attractive terms for both of us. That helps guarantee HBO's exclusive access to a critical mass of the best Hollywood movies well into the next decade, thanks in large part to the strength of our programming, the consumer appeal of HBO and MAX GO and greater support from many of our affiliates. Right now, we're seeing the best domestic subscriber trends at HBO that we've seen in years.", "We're posting even faster growth internationally with HBO subs up about 30% so far this year, and we're rolling out new Networks as well. Earlier this year, we launched HBO Netherlands, which is off to a solid start. Later this year, we will launch HBO Nordic, which includes a linear service and our first direct-to-consumer over-the-top HBO offering. And soon, HBO will debut the first premium network in India.", "All the progress we're seeing in our Networks businesses is really the fruit of investments that we've been making for the last few years, investments in content, in technology and investments in our international Networks. And as a result, we've been able to accomplish a lot this year while also closely managing our expense growth.  In fact, so far this year, overall operating expenses at our Networks are up only 2%. I'm not saying we're going to be able to hold expense growth that low every year, but this year's performance reinforces our confidence that we'll be able to drive margins higher over time.", "I'll shift to Warner Bros. starting with our TV studio. WBTV is off to a terrific start this broadcast season. Our returning comedies continue to dominate with The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, Two Broke Girls and Mike & Molly, making up 4 of the top 5 comedies on TV. Among our new shows, Revolution is a breakout hit, it's the #1 new show on TV 18 to 49, and Arrow posted the best debut of any show on The CW in 3 years.", "As we've talked about with you before, Warner Bros. TV benefits from a powerful virtuous circle. Being the leading independent supplier to all the broadcast Networks makes us the preferred home to the top writers and producers on TV which, in turn, makes us indispensable to those Networks.", "Consider this season. WBTV produces the #1 show on television in 18 to 49 on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights. In fact, we produce the #1, the #2 and the #3 shows on television on Monday nights. And while many have taken note of NBC's strong performance so far this season, the untold story is that the top 2 non-sports shows on NBC, The Voice and Revolution, are Warner productions.", "On our theatrical business, the key highlight this quarter was the fantastic performance of The Dark Knight Rises, which pulled in over $1 billion at the global box office, surpassing The Dark Knight. We're off to a great start in the fourth quarter with Argo. Based on its critical acclaim, A+ cinema score and excellent word-of-mouth, we expect it to have a long run in the theaters. And of course, we have high expectations for The Hobbit, which will premiere next month.", "And last, I'll touch on Publishing. Time Inc. is clearly operating on a challenging environment, but we're staying focused on extending our industry leading share, tightly managing our cost base, and of course, maintaining the outstanding quality of our editorial. At the same time, we're positioning the business to grow as it continues to transition to digital. We are leveraging Time Inc.'s core strengths, unmatched scale, a wealth of consumer data and world-class brands to develop new consumer products and new solutions for advertisers.", "So all in all, it was another really productive quarter for us and another indication that the plan we put in place 5 years ago is working. Over that time, we've successfully focused on our content businesses, improved our operating efficiency, reallocated those dollars into content, technology and international investments, and we've actively managed our balance sheet in a way that's improved shareholder returns. We'll never be satisfied or complacent about this progress, but I'm very pleased with the progress we have made and very confident about how we were positioned.", "With that, I'll hand it off to John.", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. During my remarks, I will refer to a presentation that is now available on our website. And the first slide shows the highlights for the quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we knew coming into the year that we'd have very difficult comparisons in the third quarter. And that's because last year, our Film and TV Entertainment segment posted its highest quarterly profits in its history. So in light of that, we're pleased with our results this quarter, and we feel really great about how we're positioned going into both the fourth quarter, as well as into 2013.", "We continue to see healthy underlying trends across most of our businesses, and we had a really, really stand-out quarter at the Networks group, which grew adjusted operating income 12% to post its highest profits ever. We were also able to keep consolidated margins for the quarter steady year-over-year at 23%. In fact, margins were actually up about 40 basis points, and that's despite a decline in revenues. That was a result of a $200 million year-over-year decline in expenses this quarter, which is evidence of our continued focus on improving our operating efficiency.", "Also keep in mind that FX was a drag on revenue of nearly 200 basis points and on adjusted operating income of nearly 350 basis points. So the negative impact of FX took us from otherwise being up in the quarter to being down in the quarter from an adjusted operating income perspective.", "Continuing to move down the P&L, adjusted EPS was up 9% year-over-year, and that's despite the modest decline in adjusted operating income. And that was primarily due to the benefit from our ongoing share repurchase program, as well as a lower effective tax rate. Since we last reported, we've repurchased almost $870 million of our shares, and we paid over $250 million in dividends. So year-to-date, we've deployed about $3.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases, underscoring our commitment to provide ongoing returns to shareholders.", "So we're on track to meet our financial objectives for the year, and this morning, we've reaffirmed our full year outlook for low double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. And given our year-to-date performance, that implies that we're going to end the year on a strong note. And in fact, we expect the fourth quarter to be, by far, our strongest of the year in terms of growth in both adjusted operating income and adjusted net income.", "Now let me turn to the segment highlights, and I'm going to begin with the Networks group where we had significant margin expansion year-over-year, which drove double-digit adjusted operating income growth at both HBO and Turner and record profits for the group in the quarter.", "Subscription revenues were up 7%, and that's despite a drag of about 100 basis points from currency. The increase reflects both higher pricing domestically and international growth, trends that we anticipate will continue moving forward. And as Jeff mentioned, we're also benefiting from domestic subscriber growth at HBO, so we feel good about the trajectory of subscription revenue, and that's before we see the expected benefit from our upcoming domestic renewal cycle at Turner, which will begin to kick in 2014.", "Moving over to Advertising. In total for the quarter, it was about flat. Domestic ad revenue was up modestly year-over-year, and domestic growth was hurt by the timing of the Major League Baseball playoffs and our NASCAR line-up, as well as changes to Turner's digital portfolio. Looking through these, domestic growth was in the mid-single digits up year-over-year.", "International Advertising revenues were down mid-teens in the quarter, but that was impacted by the previous quarter's shutdowns of Imagine and TNT in Turkey. And if it weren't for those shutdowns, as well as FX movements, Advertising revenue internationally would have been down low-single digits. And that's really primarily due to the ongoing economic challenges in Europe.", "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, domestic scatter appears steady with pricing up in the mid-single digits over the strong upfront. Given the improved programming line-up including the NBA, we expect that will translate into mid to high single-digit growth in domestic Advertising. Outside the U.S., we expect to experience a continued impact of the international shutdowns I just mentioned, as well as negative foreign currency movements. So we anticipate that international Advertising will likely be down again in the fourth quarter.", "Moving on, adjusted operating income, as I mentioned earlier, was up a very, very strong 12% in the quarter, and margins were up nearly 250 basis points, reflecting continued strong cost controls, as well as timing of programming and marketing spending. Overall, expenses were flat in the quarter, and they're up only 2% on a year-to-date basis at the Networks segment. And that's despite increased investments in original programming, and as Jeff mentioned, that underscores our confidence in our ability to both aggressively invest in programming, as well as expand margins over time.", "Taking that all into account, our Networks businesses remain well on track to grow adjusted operating income faster this year than we were able to do in 2011.", "Turning now to film and TV where, as I mentioned, we had very tough comparisons. Last year's third quarter was Warner's highest profit quarter ever. And it benefited from the theatrical release of the final Harry Potter movie, as well as the syndication of The Big Bang Theory and Friends. These comparisons masked a couple of very bright spots for us in the quarter.", "The Dark Knight Rises was an absolute blockbuster. It generated in excess of $1 billion at the global box office, and in addition, this quarter, we recognized over $100 million in SVOD revenue, primarily from deals with Netflix and Amazon Prime. And that means that on a year-to-date basis, signed SVOD deals have now risen to be more than $250 million of revenue this year.", "Despite the decline at our TV businesses this quarter due to the tough comparisons that I mentioned previously, we feel very, very good about the underlying trends here, and we're seeing some very promising performances from several of our new and returning shows. As a further reflection of the health of the business, our backlog reached a record $6 billion this quarter. So to provide some context here, that's up over 50% over the past 5 years. And backlog, as a reminder, is cash licensing revenue for television and theatrical product that will be recognized at some point in the future.", "Looking to the fourth quarter, we're off to a terrific start with the performance of Argo, and we're very optimistic about the theatrical release of The Hobbit next month, and we're also excited about the home video release of The Dark Knight Rises and 2 LEGO-branded video games. So we expect Warner is to have a very strong fourth quarter.", "And in thinking about the full year, we continue to expect to be down only modestly at Warner's versus the prior year despite comping against a record year, as I mentioned before, that included a Harry Potter movie, 2 Harry Potter home videos and the syndication of Big Bang. So we expect this year will end up being the second-highest year in profits in the history of Warner Bros. So another very strong year.", "Let me move over to Publishing where we continue to see very tough environment. Advertising revenues declined 5% in the quarter, and that reflected declines both domestically, as well as internationally. Subscription revenues fell as we continue to see softness in newsstand sales. And despite the lower revenues, adjusted operating income actually came in a little higher in the quarter, up 2%, and that was a function of both aggressive cost controls, as well as expense savings resulting from the sale of QSP earlier this year.", "Looking ahead, expenses should continue to decline year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we remain focused on tightly managing costs at this division, but the revenue environment remains challenged. And the absence of QSP will be a drag given the seasonality of what that business was. So unlike this quarter in the third quarter, we anticipate the fourth quarter -- we don't think that expected cost savings will be sufficient to offset revenue declines at the Publishing unit.", "Let me continue to move forward to the next slide, which highlights free cash flow. We had very, very strong quarter of free cash flow generation. We've generated now about $2 billion of free cash flow on a year-to-date basis with a vast majority of that coming in the third quarter, and that's up from a year ago due in large part to lower working capital requirements. And that growth came despite an increase in cash taxes this year. So the decline in working capital is largely a result of the timing of event film reduction, as well as higher reimbursements for co-financed productions. So with our performance through the third quarter, we're on track for another very strong year in terms of free cash flow generation in 2012.", "Let me continue now to the next slide, which is the net debt reconciliation. It's our last slide. We ended the third quarter with about $16.7 billion in net debt, and a leverage ratio of 2.5x, which is right in line with our target. As I mentioned earlier, we've deployed about $3.1 billion in dividends and buybacks this year, and that includes $2.3 billion in share repurchases.", "It also may be worth mentioning that the other line on this schedule consists primarily of stock option proceeds, and that's tied to the strong performance of our stock this year. Year-to-date, we've also spent about $575 million on M&A activity. And in the third quarter, this activity related primarily to our acquisition of Bleacher Report, which is a leading sports digital property and Alloy Entertainment, which is a leading source of IP for TV and web series. These acquisitions are consistent with our track record of tuck-in acquisitions that support our faster growth and our higher return businesses. So with only one quarter left to go in the year, we're quite pleased with the progress that we're continuing to make on our capital plan.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back to Doug, and we'll start the Q&A portion. Thank you.", "Douglas Shapiro", "All right. Thanks, John. So, Dawn, we'd like to get the Q&A started. [Operator Instructions] Thanks.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Two questions, Jeff. On HBO, you mentioned you're having some of the best subscriber result in a long time. I'm wondering if you could talk about the revenue outlook for that business at least qualitatively as well. And in that context, how you're thinking about a dollar of investment on originals versus movie output? You mentioned the Fox deal. It certainly seems like original programming is really driving that business now. So I'm wondering how you think about maybe rebalancing that over time? And John, just quickly on The Hobbit. It's a unique relationship with MGM. Anything we should be considering on working cap or P&A as this is a late quarter release. Just any comment that we might need to help us would be great otherwise.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thank you. HBO will see revenue on the programming. The revenue growth has been very steady as you know, and the fact that the subscriber grows domestically, picking back up, and internationally increasing nicely and pretty significant increase in international sub revenue is really helpful for us in terms not just earnings and growth of earnings, but also investment in programming for then further strength of the Subscription service and then further revenues for both electronic sale and international sale of the program. So we're continuously investing. As we said in the prepared remarks, we've got a bigger slate of originals with more success, more hits and more audience for the originals than we've ever had before. We've got really strong growth in demand for our originals from our growing overseas HBO network. And in other countries from other Networks that really like the quality of HBO programming travels very well. So it's a very strong model in terms of revenue growth and in terms of investment in programming. What we're going to do in terms of balancing original versus other kinds of programming is something we're thinking about. There is a pretty strong utility for movies in the right mix or HBO being so many Networks that are 24 hours a day. Having said that, we've got more flexibility in how we judge the balance of movie programming on HBO and Cinemax and original programming than we had before, and so we, basically, are very happy with the trends at HBO, both on the revenue side, on the strength of the brand and on the programming side. And I would just finish by saying we ought to think about HBO GO, Cinemax GO, which are not only here in the United States and increasingly being seen by subscribers of things that are easy to use and they're getting used to using them, but they've now launched the on-demand product over most of the HBO network footprint around the world. So things are just going extremely well in our HBO business.", "John K. Martin", "So, Ben, let me address your question on The Hobbit, and then I'll come back and maybe make a comment or 2 about overall Warner Bros. fourth quarter expectations where we do expect a very, very strong quarter from Warner's in Q4. So if you look at The Hobbit, let's talk cash versus P&L. On the cash, I think we've mentioned this before, we've been essentially financing the entire production cost of all 3 of the movies, and we have an arrangement whereby we'll recoup the portion of the financing that isn't attributable to us over time, and we'll do that including -- with a financing element in there with the cost of money element in there, too. And we have the distribution rights for The Hobbit. So from a cash standpoint, a lot of the cash has already been spent, which is one of the reasons why we've had some working capital spikes from a usage standpoint. We've said that, that will turn around over time, and it's one of the reasons why we're not worried about increasing capital intensity in the businesses, particularly at studio. If you think about the P&L, when you have these late-in-the-year releases, you are bearing a significant portion of the P&A associated with those. And a lot of the benefits from the release and the movies will come in over time. So a lot of the benefits from the first Hobbit release will be -- will actually be realized in 2013 and then beyond. To put it in perspective, each of The Lord of the Rings movies did at least $1 billion at the box office. We anticipated that this is going to be a blockbuster release, and we were very optimistic for it. Fourth quarter, in general, we think will benefit from The Hobbit, although as I mentioned, more of the benefit will come in over time. But we also have the strong results of Argo, we've got The Dark Knight DVD, we probably will have lower P&A on fewer releases coming out of the studio, and we expect a very strong quarter from our Home Entertainment Group as we expect higher margin mix of product.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I have one for Jeff and one for John. Jeff, just going back to comments you made the last quarter on your affiliate fee expectations, I wonder if you could talk a bit about how you could use HBO or may not use HBO to negotiate concurrently with Turner. Is that something you're thinking about? And do you have the overlap in the cycle to do that?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, well, as you can imagine, we don't really want to discuss our negotiating tactics and strategy with all 300 of you, but I think it's a good question. And please remember, and we did say this, that Turner, on a standalone basis, is one of the largest cable network groups just by itself. And of course, I think as your question implies, if you have Turner and HBO combined, we're the biggest cable network group in the world. So you can imagine that, that does give us some alternatives, I guess. So we, of course, we need to gather continuously to figure out how to best serve our affiliates and make sure that the value of our Networks are recognized and to bring the right scale and the right flexibility to each of the affiliate negotiations. They're not all exactly the same situation, and we try to organize ourselves appropriately for everybody's benefit, including ours.", "Douglas Shapiro", "There might be another question for John?", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Yes, John, we had assumed this year, I think, based on your comments, that programming expense of networks will be up mid- to high-single digits. Given your trend so far first 3 quarters, do you still feel that's a good range or maybe the lower end of the range is more appropriate?", "John K. Martin", "I think the lower end of the range is more appropriate for this year. And thanks for the question. Look, we said coming into the year, a lot of people were asking questions about expense growth overall, programming expense growth. In particular, if you look at the margin enhancement that we had in Q3, and I would suggest that Q4 will probably look similar, we grew margins in a big way at each of HBO and Turner during the quarter. And we'll do so again next quarter. But as we always mentioned to you, quarters, in any particular quarter, things can move around and change. But when you look at annual cycles which is how we plan and run the businesses, we expect the margins for the Networks group this year in 2012 will be up versus last year. And we would anticipate those types of trends continuing in the future. And I would suggest that we are investing fully in the programming of these Networks. We have huge scale programming budgets, which we think is an advantage versus the competition, and we have a lot of elements of our programming line-up that have very modest growth elements included in them. So when you look at the overall average growing in the mid-single-digit range, that does include a meaningful increase in investment in original programming, and we would expect continued ability to have tight cost controls going forward.", "Operator", "We have John Janedis from UBS.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Jeff, with new MLB deal and what seemed to be some fairly healthy step-ups in sports rights broadly on renewed contracts, can you talk about your view on sports rights going forward at Turner and whether you feel a need to possibly stretch for maybe another franchise if it were to become available?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, okay. Look, we think we're in very good position with the sports rights we have now. And the NCAA deal that we did has been a very successful deal in terms of viewership, in terms of Advertising recovery, and we fully anticipate and we've had some experience to support this, that it's going to hold up very well in terms of our affiliate pricing moves. We are well positioned for -- to deal with the renewal of the sports that we already carry, including NBA, and so as we think about other things, and I assume you're asking about potential other decisions like NFL packages, and so forth, it's a little speculative to talk about that. We don't need such a thing, but it's not to say that depending what the package would be, so it might not be something that we could bring an economic advantage for. Sports can be a very important part of the offering in Turner. We just need to have the right ones, and we take out a very -- we think well-balanced arrangement between the sports, the originals and the acquired programming. But if the -- if an NFL package came up, and I think they're considering how they want to handle that, just like the NCAA, we would consider it, but we'd only do something of that size if we were confident that we could monetize it and have it improve our economics. So I know that's a theoretical answer, but it's, at this point, not clear what the choices are.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen from Bank of America.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess one for Jeff and one for John. Jeff, as the largest TV producer in one of the largest cable network groups, I mean, you're obviously in a position of leadership in the television industry. And I'm just curious on your view of this current season's ratings volatility, which will only be exacerbated by the rollout of TV Everywhere. This lack of appointment in just watching on different devices at different times, how does it affect your different businesses? And what do you think the TV industry will do about it?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We see the general trends is good, but let me say why that is. I know there's been a lot of concern about the early broadcast ratings, and as you know, we have a very strong supplier relationship, 25 shows across all the broadcast Networks. We're the only one to have not only one show in every Network, but 2. Our shows are doing great. Some of the biggest hits are from Warner Bros. But it's only been a few weeks, and broadcast audit last year are very strong. Cable ratings because, we had to look at all sides of this, have been stable, and there's a lot of viewing, particularly on cable, that's happening on the VOD side that's getting added to the consumer loyalty and engagement with the shows and with the Networks. So some of the pressure on broadcast ratings is clearly coming from viewing on alternative platforms. And while it isn't being measured as well as it will be soon, I think what you'll see eventually, because VOD does this whether it's VOD on your television, through your cable or telco operator, whether it's VOD that you're using for HBO GO or TV Everywhere, it increases viewership. It increases the value of hit shows. It increases the value of Advertising if you put the Advertising into the right format. So from a Network point of view, these are good trends for us. From the point of view of Warner, as the lead supplier, we think it's fine. And bear in mind, we have a growing business in making shows at Warner for cable Networks and even increasingly for Internet to view as well.", "Operator", "I have Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital IQ.", "Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research", "I have one question for John and one for Jeff. So, John, it would appear to me that the pace of your share buyback program accelerated after the end of the quarter and -- but even if that's the case, it also appears that between buybacks and dividends, you are significantly running behind the last year's pace even as your free cash flow for this year is significantly up. So I'm wondering how much of that is kind of a deliberate policy to slow down your buybacks and potentially now that we have certainty on the presidential elections, how this could skew your capital return program potentially on the dividends by next year. If you can give us physically some peek into your program for next year, that would be helpful. And I have a question for Jeff.", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Tuna. Thanks for the question. Look, I think our capital program and our capital plan has been very, very consistent now for a long time. And we have no intention of straying away from that. Last year, you made a comment that the pace of the buyback this year was behind last year's pace. I'd ask you to remember last year, we were in the process of increasing leverage on the balance sheet to try to get to the long-term leverage target of 2.5x. We achieved that, and now for the foreseeable future, we're using that 2.5x leverage as a guide post in figuring out how we're going to deploy capital. I would also say because you said it looks like this pace of the buyback sped up a little bit recently, I would acknowledge that to be true. I think as I mentioned on my proactive comments, we've seen a significant amount of cash proceeds coming in from stock option exercises. So that's given us some excess capacity to deploy, and we still view the stock as being extremely attractive at current levels. And we've been trying to deploy the capital in a way where it's sensitive to shareholder returns, and it's staying within the constraints of our 2.5x leverage target. So I think going forward, that's probably the best benchmark to look to in terms of determining what we're going to do.", "Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research", "Okay, that's helpful. So here's the question for Jeff and maybe John, you can also chime in. As I look at the home video and electronics delivery revenues, it appears that there's a secular bifurcation, for lack of a better word, between those 2 categories. Presumably some of that has to do with the discrepancy in Netflix revenues between film and television. But even if you strip out Netflix, I'm trying to understand perhaps if there is indeed a secular bifurcation there and what might be attributable to that, Jeff, in the context of some of the initiatives you're pursuing, whether it's UltraViolet or TV Everywhere.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Tuna, do you mind clarifying, you were asking in the home video business, this is physical, electronic sell-through, SVOD, et cetera, whether there's a bifurcation between what and what.", "Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research", "Between film, the theatrical and the television product?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Film and TV. Boy, we're all thinking about it because we obviously didn't think there was such a thing. Film is the biggest category. It's been interesting, and you had essentially a little stabilization in the overall home video business. The electronic sell-through side has started -- and SVOD side has started to do a little better. To your point on television -- no, no, let me finish film. So film's done a little better. There's been a bit of a shift or, let's say, growing strength in the alternative electronic sales aspects of film, whether it be SVOD or just the FT, a little bit of help in Blu-ray as well on the physical side. But if you then ask if this is your question, whether television products, series product, has done a little well in home video and particularly VOD, yes, it has. That's probably because -- so TV series products has held up better. And that's because probably, in fact, it is because there's been more sale of series per VOD consumption to the subscription services like Netflix and Amazon and Hulu Plus than there was previously. And that is something that as we've talked about on these calls for several quarters, we all expected that to happen. It's a more natural place for, basically, a syndication window, television product to go to subscriptions VOD services. And those are less rational places for kind of first-run films to go.", "John K. Martin", "The only thing I would add, Tuna, is if you were asking us the question specific to Warner's versus the industry, I would just add that in any particular quarter, those categories can move around quite a bit, and that's really nothing to do with secular. That's just availability of product.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I have 2 questions for anybody that wants to answer them. The first one is on the share count. Sort of despite the big numbers, I think, you put up in terms of the money you spent buying back stock, it looks like the average diluted share count is kind of flattish sequentially versus the prior quarter. So I'm wondering what -- can you help explain what's going on there? And what the trends would look like going forward? And the second question is, could you break out of the $200 million of the SVOD licensing kind of broadly what percent comes from TV licensing and what percent comes from film?", "John K. Martin", "Sure. Maybe I'll take a crack at both of them. I think in the overall share count, remember what we disclosed are averages, too. So it's being impacted over a period of time. The buyback was being somewhat -- the pace of the number of shares that we were able to buy in was being somewhat impacted by the fact that share price has gone up. So that, in and of itself, would change the velocity of the shares being taken in. And then I didn't know if your question was basic versus fully diluted. Fully diluted would have always had the impact of the options in there, but the options were more in the money. And they've actually now to the extent that they've been exercised, they're actually in the authorization in the issued account.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So has there been an acceleration of exercise that sort of slows the diluted share count decrease or?", "John K. Martin", "Not if you were looking fully diluted to fully diluted. But the price -- the fact that the price went up would have somewhat of an impact on that. It's the fact that the price went up mechanically is the single biggest driver. They're probably the trend that you're seeing.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "But there's options in money -- were more in the money before, which is a lot.", "John K. Martin", "So -- and on your SVOD, just some context in terms of the amount of revenues that we book to-date. We're now north of $250 million. We remain in constructive dialogue and constructive conversations with a number of SVOD companies. So there's a good chance that, that number could go up before the end of the year. But if you look at the $250 million and break it out, roughly 2/3 of it is TV versus film. And Netflix comprises probably around 40% to 45% of the total. We've sold a meaningful amount of product to Amazon and the Amazon-owned LOVEFiLM. So that's about $100 million, and about 2/3 of the money has been domestic with a full 1/3 of it coming internationally. So that'll just give you a little bit of a sense of we are doing business with multiple players. We're doing business around the world, and we see greater opportunities in the future to sell deeper amounts of our product.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And if you look at that 2/3 of TV versus film, is it possible to break that down by the sort of WB-related stuff as opposed to just Warner studio?", "John K. Martin", "I think I mentioned that Netflix was about 40% to 45% of the total, around $250 million. Most of that is CW, but not all.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "CW, I'm sorry.", "John K. Martin", "Majority of it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. First, Jeff, you've talked a lot about the need for innovation and adjusting to kind of a change in consumer behavior. We've seen the theatrical, the home video window creep a couple of weeks closer, but it's still months between the 2 distribution platforms. I was wondering, how do you get the industry to affect greater change than what we've seen so far? And then two, I think we're big believers that HBO, it doesn't make sense for HBO to go direct to consumers given its overall model. But you all at Warner Bros. create a tremendous amount of high quality original programming. Why haven't we seen you go direct-to-consumer with a new network kind of aimed at a broadband offering of high-quality content?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Rich. Let me do them in that order. So in terms of innovation and adjusting to change in consumer habits, we are trying to do what you're saying. And I think you're rightfully asking well, how do you get it faster, how do you get it more massively influential to serve consumers? We've been trying with Blu-ray, with SVOD coming up and cooperating with them, with window experiments I think the Fox early electronic sale window is something that all of us have -- and all of us saw releasing movies to try to see if that will help. For example, last 4 major WB releases have had at least a 2-week ESP window in the United States, and so we are approaching it case-by-case. But we're all moving in that direction as you said. You know it, all of you know it, that there are some very big partners in retail and theatrical that were trying to make sure that they are part of the transition and that their liability as premier platforms is increasingly strong. And let's not forget that the technical quality and experience of people in theaters and of people getting home video now electronically, not just physically, through all those huge systems is very important. What we're trying to do with UV and some of our other plans that we've actually been the leader of is to try to make the choice between rental and sale viable on both. We're trying to make the experience better and easier for both, and we think pricing will follow the convenience and demand that consumers express as they try to adopt these new ways. So that's your first question. The second question, which is, and I agree with you on the HBO decision for now. But given the content we're making at Warner's, the simple answer is that the concept of a subscription broadband network isn't that ready for prime time. If you look at those that exist, Netflix is the biggest, there are several more we all know, they're doing fine. They're clearly adjusting. The utility they seem to bring to consumers is a good interface and really the only real accessible way to get things on demand. What they are less servicing in terms of providing what consumers need is they don't really have fresh programs. And so I think your question goes to that. We are making programming that's on a lot of Internet channels. Some of it's on YouTube. We're trying to figure out what is the best economic house, what's the most monetizable for original programming that's obviously going to be seen on the VOD method. If you were talking about a, let's call it an Internet network on demand that comes out of a producing company, Warner Bros., it's not clear that's the best way to offer genres to customers. I mean, there's plenty of branded Networks that can offer VOD and Internet-delivered programming to consumers where the show when we make it is both more valuable to us and more easy for consumers to use if it comes in the branded network where they expect to see it. Comedies are different than dramas. Doesn't really make sense to us to create an all-genre Network on VOD and put it out over the Internet at this point. And we think it's more likely that the current Networks, which are very successful, they're very strong at developing appropriate programming for consumers where consumers know how to find it, they go to the Food Network expecting something different than where -- what they go to TBS for, MTV, et cetera. We think that's more likely to be where the outlets go.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "I asked because you were early in the premium cable space. You really defined cable television as the medium took off with HBO that now dominates the space in terms of quality of programming. And it just seems like from a broadband standpoint, we're still so early in the broadband video evolution. It just seems like you have an opportunity to do that or you're in a unique position to do something there.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, I'm not -- I don't want to rule it out exactly, but the -- if you think, Rich, of this huge, huge demand for original programming, it's coming from all of the existing Networks and now the SVOD Networks. It's a tremendous kind of demand for us to program to and sell to. And the question I think you're asking is creating Networks with specific either narrow-genre definitions or all-genre definitions, you'd have to figure out which of those 2 things was really the key thing to do. It's not, in our view, because we have the capability of making a lot of programming across all genres. We all know that. We're doing it now, and we're the lead supplier, basically, of everything to every existing Network. So it's -- so far we think that's the better way to play it and we have, as you know, our own Networks, which we can broaden, whether it's TNT or TBS, whether it's truTV, Adult Swim, HBO, Cinemax, et cetera. So we're probably headed in that direction instead.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I'm going to switch to some numbers questions for John. I've got a few, but they're all short. You gave a nice breakdown of SVOD revenues. How are you indexing at this point versus competitors? Have you caught up in terms of monetization?", "John K. Martin", "Doug, I appreciate the question. I actually don't know because while we pay attention to our competitors, I don't know exactly what's in all of their numbers. I would tell you, I don't -- I would guess that we're probably at or near the top. And as I said, there's a lot of constructive discussions continuing. By the way, the numbers that I gave you do not include the revenues that are recorded at The CW, which we're an equity partner in. But The CW did a very significant deal, and there are probably $60 million to $70 million of revenues recorded at The CW this year, too. So we're -- philosophically, we see SVOD as a very, very big opportunity for us. I think we've been very clear about the types of programming that we're willing to sell and in what windows. And I think there's a lot of opportunity ahead.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "What's the cadence? Did the 2012 deals create a tough comp for 2013, or does it smooth out because you do deals every year?", "John K. Martin", "I don't know exactly. But my strong suspicion is that we're not going to have a big negative comparison next year because a lot of these deals are multi-year, and availabilities are coming in throughout them. I know that's the case with The CW and with Hulu, and some of these smaller deals is probably the same. So we're building in, basically, a recurring revenue stream, and we're hoping to grow off of that.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I would just add, since we have more series and movies than basically anybody else, if the SVOD companies are able to grow, then further answer supporting what John said, our revenues will be continuous and go up.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Makes sense, and then lastly, do you see them boosting -- being boosted by the election in 4Q? And I was hoping you would share the entertainment Networks ad pacing for 4Q because that might help us care forward the growth in x news into 2013.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Let me just start by saying that CNN won the night last night. And that's always good. In terms of the fourth quarter, you're asking not in news because you started with the election, you're asking about ad revenues for our entertainment Networks in the fourth quarter?", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, John said that it was mid to high-single digits. So and I'm wondering if that's being boosted by CNN or held back by CNN.", "John K. Martin", "CNN is benefiting from the election, and it's probably pacing in and around that mid to high-single digit overall figure. We obviously have a portfolio of Networks, and the scatter commentary that I gave is overall by definition kind of an average, but we have seen some mixed demand across different and various categories. Domestic entertainment is pretty good. News has been pretty good, boosted by the election. We have seen some light demand in kids, including our Adult Swim. That can change, but that's just been as of late in Q4, and a little bit of a slowdown in sports because there's a lot more inventory in the market this year because of the NBA versus a year ago. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag. Overall, it feels pretty steady though. And CNN's results, clearly, relative to the last 3 quarters, have been boosted by the election.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna Financial.", "Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I have one on HBO and one on Turner Networks quickly. Jeff, how high quality is the subscriber growth at HBO? I'm just thinking back to 2010 when HBO was penalized for one of your distributors' promotional subscribers rolling off. So if you could tell us probably what you think is driving that because it's certainly not pay TV, total pay TV addressable market growth. And then how confident are you that TBS ratings will hold up now that we are about to start lapping the improvement last December when you put Big Bang Theory on. So if you could give us an idea of how broad the ratings recovery is, and what we should be expecting in terms of comps there?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay, on HBO, the quality and the mix between HBO and Cinemax and promotional subs and paying subs is quite good. It's normal for us. Basically, there's an overall buoyancy to sub growth at HBO and Cinemax across the affiliate base and across the Networks, that's domestically. International, that's equally true. So just to remind you, when we had the -- I think everybody wondered a few years ago when we had a drop on promotional subs, it had to do with a couple of big affiliate deals that we're renewing and therefore, they were dropping off nonpaying subs. And we always have some of those, but what we're saying in answer to your question is, this is broad-based sub growth across the categories. And so you should view it as representative of the future of the network. On the question you had on where was this on...", "Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "TBS ratings coming up on The Big Bang Theory?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, okay. Well, so as you all know, we've had TBS, a huge ratings success growth 30% plus from that show at TBS. You can't expect to keep doing that once that's in the mix. So we're really confident that The Big Bang Theory will hold up. We have a very strong -- and the reason is, it's not being overexposed. Most viewers of it are watching a couple of episodes a week. It's a completely fresh show for most of our viewers because most of them did not see it on CBS, and so we have no concerns about Big Bang's very strong contribution to the network being erratic are going away. We think it will be very solid and very predictable for us. We also though because of the strength of Big Bang, lifting the rest of the schedule, giving us a place to launch other shows, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that it lifted, say, the Conan show and some of the rest of the schedule, but just looking at launching new originals, part of the reason that Men at Work and Sullivan & Son succeeded as well as they did is that they were launched on the strength of that audience base that Big Bang provided. And we're going to follow those up with Wedding Band, another original comedy we're launching this month. And we're very excited, as we said, about the arrival of Cougar Town early next year. So that's going to give us original shows added to the mix. We think our acquired shows are going to hold up. We've got several new unscripted shows slated for next year. One of them is called King of the Nerds. And I know all of you will want to turn into that as we will hear. We're also going to get the syndicated run of the Cleveland show next year. Finally, on a longer-term basis, and this is really thinking of the strong balance position that TBS has, both with originals and the strength of acquiring and our access to acquire from the biggest producer of those years, which is Warner Bros., we've got Two Broke Girls coming for 2015. So as we look out over the long run, we plan our original development, we plan our acquired budget, we look out at what is successful on Network TV and which shows we want, we feel that we're in a very good position to keep building at TBS.", "Douglas Shapiro", "All right thanks, everybody, for dialing in today.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Ellen, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Time Warner. Please proceed.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks, and good morning. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full year and the other providing our 2013 full year business outlook.", "Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site.", "And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug, and thanks for listening in today. 2012 was another successful year for us, and we're at an even stronger position today than we were a year ago. Adjusted operating income was up 4%, and adjusted earnings per share climbed 13%. Looking back over the last 4 years, adjusted OI has grown at 10% per year, and adjusted EPS has grown by more than 20% per year, or over 130% cumulatively.", "Our networks, which is the core of the company, grew adjusted operating income in the double digits in 2012 and 12% annually over that same 4-year period.  At the same time, in 2012, we continue to build a foundation for strong ongoing growth in 2013 and beyond. And as you saw this morning, we once again expect to deliver low double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth this year.", "We also continue to return capital to our shareholders, last year, paying $1 billion in dividends and purchasing more than $3 billion of our stock. That's more than 8% of our outstanding shares. Since we restarted our share repurchase program in 2009, we've bought back more than 1/4 of our equity base.", "Reflecting our continued commitment to return capital, this morning we announced that our board has approved a new $4 billion repurchase authorization and an 11% increase in our dividend per share. That's the fourth consecutive year of double-digit dividend increases.", "Our performance in 2012 and our expectation of continued strong growth are the products of the strategic priorities that we've put in place several years ago and which we continue to pursue today. They may not sound new to you, but one of the hallmarks of a sound strategy is that it doesn't change too often.", "First and foremost, we're investing aggressively in our content. Second, we're pushing to develop the next generation of digital business models in ways that enhance value to consumers and to the company. Third, we're seeking to replicate our domestic success in the most attractive international territories. And fourth, overlaying everything we do as a continuing effort to improve our operating and capital efficiency.", "I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about how we executed against these objectives in 2012 and how we aim to do it again in 2013. And I'll start with our first priority, and that's our content.", "At Turner, in 2012, we continued our path of refreshing essentially the entire prime time lineup on TNT and TBS over a multiple-year period. Last year, we had more original programming on our entertainment networks than ever, including new originals like Dallas and Perception on TNT and Men at Work on TBS. We also bolstered our lineup of new acquired shows, adding The Mentalist and Castle on TNT and securing 2 Broke Girls for TBS in 2015.", "And we extended our relationship with Major League Baseball, securing rights to regular season games and postseason games well into the next decade. So with the NCAA, NBA, NASCAR and baseball, we have the strongest lineup of national sports rights of any cable network other than ESPN's group.", "For the most part, these efforts are paying off. In 2012, TBS was the #1 ad-supported cable network in prime for adults 18 to 34, and it was #3 for adults 18 to 49. At TNT, while we have more work to do, ratings improved over the course of the year, and it ended 2012 as the #4 cable network in prime among adults 18 to 49. TNT also claimed 5 of the top 10 cable originals of the year: The Closer, Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes, Perception and Dallas. And TNT had the top 3 new originals of the year on cable.", "We delivered continued solid performance across our more targeted networks. For the year, Adult Swim was again the #1 cable network in total day for young adults; Cartoon ranked #1 in total day for boys 6 to 11 and boys 9 to 11; and truTV was close to a top 10 network in prime among men 18 to 49.", "CNN finished the year on a high note, thanks to its election coverage. And while its overall ratings performance in 2012 fell short of our expectations, I'm optimistic that with the new leadership we've announced, CNN will once again fulfill the promise of its iconic brands.", "As we've discussed with you before, over the next several years, we'll be increasingly focused on monetizing these investments in content as we enter our next round of affiliate renewals. We also told you that we expect Turner's domestic subscription revenue to grow at a double-digit compound annual growth rate between 2013 and 2016. And as we get closer to starting the renewal process, we're as confident in that forecast as ever.", "In addition to monetizing this content through traditional revenue streams, we also started to license Turner content to SVOD providers. In the last few months, Turner and Warner Bros. together announced deals with both Amazon and Netflix, licensing serialized shows such as Dallas and Falling Skies, along with animated series from both Cartoon Network and Adult Swim. This emerging back end for cable originals is a very promising sign since it should result in production values for cable originals getting even better over time.", "In 2013, we'll do even more of the same. That includes airing originals on TNT and TBS year round and increasing the number of original episodes on those 2 networks by more than 40%. We'll do that within the cost growth envelope that we've discussed with you before.", "At HBO, our content lineup is the best it's ever been, and it just keeps getting better. In 2012, we added several popular and critically acclaimed new shows like the Newsroom, Girls and Veep to a schedule that already included blockbuster series True Blood, Game of Thrones and Boardwalk Empire. Underscoring the amount of quality programming on that network last year, HBO won more Emmys than any other network for the 11th year in a row. It also just received more Golden Globes than any other network, too.", "As usual, last year, HBO also offered by far the largest slate of Hollywood blockbusters of any premium network, roughly 1/2 of the top 25 films in the pay window. In recent months, we've extended our output deals with both Fox and Universal, helping solidify HBO's leading position on theatrical films well into the next decade.", "The strength of this programming on HBO and Cinemax and the success of HBO GO and MAX GO helped generate the best subscriber gains in a decade. Both brands are an improvement at virtually all of our major affiliates. Together, they added 1.9 million subscribers domestically for the year.", "At Warner Bros., our investments in great storytelling also paid off last year, enabling us to post the second-highest annual profits ever, even without a Harry Potter release. Our TV studio was again the leading producer of broadcast TV programming in the 2012-2013 season. With hits like The Big Bang Theory, The Voice, Revolution, Two and a Half Men, 2 Broke Girls, The Following, Mike & Molly and Person of Interest, Warner's now accounts for 1/3 of the top shows on broadcast TV with adults 18 to 49, including 3 of the top 4 comedies on television.", "Our game plan in 2013 is the same, to foster the best possible environment for the best writers and producers in Hollywood. And we expect another very good year. As you know, we're seeing great secular dynamics in TV production right now with increasing demand from all our buyers, broadcast, cable originals, off-mix indication, international and subscription VOD.", "For instance, besides the deals that Warner Bros. and Turner struck with Amazon and Netflix, which I mentioned earlier, in recent months, Warner's also cut a comprehensive slate deal with Netflix for new serialized shows in the U.S., as well as a series of agreements internationally, including Canada, Latin America, the U.K. and Ireland and the Nordic region. These deals boost our confidence that we'll be seeing strong SVOD revenues again in 2013 and beyond.", "We also had a great year at the film studio, led by The Dark Knight Rises, which grossed $1.1 billion at the global box office, making it the highest grossing film in the franchise. We also have the first part of The Hobbit trilogy, which is on track to reach $1 billion globally; Magic Mike; and the multiple award-winning film Argo.", "Driven by countries like Brazil, Russia and China, we're increasingly seeing international box office totals outstripping domestic box by more than 2:1 for our biggest hits. It's hard to top that, but our 2013 theatrical slate looks even better. It includes Man of Steel, The Hangover 3, Great Gatsby, Pacific Rim, the sequel to 300 and, of course, the second film in The Hobbit series. In fact, that was all content.", "So turning now to our second main priority. In 2012, we continue to lead the digital transition across our businesses. At our networks, Turner expanded its TV Everywhere offerings, adding new platforms and new apps. Turner's TVE services are now available to over 80 million households, and we offer over 1,000 hours of on-demand content and our first live streaming app for CNN.", "Adoption of TV Everywhere clearly has not progressed at the consumer level as fast as we would have liked. However, with growing availability of authenticated content for many of our cable programming peers slated for 2013 to finally joining us, we expect much greater consumer awareness and usage starting this year.", "At HBO, HBO GO and MAX GO are now available to essentially our entire domestic subscriber base, and they're available across a wide variety of devices and platforms, including iOS, Android, Kindle and Xbox. As we've discussed with you before, we've seen very healthy usage, and consumer satisfaction is through the roof. Gross subs said they are more loyal to HBO and they're watching more HBO, and monthly usage per user climbed 80% between the end of 2011 and 2012.", "We've also just launched a program to bundle in HBO GO on college campuses to help us attract the next generation of HBO subscribers. We're rolling out GO as an authenticated product where we have linear networks internationally, too. It's now available in 10 countries in Central and Northern Europe and 8 countries in Latin America. This year, we'll start to launch in Asia.", "At Warner's, as you know, we're spearheading a number of initiatives to improve the consumer proposition of buying and owning digital movies. UltraViolet has only been in the market for a short time, but it's gaining momentum. UV is now supported by almost every major studio. Over 8,500 titles are available in the UV format, and it has more than 9 million registered users.", "In 2013, we expect to see a lot more retailers coming on board. Flixster and the other providers are also launching in-home disc-to-digital services that allow consumers to unlock the digital rights to their physical DVDs right from their home computers. With UV already available in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., this year, we also plan to roll it out in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand.", "Time Inc. significantly expanded its digital efforts in 2012, too. That included launching", "[Audio Gap]", "iOS, Android and Kindle platforms, and we've seen some encouraging signs so far. For instance, our tablet subscribers are younger, they have higher incomes, and over 70% of them have never subscribed to those titles before.", "A third priority I mentioned earlier is expanding our presence internationally in key territories, particularly our network businesses. Turner is focused on increasing its scale in each of its targeted territories, including investing more in local production and securing distribution from new networks in countries where we already have a presence. We're also looking to significantly streamline our operations in areas where we don't have scale like Western Europe.", "HBO is following the same playbook internationally that succeeded so well domestically, increasing local production and rolling out product enhancements like HD, On Demand and now, HBO GO. It's working. HBO and Cinemax grew to 73 million subscribers internationally. That's up more than 35% from the end of 2011. Adding in our domestic cap, HBO now has 114 million subs globally. That's far more than any competitor. And HBO is also expanding into new territories. Last year, we launched new HBO premium services in the Netherlands and the Nordic region, and we announced plans for the first premium TV service in India.", "The fourth and final objective I mentioned earlier is one that informs everything else we do, and that is continual striving to improve our operating and capital efficiency. And reflecting that focus in 2012, total operating expenses actually declined 2% even as we invested more in content. We may not be able to replicate that every year, but closely managing our expense growth has become a way of life at Time Warner. As one example, we're making progress on our enterprise services initiative that will ultimately improve the efficiency of certain IT, real estate and HR functions. In 2013, that will require some additional investment, but we expect to ultimately save several hundred million dollars annually on a run-rate basis. And at the same time, we know that active balance sheet management is a critical component of equity returns. Over the last 4 years, we've generated $11 billion in free cash flow, and we've returned $15 billion in dividends and share repurchases, including more than $4 billion last year. As you saw with the dividend increase and a new repurchase authorization that we announced today, returning substantial capital to our shareholders remains a cornerstone of our capital plan.", "So we accomplished a lot in 2012. I think we're exiting the year stronger than we ended it. And with another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth under our belt, I think it's fair to say that our approach is working. Our track record shows that a combination of good organic growth, tight cost controls and active balance sheet management can consistently deliver attractive financial performance and strong equity returns.", "With that, I'll turn it over to John. Thanks for listening.", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. Starting with the consolidated highlights of the first slide, you'll see that the fourth quarter was a terrific way to end what was another really strong year. The fourth quarter was our strongest quarter of the year in terms of growth, coming in even a little better than we anticipated, with adjusted operating income up 16% and adjusted EPS up almost 25%. And that helped us post another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, up 13%.", "As Jeff mentioned, the initiatives we put in place several years ago have allowed us to achieve consistently strong results. In fact, 2012 was our fourth straight year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and that was despite a slight dip in revenue which resulted from very difficult comparisons at the Film and TV Entertainment group, as well as a very challenging environment in Publishing.", "We were able to accomplish that due to a continued positive mix shift toward higher margin networks and TV production businesses, a continuing big focus on costs across the company and our ongoing share repurchase program.", "We reduced operating expenses by low-single digits in 2012, enabling us to push up margins by over 100 basis points for the full year. That included holding network costs almost flat even as we made significant investments in original programming at both Turner and HBO. As you know, that's been a consistent theme at the company now for a long time. On a consolidated basis, we've kept our expenses essentially flat over the past 4 years, increasing margins by more than 500 basis points over that period.", "For the full year 2012, we also deployed about $1 billion in dividends and over $3 billion in share repurchases. And as evidenced by the dividend increase and new repurchase authorization we announced this morning, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns. So we're very pleased with how the year ended, and we feel great about how we're positioned going into 2013 and beyond.", "Now let me turn to the segment highlights, beginning at the networks, where both HBO and Turner grew adjusted operating income double digits for both the quarter and the full year. That resulted in another record year of profits for this segment.", "Subscription revenues were up a very healthy 7% in the quarter and 6% for the year, and that's despite a modest negative impact from foreign currency. That growth reflects both higher domestic rates and continued international growth. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO is experiencing the strongest domestic subscriber trends it's seen in years. That includes improved performance across most of our major distributors, and we've seen particular strength from satellite and telco, which continue to take share from the cable operators. Keep in mind that due to the nature of our affiliate contracts, the majority of these subscriber additions are non revenue-generating, still with sub growth provided some boost in 2012 and gives us a good start heading into the year.", "So we feel good about the trajectory of subscription revenues here, and that's before we see the expected benefits from our upcoming domestic renewal cycle at Turner, which will begin to kick in, in 2014.", "Moving over to advertising, revenues were up 3% in the quarter, with domestic advertising revenue up 7%. And that was helped by additional NBA games compared to the year-ago quarter, which was impacted by the NBA work stoppage. We also had a very good quarter at CNN, which benefited from higher ratings around the U.S. presidential election. International advertising revenues declined just under 10% in the quarter. Growth was negatively impacted by the shutdown of Imagine and TNT Turkey, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange movements.", "Looking through these items, international ad revenue would have been about flat in the quarter, and that's clearly below what our longer term expectations are here, and that's due to the tough economic conditions that currently exist in Europe, as well as some current rating softness in Latin America.", "Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013, we anticipate total reported advertising revenues to be about flat. And that's a little slower than the fourth quarter, and that's due to a few reasons. First, we're not going to benefit from additional NBA games; or second, the 2012 U.S. presidential election as we did in the fourth quarter; and third, we'll have fewer NCAA games versus the year-ago period, and that's due to timing of the tournament.", "However, we expect the pace of advertising growth to pick up starting in the second quarter as we lap the transfer of management of SI.com and Golf.com to Time Inc. and the international network shutdowns that I previously mentioned. Our year-over-year comparisons also ease somewhat as the year progresses. So for the full year 2013, we still anticipate solid growth in networks advertising.", "Adjusted operating income at the networks group was up a very strong 17% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year, with margins expanding almost 200 basis points for the year. In addition to solid revenue growth, that reflects continued tight cost controls, which was evident throughout the year. For 2012, programming expenses were up just 2%, and overall expenses were up only 1%. And that's despite a high-single-digit increase in original entertainment and sports programming.", "Expenses and margins benefited from international network shutdowns. But even without those, 2012's results were the continuation of a multi-year trend in margin expansion. Networks margins are up over 600 basis points since 2008 and over 1,000 basis points over the past decade. And we expect those trends to continue over the next several years.", "At our international networks businesses, including HBO's unconsolidated ventures, profits were relatively flat in 2012 at around $650 million. And that was largely due to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates; the macroeconomic conditions in some territories, especially Europe; and HBO's expansion into new regions. But we're confident in the longer-term growth trajectory here, and we continue to expect these businesses to reach about $1 billion in adjusted operating income in the next few years.", "For 2013, we expect to have another great year at the networks segment. As I just mentioned, we feel good about subscription and advertising revenue trends. And on the cost side, we remain very focused on investing in programming while limiting growth in non-revenue-generating expenses. And internationally, we anticipate a return to very strong profit growth this year as a result of improving organic revenue trends, a reduced drag from FX and recently announced cost savings initiatives in Europe.", "So putting that all together, we expect another year of margin expansion, an attractive growth in adjusted operating income at this segment.", "Let me turn now over to Film and TV, where Warner Bros. posted its highest quarterly adjusted operating income ever in the fourth quarter of 2012. And from what we can tell, it's actually the highest quarterly profit any studio has ever generated in any particular quarter. And for the year, Warner Bros. had its second-highest profits ever.", "For the quarter and the year, margins benefited from both a mixed shift towards higher margin TV revenue and a decline in P&A spending due to fewer theatrical releases. To put the year in context, if you set aside 2011 for a moment, adjusted operating income was more than 10% higher than in any other year in its history. And of course, we did that without a Harry Potter theatrical or Harry Potter home video release. Warner's ability to maintain such a high level of profitability is a testament to the diversity of revenue streams here and in particular, to the strong performance of the TV production business.", "In 2012, Warner Bros. TV accounted for approximately 60% of Warner Bros.' profits and it grew both revenues and profits year-over-year despite an extremely challenging comparison against the syndication of The Big Bang Theory and Friends in 2011. It was able to overcome those comparisons partially due to growth in demand from SVOD services and international syndication. For the year, we've recognized around $350 million in SVOD revenues, the majority of which came from our television product.", "In our theatrical business, we had a very good year and a very successful fourth quarter despite difficult comparisons. The first film in The Hobbit trilogy has generated around $950 million at the global box office and is on track to join The Dark Knight Rises as our second 2012 release to pass $1 billion in global box office. The strong box office performances of The Hobbit and the critically acclaimed film Argo helped keep our theatrical revenues almost flat in the fourth quarter, and that's despite a decline in the number of theatrical releases.", "Looking ahead to 2013, we are very optimistic about the film slate, which, as Jeff mentioned, includes the second film in the Hobbit trilogy, Man of Steel and Hangover 3, to name just a few.", "Additionally, we have another strong year at our TV studio, where we continue to see robust demand across major buyers, including domestic and international SVOD services. In addition to some recent SVOD deals, we remain in active discussions with all major SVOD services about additional content packages. The strong demand for both our TV and theatrical product is showing up in our backlog, which reached a record $6 billion at the end of 2012, and that's up 60% over the past 5 years. Backlog, as a reminder, is cash licensing revenue for television and theatrical product that will be recognized in the future. So that gives us a lot of confidence about the long-term growth prospects in this business.", "We're also encouraged by recent signs of stabilization in home entertainment, with total consumer spending for the industry actually flat in 2012. That's happening because digital is now big enough and growing fast enough to make up for physical declines. In fact, Warner's digital home video revenue, including SVOD, VOD and EST, approached $1 billion in 2012, and we expect it to grow close to 20% in 2013.", "And we also have a strong games release this year, which will include the next release in the Batman Arkham franchise. So all in all, we expect Warners to post another very strong year in 2013. And with a little luck, the year should be as good or maybe even a little bit better than 2012.", "Let's move on to Publishing, where very challenging industry conditions weighed on Time Inc.'s results for both the quarter and the year. Nevertheless, Time Inc. continued to take advertising shares during 2012, and fourth quarter trends showed some signs of improvement across both advertising and subscription revenues.", "Advertising revenues declined 4% in the quarter. And while clearly not where we want that to be, that marked the smallest advertising decline of the year.", "Subscription revenues were flat in the quarter, an improvement over the last couple of quarters, and that included both better underlying trends, as well as the impact of having an additional week in the calendar. Newsstand sales remained somewhat soft in the fourth quarter, but People Magazine took significant share in its category.", "It's worth pointing out that other revenues were negatively impacted by the absence of revenues from QSP, which was sold in the first quarter of 2012. The absence of QSP was also the principal driver of the drop in adjusted operating income at Time Inc. during the quarter. While QSP was roughly breakeven for full year 2011, it was a highly seasonal business, only generating profits in the fourth quarter. So excluding any impact of its sale, adjusted operating income would have effectively been flat at Time Inc. in the quarter.", "As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2013, advertising newsstand sales remains somewhat soft, but we continue to see some improvement in underlying trends relative to recent quarters. In light of the ongoing industry challenges, Time Inc. has started the process of reducing its global workforce by approximately 6%. This restructuring will lower costs in both our domestic and international operations by centralizing certain functions, increasing collaboration across titles and streamlining research and marketing. These actions will result in a restructuring charge of around $60 million, which we plan to take in the first quarter.", "Turning to the next slide, let me provide some context for our 2013 outlook. As I noted before, we were able to generate really nice growth in adjusted operating income and strong growth in adjusted EPS in 2012 even without growing revenue. That reflects our continued ability to keep tight control over costs and also highlights the positive impact of our ongoing share repurchase program.", "As we look at 2013, we see continued strong profit growth at Networks, another strong year at Film and TV Entertainment and some stabilization in Publishing declines. So we expect faster growth in adjusted operating income in 2013 versus 2012.", "At the same time, the share count impact will be less favorable than it was in 2012, and that's because our aggressive pace of share repurchases in 2011 benefited the 2012 share count and because the rise in our stock since the summer pushed all employee stock options into the money. All of that's reflected in our outlook for low double-digit growth and adjusted EPS. Keep in mind that our outlook includes the roughly $60 million restructuring that I just mentioned at Publishing. In addition, this year, we expect to incur about an incremental $25 million of spending year-over-year on our enterprise efficiency initiatives. It's also likely that we're going to begin to account for our nearly 50% stake at CME as an equity investment later this year, upon the expiration of our voting agreement.  Assuming the same level of losses as we recognized last year, that would result in us recognizing about a $30 million amount of additional equity losses in 2013.", "Looking beyond 2013, I also want to talk about why we feel so confident and why we feel we're so well positioned for the next few years. Around 85% of our profits are tied to the TV ecosystem, which is extremely healthy, both here and around the world. And that's by all measures: subscribers, viewership, affiliate fees and advertising.", "Another 10% of our profits come from movies, which are benefiting from positive trends in global box office and recent signs of a stabilization at home video. And as Jeff described, our major strategic initiatives are geared to take advantage of these trends. We think we'll continue to see the payoff from those initiatives in the next several years as we leverage our content investment by increasing our affiliate fees, drive international growth in our networks, continue to monetize our content on new platforms and start to see the benefits from our enterprise efficiency initiatives. When we put all that together and we add in continued returns to shareholders, we think we can continue to generate very attractive growth for the foreseeable future.", "Turning to the next slide, which looks at our free cash flow. In 2012, we generated almost $3 billion, and that was higher than we anticipated coming into the year. And that was the result of very strong free cash flow generation in the back half of the year. Free cash flow was up nicely over 2011 as we grew adjusted operating income while reducing our investments in working capital and reducing capital expenditures. The decline in working capital was largely a result of having fewer event films in production, as well as a higher reimbursement for co-financed productions. CapEx was also lower, and that was partially due to the completion of the making of Harry Potter at our studio in Leavesden.", "Those positive factors were somewhat offset by an increase in cash taxes and cash interest in 2012, but we still saw an increase in our conversion of both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted net income. As a reminder, over the past few years, we had some significant working capital needs due to principally the timing and nature of film production at our studio. We've begun to see that reverse during the back half of 2012, and we should continue to see the benefits of those investments over the next several years. So as a result of that, we believe our rate of free cash flow conversion should move higher over the next several years.", "Let me move now to the final slide, which looks at our net debt. We ended 2012 with a strong and flexible balance sheet. Net debt was $17 billion at the end of the year, and our leverage ratio was 2.4x, which is just below our target of 2.5x.", "During the year, we took advantage of market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet and maintained strategic flexibility by issuing $1 billion of new public long-term debt and extending the maturity date on $2.5 billion of our $5 billion credit facility, all at highly attractive rates.", "In addition to investing in our businesses, we deployed just under $700 million in strategic M&A transactions, including the acquisition of Bleacher Report, as well as increasing our investment in CME. Also, as I previously mentioned, we returned over $4 billion of capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases. So if you look back over the past 4 years, our approach has been one of balance and consistency.", "Since 2008, we have generated over $11 billion in free cash flow, and we've paid out close to $4 billion in dividends. We've repurchased over $11 billion of our shares, or 27% of the base, and we've spent a little under $3 billion on acquisitions.", "In 2013, our philosophy of capital deployment will not change. We'll continue to aim for the appropriate balance between maintaining a strong balance sheet, providing us access to the capital markets and strategic flexibility, as well as actively deploying our capital. And we still think that a targeted leverage ratio of 2.5x is the best level that balances all of these goals. This will enable us to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and return a substantial amount of capital to stockholders.", "So I appreciate you listening today. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Doug, and we'll start the Q&A portion. Thank you.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks a lot, John. Ellen, can we get the Q&A started? [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Janedis with UBS.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Jeff, over the past couple of months, you've announced a handful of exclusive SVOD deals. I think some of them will ultimately include current network shows, which I think is new for you. Can you talk about your ability to grow that exclusive window going forward based on existing rights? And then John, on a related topic, you gave us a $350 million of SVOD for last year. Based on what you have on the books, can you give us an update for this year?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, John. The -- I think you were asking about the slate deal with Netflix. Is that right?", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. It's not really a change in the syndication business. It's very similar to the CW deal we already had in place. We've been saying for a while that subscription VOD is the right place for serialized and library product. That's also true, by the way, of all the originals on HBO, which is serialized VOD. And on the normal syndication market, serialized series did not have that much value. So we think it's an increase to essentially the financial ecosystem of -- at least the serialized and library part of TV shows. And at the same time, we're seeing positive impact on ratings of new seasons on serialized shows from having the older seasons available on a VOD basis. And so those recent deals with broadcast networks enable us to syndicate serialized seasons -- it's basically, we put those series 1 season back, and it's not really a big change. I'm glad you asked about it because I think, as John pointed out on the call, we generated over $350 million in revenue from SVOD deals in 2012. That doesn't even include the CW deal, which is similar in that serialized \"1 season back\" way. And that's pretty significant. And since we've already signed some new deals in 2013 with both Amazon and Netflix, and there's some more being discussed, we feel very good about the trajectory of the business from a financial support point of view. And we think it's fitting in to the network ecosystem very well.", "John K. Martin", "Hey, John, in terms the question that you asked about what percentage was essentially already on the books for 2013, the short answer is it's a little bit more than 1/2.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Two questions, Jeff, about some recent decisions you guys have made. One, can you talk about the elevation of Kevin to CEO at Warner Bros, what that might mean to the strategy and the cost structure at Warner's? And any expectation around what Bruce and Jeff may do, since obviously they play a huge role at the company? And then #2, at HBO, some people I think thought you might let one of the studios exit over time and redeploy that capital into original programming. Can you just talk about the decision to continue to pay for a film output on HBO, given sort of the macro trends we're seeing in that business?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, fine. Thanks. Warner's first. Kevin is going to be a great leader at Warner's. We -- well, I chose him because he's got the greatest breadth of experience across Warner's businesses. I think he's going to do a very good job of bringing together the television group, which is the leading TV production group in the world; the theatrical group, which is also the leading group in the world on a consistency basis; our digital and home video business, which has always been the #1 share leader; and consumer products, which is not #1, that's Disney, but we have high expectations for that going forward. Very thoughtful -- Kevin's very thoughtful about the future of the studio business and the integration of all those businesses that we have. Having said that, we have a very strong group of execs at Warner's, notably Bruce Rosenblum, running the TV group, which is extremely successful and on a big roll right now; and Jeff Robinov running the theatrical group, also very -- much more consistently successful than the other film studios. And operating -- we only had a bigger scale. So I think with those 3 working together going forward, we've got a very good lineup. I think all of those execs, including Jeff and Bruce, have very strong benches of people beneath them as well. So we're basically moving toward -- and Barry Meyer deserves a lot of credit for creating this situation. We've got really a strong next generation coming at Warner's, and all of them are young enough to go pretty long. So one of the hallmarks of Warner's has been consistency of the management over time and a deep bench. And I'm very optimistic about how that's going to go. On your HBO question, yes, we talked about and seriously consider what was the optimal thing for HBO to do in terms of how much movie commitments. As you know, we have had the leading movie lineup at -- with Warner's first and then Fox and Universal joining. We decided to continue that out for the next decade. It gives us some very high quality programming to fill many plex feeds in a very robust VOD offering at both HBO and Cinemax, and it is true that the original programming continues to grow in profile and in volume and in quality at HBO. But still, only about 40% of the HBO subs still primarily watch movies, and about 80% of the viewing on our linear plex feeds are movies. So they still have a tremendous value. They're very important for Cinemax as distinctive offerings. Cinemax may be the world's best movie service. And I think if you look over at some of our competitors, take the move of movie -- Disney movies on to Netflix, which shows that there's some value there for movies in the VOD world. So we basically made the decision to have 1/2 the -- the exclusive rights to 1/2 of Hollywood movie outputs, a very advantageous thing for HBO over the next decade. And from a financial point of view, these deals don't come into -- there's no financial effect of these renewals for the next 3 or 4 -- 3 years or so. And then when the new deals kick over in '16, '17, they basically are aligned with box office growth. And what that means is that it's a very good financial ramp for HBO over the long run, and it provides continuously more room for original programming. And as you know, when you have hit original programming series on HBO, they not only fuel the subscription service, they are fueling the subscription growth we mentioned in the global part of HBO, which is now over $70 million, and then they fuel the content revenue. And for -- on that score, I think Game of Thrones is maybe the leading DVD seller in the world right now for TV series. So it's extremely -- it's a very good architecture at the present time at HBO.", "Operator", "We have Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Could you give us an update on how you view Netflix's move into original programming? While they're obviously a nice customer of yours, 5-year content, can they also be viewed -- or do you view them also as a competitor, particularly to HBO? And any influence you think it might have on HBO going forward?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, thank you. Let's start with HBO first, since they -- HBO is", "[Audio Gap]", "I feel great about how HBO is doing today. I think we just talked about it. It's got the best original programming slate ever, a lot of very high-profile series and more every year. We've locked up the theatrical movie position for the next decade. The HBO GO product is a fantastic, 21st-century, Internet-ready product, and we just added more subs than at any time in the last 10 years. Now let's go over and give a little credit to Netflix. They're doing a great job. I think the functionality of their service, some of the really consumer-friendly effectiveness of their search, if you're watching it, finding what you want to watch, getting recommendations to go through a very, very deep library, a lot of programming, it's -- the more programs you have on a service, the more important it is to be able to find them. But if you talk about original programming, HBO has always operated in a competitive environment. We've been happy to see some of the successes at Showtime and Stars recently in originals. Netflix has a new original that's pretty good, House of Cards. I think that's great. It'll take a while for that to turn into -- I forget, what does HBO get? 10 or so hits here? It's all good. I think it reminds consumers of the choice that they have of television programming on demand. And it's an extremely -- the cycle of making breakthrough original programming and having people find it and use it, which HBO has been doing for 20 years, and Netflix is now joining, it takes a while to get back up to scale.", "Operator", "We have Tim Nollen with Macquarie.", "Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research", "I wanted to follow up on TV Everywhere, please. What can you do to help galvanize the industry to promote the service better, get more content on and also to promote VOD? Because it seems like you are really -- you have been leading the effort here, and you mentioned it's been a slow start. But I would just like to know what you can do to get your peers both on the distributor, as well as the content owner sides to go further with that. Can I also ask a question on ratings, please? You spoke last time, I think, about doing some things to try to improve the rating systems, whether it's moving from C3 to C7, whether it's including VOD or TV Everywhere, whether it's to include tablets. Just updated thoughts on what might be underway there.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. Let me -- good, let's start with TV Everywhere. Basically, that structure of having streaming and VOD available is embraced by basically every program network, every distributor. Even broadcasters are now embracing TVE. For example, NBC had great success with its Olympics coverage, and Disney had a very positive response to its apps for sports. And Fox is authenticating prime time content on hulu.com and fox.com. I think Scripps and Viacom have also made recent TVE announcements. And as you said, Turner, Time Warner, HBO, all of our networks were the first to put most of our shows on a VOD -- television everywhere basis. I think the technology is evolving. Adobe Pass is now an authentication solution. It's in use by most major programmers. It was developed by Turner and Adobe together, and it enables consumers to authenticate just once across unaffiliated networks. So it makes it much easier for a consumer to get keyed up and not have to do it every time they turn on their device or they try to switch channels. Other enhancements like modem-based authentication are also streamlining the authentication process. We totally agree. I view [ph] with your -- the premise of your question, which is it's really important for the distributor world to make it easier, faster, not complicated or daunting, for people to use this fantastic set of rights. So one of the things -- I think HBO GO, which is so powerful and easy to use, is showing everyone exactly how much of a rainbow -- on how much of a pot of gold is at the end of the rainbow. So hopefully that'll stimulate more action. We think there are some very important device companies, Apple may be one of them, who are working to try to create better interfaces with devices people love to access their TV Everywhere content. Of course, that makes your network more valuable if you have it on a device and in an interface that you like. On ratings, we agree generally that probably -- the same point really, to get consumers a stronger connection to their favorite network viewing. It makes more sense for people to work on a weekly basis, not a 3-day basis. So we think C3 should expand to C7. Look, if the rights go there at the office, the measurement will follow. And that's probably how it will happen.", "Operator", "We have Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Jeff, you emphasized a greater level of originals at TBS and TNT. I think you said 40-plus percent more this year, and I know it's been an ongoing strategy. This puts acquired syndicated product as a lesser and lesser part of the mix while you, I guess, look at viewership or dollars spent or however you want to look at it. Is there any update you can give us regarding the effectiveness of acquired syndicated products and any implications for the studio or the cable network business to the extent that syndicated content doesn't provide the same value that it used to for networks like TNT and TBS?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, it's kind of -- if you're asking whether secularly acquired product is questionable, no, because you've got to look at which kind and which type. If you took the Big Bang Theory, for example, moving on to TBS this year, it's the biggest show in any Cable network anywhere. It took the ratings up 30% to 40%. It's hugely successful. If you then look at the kind of original programming series that come into networks like TNT, USA, et cetera, you have to look at where -- the era which they come from. And as we've talked about before, 3, 4 or 5 years ago, the broadcast networks had a slump in scripted drama and some original series. And so it's important not to generalize from that slump. We've had some come on and work really well. Castle is on TNT, it's a drama. It's working better than we thought. We had The Mentalist come on to TNT. It was the #1 show back when we brought it on, and it has fallen off a bit at CBS in terms of new shows next week, and the same at TNT. So you do have a mixed bag. What we think is that since we at TNT, TBS have essentially a sister company access to the production company that makes the best shows across television, Warner Bros. TV has shows more than 2 at every 1 of the 5 networks, we think that we are in a good position to be able to pick the ones that fit our networks and to put them into an economic system as we dial up and down the mix of acquired series that are hits. You should look at them as hits, not reruns. They're not reruns for the people who watch them. And then if you pick the right diet of increasing, in our case, original series, and you mix that with the right sports offering, you have a very powerful network to launch things. It's kind of the new version of what the broadcast networks were 30 years ago.", "Operator", "We have David Miller with B. Riley Caris.", "David W. Miller - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Can you talk about -- Jeff, can you talk about what the scatter-over-scatter performance was at TNT, excluding the NBA and also including the NBA? I'd just be interested in the delta between those 2 numbers. And then, Jeff, can you talk about whether or not your bias would be to renew the output deal with Legendary over here in southern -- in Los Angeles? Obviously, they're just a huge supplier of premium content for you guys. I think they're doing Man of Steel. I think they're shouldering most of that cost burden, correct me if I'm wrong. Hangover 3 is in there, Pacific Rim is in there. There have been some rumors over here in Los Angeles about some contentiousness in the negotiations. Could you comment in any way?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, let me start with Legendary. The deal with Thomas Tull's Legendary goes to the end of the year. We're all very close to Thomas. We've got a great relationship. No, there's not contentiousness. There is problem solving going on, and we expect to have very meaningful discussions with Legendary about the extension and the term -- on the basis basically on which it would make sense for Legendary and for us. We're confident in our ability to generate a robust slate of films regardless of our financial partners, and we have very high regard for Legendary. So don't worry about that on either our account or theirs.", "John K. Martin", "Hey, David, it's John. One always wonders if somebody is going to ask a question that you haven't thought of, and I think you would get the award for this call. I don't know because we don't really look at scatter-over-scatter in terms of the way we run the business in general. So looking backward, with and without the NBA, you'd probably need to follow up with Doug and team afterwards. I will tell you, in Q1, at the risk of repeating what we already said, scatter is pretty steady with pricing up, which probably means current quarter scatter-over-scatter is up a little bit. But we'll have to get back to you in terms of looking backward.", "Operator", "The last question comes from Michael Morris with Davenport & Company.", "Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. First, on sports rights, Jeff, you mentioned that you have the second-largest collection of national sports rights after ESPN. So my question is, would you consider establishing a standalone sports network? You look at ESPN doing over $5 per sub per month. Is that something you would contemplate? Why or why not? And then second, internationally, you mentioned streamlining Western Europe. Does that mean that you would not look to expand your channel's holdings in Western Europe through acquisition? Or is that still a possibility?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. Let me start with sports rights. Sports rights, particularly the ones we've been renewing lately, the NCAA championships, the baseball deal, we're very happy with the performance in terms of ratings, and they're a very important part of the value of our channels as we go through affiliate renewals. So they're an important part of the offer, but we're focused on having the right sports. We'll continue to evaluate potential opportunities in the future, but we will do that basically in the framework of our current existing networks, not as a startup of standalone sports networks. If you go to Europe -- I'll start. What we meant by streamlining Western Europe is we don't have as much scale in essentially locally based networks there or, to some extent, in distribution of our worldwide networks as we do in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. And so we were streamlining the staff layers there. We don't have a big -- we don't have -- we're not interested in going out trying to rig a big acquisition in Western Europe, if that's what you're asking. John, you want to add anything?", "John K. Martin", "Nope.", "Douglas Shapiro", "All right. Well, we're upon the hour, so thanks, everybody, for listening.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Time Warner. Mr. Shapiro, you may begin.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, 1 detailing our results for the second quarter and the other raising our 2013 business outlook.", "Before we begin, there are a few things I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our site. Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and the subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "And lastly, in the second quarter, we began accounting for investment in Central European Media Enterprises as an equity investment. Due to the accounting rules, we have recast our historical financials as though we had accounted for it as an equity investment since we first invested in CME in May 2009. Because CME has historically produced net losses, this accounting change reduced full year 2012 adjusted EPS by $0.04 and our first quarter 2013 adjusted EPS by $0.06. In the second quarter, the impact was a $0.02 reduction.", "Thank you, and let me turn the call over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Doug. This was another really successful quarter for us, financially and operationally. It puts us in great position to post another year of strong growth in 2013 and beyond. In the second quarter, we grew revenue of 10%, we grew adjusted operating income 25% and we increased adjusted earnings per share almost 50%. During the first half of the year, we also generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow. That's triple the amount we generated in the first half of last year. And over the last few months, we bought back almost another $1 billion worth of our stock.", "This morning, we also increased our guidance for adjusted EPS growth this year. That's a reflection of our performance in the first half and our confidence about how we're positioned for the rest of the year. John will discuss our financial results and outlook in detail in a few minutes.", "I'd like to point out some of our key operational highlights this quarter, starting with the networks. At Turner, we saw a continuing evidence of the growing value of our brands and programming to our viewers, our advertisers and our affiliates. TNT and TBS finished the quarter as the #1 and the #3 networks in prime time for adults 18 to 49 on all of cable. At TNT, the story again was sports and originals. The NBA playoffs on TNT were the third most viewed in the 29-year history of the NBA on Turner, outdelivering all networks, broadcast and cable, among adults 18 to 49 during May sweeps.", "And Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals was the highest-rating NBA game on TNT ever. As you know, we're steadily increasing the amount of original programming on TNT and we're airing originals year round. We had about double the number of original hours in prime time this quarter compared to last year and it's paying off, led by shows like Falling Skies, Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes and Dallas. Ratings on our prime time originals during the quarter more than doubled compared to the same period last year.", "At TBS, The Big Bang Theory was again the #1 sitcom on cable and Cougar Town was the #1 original sitcom on cable. In fact, our original programming on TBS was up over 50% compared to our originals in the second quarter last year. As you know, we've recently made a number of changes at CNN and we're seeing real progress. This quarter, CNN was up almost 70% in its key demo during total day, while both of its cable news competitors were down. In fact, CNN surpassed MSNBC to finish as the #2 network of the quarter in both total viewers and adults 25 to 54 for the first time in almost 4 years. That was partially driven by a high volume of breaking news events, but we saw strength across almost every daypart and every show, even away from breaking news coverage. For instance, in June, CNN's new morning show, New Day, was up over 50% in the key demo over last year and Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown is an unqualified hit. Our brands and programming are resonating with our advertisers, too. We just completed negotiations for the 2013 to '14 upfront and our portfolio of entertainment-oriented networks, TBS, TNT, truTV and Adult Swim, obtained CPM increases in the high single-digits. Once again, that was at the high-end of the range for all TV networks, broadcast and cable.", "Our affiliates also recognize the value of our networks. As you may recall, last year at this time, we first told you that we expect Turner's domestic subscription revenue to grow at double-digit CAGR between 2013 and 2016. Last month, we completed a contract renewal with a top 5 distributor and got the affiliate fee increases we were seeking. This gives us even more confidence that we'll achieve our long-range targets.", "At HBO, our programming lineup is as strong as it's ever been, which is saying a lot. Game of Thrones finished its third season with an average of 14 million viewers per episode. That's up more than 20% from last year and firmly establishes it as the second most popular series ever on HBO. True Blood recently launched its sixth season and is averaging over 10 million viewers per episode. And in its second season, The Newsroom is averaging 7 million to 8 million viewers. Last, but not least, our made-for-HBO movie, Behind the Candelabra, starring Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, was the most-watched HBO film in 10 years. And HBO received 108 Primetime Emmy nominations this year. That's the most of any network for the 13th consecutive year and it's more than double the nearest competitor. It's also the most that HBO has received in 9 years. That included nominations for Outstanding Drama Series for Game of Thrones, Outstanding Comedy Series for both Girls and VEEP and Outstanding Miniseries Or Movie for Behind the Candelabra and for Phil Spector. We intend to build on this success.", "HBO remains the port of first call for distinctive-airing television. And right now, we have more pilots in development at HBO than in any time in its history, including projects for Mike Judge, Damon Lindelof, David Milch and Ryan Murphy, among others.", "We also had a fantastic quarter at Warner Bros. Warner Bros. TV wrapped up one of its most successful upfront seasons ever. It received orders for 31 shows on the 5 broadcast networks for next season, including 18 that are returning shows and 13 new shows. That's the highest number of total orders in years and it's the most returning shows in over 30 years. Importantly, we have orders for 10 comedies, which as you know, have the greatest potential value in syndication.", "We also had a really strong theatrical quarter, led by the performance of Man of Steel and The Great Gatsby. Notably, Man of Steel, our Superman reboot, is on track to generate almost $700 million at the worldwide box office. That's obviously a great start to the franchise. A few weeks ago, we revealed exciting plans for a Man of Steel sequel that will bring together Superman and Batman, which is scheduled for 2015. We have a lot more plans for DC that we look forward to sharing when the time is right.", "Looking out into the third quarter and through the rest of this year. The Conjuring is well exceeding our forecast. It's on track to reach $130 million at the box office domestically, putting it among the top 5 horror films of all time. We're optimistic that We're The Millers, starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis and opening tonight, has the makings of a sleeper hit. And we're particularly excited about our biggest remaining release of the year, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.", "I want to touch on some significant personnel changes we announced recently. After leading Turner Broadcasting to great success for over a decade, Phil Kent recently approached me with a decision not to renew his contract after it expires next year. I'm very excited that John Martin has agreed to take on the CEO role at Turner, starting January 1. We'll miss John's leadership here at corporate, but he'll been in an even better position to drive Time Warner's success from that seat. Howard Averill, current CFO of Time Inc., will move over to Time Warner to replace John. Howard has been a steady hand during a period of tremendous change at Time Inc. and I'm confident he'll prove a great addition to the senior management team at Time Warner. We also announced that Joe Ripp, a veteran of Time Warner and an accomplished media executive, will return to lead Time Inc. as CEO. Having someone of Joe's caliber in place is a key component of our plan to spin off Time Inc. into an independent, publicly traded company.", "I'll also update you on the timing of the Time Inc. spend. Our top priority in the spinoff is to make sure that we put Time Inc. in the best possible position to succeed. So rather than rush to complete the transaction this year, we've decided that it's prudent to give Joe some time to further refine Time Inc.'s strategic direction and as a result, we now expect to complete the spinoff early next year.", "So in closing, with more than half the year behind us, we're very proud of what we've achieved. We're also very confident of how we're positioned, both for 2013 and the years to come.", "With that, I'll pass it to John.", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website, and starting with our consolidated results. We're halfway through the year and we couldn't be more pleased with our performance to date. We've delivered strong results in the first quarter and even stronger results this quarter. In fact, through the first half of the year, our adjusted operating income is up 15% and we've grown adjusted earnings per share by almost 30% year-over-year. That's a result of healthy underlying trends across nearly all of our businesses.", "In the second quarter, our revenues grew 10% and that included a nearly 200 basis-point drag from our Publishing division. We had a terrific quarter at Networks, which posted its highest quarterly revenues and profits ever. And company-wide, international revenues grew almost 20% in the quarter.", "Adjusted operating income grew 25%, making it our highest second quarter ever for profits. Margins expanded over 230 basis points and that included margin expansion at each of our reporting segments. And that's despite double-digit growth in programming, production and marketing expenses, which we were able to offset partially by reducing other cost of revenues and other SG&A expenses. And this discipline has allowed us to produce very strong financial results even while we're investing aggressively for the future.", "Continuing to move down to P&L. Adjusted EPS grew even faster than adjusted operating income, climbing 46%. And that's the 12th time in the last 15 quarters that adjusted EPS has grown double digits, along with our strong operating performance that was helped by a lower effective tax rate and our ongoing allocation of capital to share repurchases.", "Since we last reported earnings, we've repurchased almost $1 billion of common stock, which is an acceleration from the first quarter, and we also paid over $270 million in dividends. So year-to-date, we returned almost $2.4 billion to shareholders, including more than $1.8 billion in share repurchases and $500 million in dividends. And as Jeff mentioned, in light of this strong performance and our confidence of our ability to execute in the back half of the year, we're raising our 2013 full year business outlook for adjusted EPS and we now expect growth to be in the mid-teens year-over-year.", "Let me now turn to the specific segment highlights and let me begin at our Networks segment where each of HBO and Turner grew adjusted operating income double-digits. Advertising revenues were up 11% year-over-year and that's our highest quarterly growth rate in 2 years. And please recall that we benefited from the timing of the Final Four this quarter. But if you look through that, domestic ad growth was also around 11%. And that includes solid growth across all of our categories. That's domestic entertainment, that's kids and that's news.", "International advertising declined in the low single-digits, but without the prior year closure of TNT Turkey and the impact of foreign currency movements, it would have been up mid single-digits. And that was a result of mid-teens growth at international entertainment, which was partially offset by declines at international news.", "Looking ahead to the third quarter, we continue to see very solid trends here with scatter pricing up double digits over the upfront. So as of now, we anticipate mid to high single-digit growth in total Networks advertising in Q3.", "Moving on. Subscription revenue growth was 4% in the quarter, which was relatively consistent with the mid single-digit growth that we saw in the first quarter. This quarter, the mix of subscribers at HBO and a stronger U.S. dollar both somewhat weighed on Subscription revenue growth. And as we look ahead to the rest of the year, we continue to believe that Subscription revenue growth will be up mid single-digits. And as Jeff mentioned, with Turner recently securing a new deal with a top 5 distributor, we have even more confidence that we'll see significant acceleration in Subscription revenues beginning in 2014.", "Adjusted operating income at the Networks segment was up a very strong 13% in the quarter, with margins increasing almost 180 basis points year-over-year. And please note that growth this quarter did benefit from an adjustment through a receivable allowance, but even without that, adjusted operating income would still have been up double digits. And that reflects both of the revenue growth as well as our ongoing focus on constricting non-programming costs, as programming expenses increased 8% in the quarter. So in the first half, programming expenses at the Networks were up 4%, which is consistent with our expectation of, in any given year, programming expenses being up mid to high single-digits.", "Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate margins are going to be up here at this group for the year. And that's despite continued growth in our programming investments. So 2013 should be another very, very strong year for the Networks segment. And we're positioning ourselves to grow at attractive levels for the foreseeable future here.", "So now let me turn to our Film and TV production group at Warner's, which had another really terrific quarter with revenues up 13% and adjusted operating income up 34%. The increase in adjusted operating income was largely driven by the strong performance of our Film slate. And that included films such as Man of Steel, The Great Gatsby and The Hangover Part III. In Television, we faced a very difficult comparison against the domestic syndication sale of The Mentalist in the year-ago quarter. And despite this difficult comparison, the underlying trends remain really strong here. In addition to the really successful upfront season that Jeff described, we also saw higher international license fees and very healthy demand for our television product from SVOD services, both domestic and international. We recognize just under $70 million in SVOD revenue at Warner's in the second quarter and that's up significantly from a year ago.", "And if you look at Time Warner, we've recognized now year-to-date about $150 million of SVOD revenues. And we continue to expect that SVOD distribution channel will be a strong contributor to our results this year. Across theatrical and TV, Warner's Home Entertainment revenue was up 3% in the quarter. And while the industry was down slightly in the quarter, it grew modestly for the first half of 2013. And we're particularly encouraged by the growth in the electronics sell-through area, which was up over 50% for the industry in the first half. And while there's still work to do on improving the consumer experience here, we think it's a very positive sign for the future of the Home Entertainment business.", "Looking ahead, we expect second half results to be strongly weighted to the fourth quarter at Warner Bros. In the third quarter, we face very tough comparisons against last year's theatrical release of The Dark Knight Rises. In addition, we anticipate recognizing SVOD revenues from certain CW availabilities in the fourth quarter of this year versus recognizing them in the third quarter of 2012. And while we've already released the majority of our larger movies this year, we're optimistic about the rest of this year's theatrical release slate. And We're the Millers, which opens this evening, is a particularly funny film.", "Similarly, we feel very good about our position going into the new TV season due to Warner Bros.' industry-leading performance during this year's upfront. And we have very, very high hopes for the fourth quarter games release, including Batman: Arkham Origins. So we remain confident that Warner Bros. profits this year should be at least as good, if not better, than what they were last year. And we've been saying that now for some time.", "Let me move on to Publishing. At Time Inc., advertising revenues were down 5% in the quarter and that was due to declines both here as well as outside the U.S. Domestically, we saw softness at the sports and news groups. We also finally lapped the transfer of SI.com and Golf.com back to Time Inc., which contributed to advertising trends appearing somewhat worse than what they were in the first quarter. Subscription revenue fell 7% in the second quarter as we continue to see softness in newsstand sales. And looking to the back half of the year, we expect the decline in Subscription revenue to look somewhat similar to what we experienced in the first half of the year. But note, that we will see some shift of Subscription revenue to the third quarter from the fourth quarter due to the frequency of certain titles in each quarter. Despite lower revenues, adjusted operating income was up a pretty strong 28% in the quarter. And that was primarily a function of cost savings initiatives including the restructuring actions that were taken earlier this year.", "As we look to the rest of 2013, our comparisons as compared to last year become somewhat more challenging. So while we remain focused on cost controls at Time Inc., we don't expect that will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in the back half of this year.", "Now let me turn to the next slide, which looks at our full year 2013 business outlook. As I just said, we had a great first half of the year. And that's given us a tremendous amount of confidence to raise our full year 2013 outlook to mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS. And despite higher losses from our investment in CME than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the year, the absolute numbers implied by our new current guidance are nicely higher than our previous outlook. Clearly, our updated outlook implies that growth will slow somewhat in the back half of this year. And that's the result of difficult comparisons, particularly at our Film and TV and Publishing segments. And this is consistent with what we expected coming into this year and it certainly doesn't suggest any change to the health of the businesses. I'll also point out that our effective tax rate was a bit lower in the first half than we normally anticipate, as a result of settling a couple of audits with taxing authorities. And excluding those settlements, our effective tax rate would have been somewhere in the mid-30s, which is more in line with our longer-term expectations. So we feel good about raising guidance. We feel good about our performance. And we believe that we are set up for both a very good year and continued attractive growth in the longer term.", "Let me now turn to cash, free cash. We're having a big year for free cash flow generation. We've generated, through the first 6 months of the year, $1.8 billion of free cash flow. That's more than triple the year-ago period. And that's mostly due to an improvement in working capital, which we expected, and the strong growth of profits, which I've been just discussing. Capital expenditures and cash taxes are also lower year-to-date. The favorable working capital variance accounted for more than 1/2 of the improvement in free cash flow year-to-date. And the biggest drivers there were reimbursements for prior co-financings and the timing of payments for sports programming at Networks. The decline in cash taxes was primarily a result of tax law extenders that were passed by Congress in January this year. So with our solid performance through the first half of the year, we're on track for a really, really strong year of free cash flow generation in 2013.", "Turning now to the final slide which looks at our net debt. We ended the quarter with a little less than $17.4 billion in net debt. That's up about $350 million from year-end 2012. And that's largely due to the almost $2.1 billion of capital we allocated in the form of dividends and share repurchases in the first half. Providing stockholder returns remains a critical component of our capital plan. And as you can see, the amount of capital we've returned well exceeds the free cash flow we've generated year-to-date. That's consistent with how we've been allocating capital for a number of years now. And since 2008, we've generated about $13 billion in free cash flow. And over that same time period, we've repurchased almost $13 billion of stock or almost 30% of our float and, at the same time, we paid more than $4 billion in dividends. So our leverage ratio is now only 2.3x, which is a little bit below our target of 2.5x. And we still think that our target leverage ratio of 2.5x strikes the right balance of maintaining a balance sheet strength, while giving us the flexibility to invest in our core businesses, make acquisitions and return capital to our stockholders. So we'll continue to manage the balance sheet to stay close to that target over the course of the year.", "And with that, let me turn the call back to Doug so that we can begin the Q&A portion. Thank you.", "Douglas Shapiro", "Thanks, John. Dawn, let's get the Q&A started. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "My question is just on the affiliate renewals that are upcoming. The one you referenced to having signed last month, I believe, I assume that kicks in, in 2014 and not right away. And then just staying on that topic, the real positive move you've seen in ratings at CNN recently, is that -- do you expect -- I guess the timing of that is real good given your upcoming renewals or ongoing renewals. Do you expect as much sort of upside opportunity at CNN as you would at TNT in these renewals, given the addition of the NCAA?", "John K. Martin", "Alexia, it's John. I just -- with regard to the affiliate renewals, we're really not going to speak specifically. We have nondisclosure agreements with regard to the specific deals and -- but what was important and the reason why we felt like it was relevant to mention on the call is because going back to a year ago when we said we expected double-digit compound annual growth for the 3-year period ended 2016, we said that during the middle of this year, we were going to begin what was the most ambitious rate renewal cycle that the company had experienced in years. So this was the first big deal that we were entered into and we successfully completed it and the construction surrounding the agreement where quite constructive. So it not only bolsters our confidence in our ability to get that and those rates will kick in, in the not-too-distant future. As we've said before, just to repeat, the domestic Sub revenue should grow double-digit compound annual growth from '13 to '16. And the only other thing I would mention is that the way that the increases should come in over time over those 3 years, is that we're going to see the biggest impact in terms of growth in 2016. So beginning next year, we absolutely expect to see an acceleration in Turner's domestic affiliate rates off of current year levels. And if I was going to forecast right now, I would say that it will probably be close to double digits. In '15, it will probably moderate somewhat and then in '16, you'll see the biggest overall growth rates. So that over the 3-year period, you get to the double-digit period -- double-digit rates, excuse me.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Alexia, were you asking something about CNN rating?", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, I know that they -- I think there is a bigger opportunity, it sounds like, in terms of the potential to move up in rates at probably TNT. I was just saying that with the incredible turnaround you're seeing at CNN more recently, do you think there's also an opportunity there?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "On CPM rates?", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "No, on the renewals, yes, the renewals.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Absolutely. And I think John said it well. We're not -- we do our affiliate rate renewals across our networks. And so the strength of CNN, which as we have said and we certainly believe it, it's essentially worth a lot more in affiliate rates than the current rate that it's getting. And it's not just a function of ratings. As we mentioned in the call, the ratings are up 50% in total day and we're taking share. But the ratings have moved around. That's really not the only thing. It's actually not even the main thing. It's simply the role of in-depth, trustworthy, nonpartisan global news that CNN fills. And the strength of CNN in online and mobile broadband delivery, which is the #1 source to go to for that, whether it's breaking news or not, and certainly during breaking news. So it's very valuable. We think everything at CNN is on the uptick. Really, the quality of what it's doing and also, both the ad rates and the affiliate rates.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "A further clarification on the Turner affiliate renewal cycle, John. It's obviously encouraging, you signed a deal with a top 5 operator. I understand the reticence on giving too much detail, but could you tell us, are there other meaningful deals that you'll strike around this year end that will bolster confidence in the renewal cycle further? Or should we look to 2014 for the next piece of news on that? And the question for Jeff, just curious, your updated thoughts around online video distribution. Disney and Fox decided that Hulu was an interesting business to own. Do you see the appeal and value of having direct-to-consumer online video retail business? Or is remaining an independent wholesaler the right strategy? And to the extent the answer is different for international versus U.S., I would love to hear about that.", "John K. Martin", "So, Doug, I'll start. I think this answer's going to be pretty short. So, yes, we've got some negotiations and deals that come up for renewal before the end of this year. Some of them are big distributors. But having said that, we're not going to see the impact of those deals kick in, in 2013, which is why I'd said that we're not really going to expect to see anything in terms of the overall affiliate growth until 2014. But, yes, I mean, we've kicked off the cycle, so to speak, in terms of affiliate deals. And we've got a number of them coming up before the end of the year. But as I said, just at the risk of repeating myself, we feel good about the hand we've got, we feel good about the value that the networks have with respect to affiliates and consumers. And we have every confidence that we're going to succeed in what we're trying to do.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Doug, on your question, I think it's a good question. Look, it's for Disney, News Corp. and NBC to talk about what they're doing with Hulu and why. But having said that, I think our view of what they're doing, and it makes sense to us, is more about supporting the value of their networks and their programming across platforms than it is particularly about the discrete business of broadband-only delivery at Hulu. I think those things can be complementary and I think they're searching to get there. It seems like a good decision. What we're doing and to answer your question, we think that the best place for us for now is essentially emphasizing the very large wholesale networks and the packages over both the video plan and increasingly the broadband plan. Because as you know, we've been very -- well, we've said it over and over again. We think the move of television to an on-demand service on television and on broadband devices is a major move to support the value of TV networks, TV programs. We think it's huge. We see it all over the world. And as we look at the ways that we're going to distribute our shows and our networks across the world, we essentially try to optimize the distribution opportunity in whichever country. In the United States, it's a very powerful penetration of the giant packages of TV networks. In certain other countries, there are times when you're actually better off going really broadband-delivered. We did it recently in the Nordic countries. But it's this kind of a case-by-case thing at this point. I think it will all converge. And the key point, I think, is not which platform, it's essentially getting everything to be VOD with an interface that consumers love. And there should be deservedly and there is a lot of attention on the kind of excitement consumers and viewers have for on-demand programming. Some of it from broadband-delivered sources, but most of it from television network sources that are becoming on-demand programs and networks like HBO, which I think is probably the leader across the world in delivering the largest package of on-demand programming in all -- well, all the hemisphere. There's just 2 hemispheres. We're thinking of a third hemisphere, but we haven't gone there yet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Morris from Davenport & Company.", "Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Two topics. First is on \u00e0 la carte or unbundling of networks. I think most of us have assumed it's a bit of a nonstarter as long as the content companies and your distribution partners were both against the concept of unbundling the pay TV package. But in the last few days, you've had more commentary from Cablevision. Time Warner Cable offering to CBS to go \u00e0 la carte. So I guess my question is -- or are, number one, do you see this as an actual shift and increasing the likelihood that we would move to \u00e0 la carte, or how something like that would happen? And how do you view your network's position, would it -- does it change your strategy at all, or do you like your positioning regardless of how that plays out? And then I have one on HBO.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. We don't think it results a big change yet. And we do think we're very well-positioned. If there is a chance, I don't think it goes to \u00e0 la carte. We think it probably would move, if it does, to smaller bundles of kind of appropriately placed together kinds of networks. We do think we'd be really well-positioned in that scenario. What would happen is there would be more money for the biggest networks like ours. And in fact, of all the programming groups out there, Turner Time Warner has the highest proportion of our networks among the top 4. And that's just on the Turner side. If you add HBO, it's more. We'd also have the highest proportion of our affiliate fees from our biggest networks. We have about 85% to 90% from our top 4 networks. And those networks would be highly likely to be in any base package that anybody's going to create. So we don't believe we'd be vulnerable. It will probably, actually, increase our relative advantage. It would be good for HBO because lower-priced packages would effectively make HBO even more affordable. So that's how we look at it. We doubt that it will happen, but if it happens, it probably helps us. We do think there would be some of the weaker networks or weaker network groups that would fail, which would reduce the diversity of voices out there. It's not necessarily in the public interest. We don't really think that many legislators have shown any desire to take up this issue. And there's been a lot of misstatement and misinformation around it. So that's why we don't think it's probably going to take off. But if it does, it will probably happen in a way that helps us. You have a question on HBO?", "Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Yes. And just quickly, John. You mentioned the mix of HBO subs being a little bit of, I guess, maybe a drag sequentially from the first quarter on the affiliate growth rate. My question is, as you go into these negotiations, we've been very focused on Turner, but is there an opportunity to change the terms of HBO to perhaps get a bit more of the economics in the future?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, let me answer it. We don't think that's optimal for us. We've been -- really, the design of HBO affiliate rate structures are very much the -- our creation and very much in the interest of HBO. And as -- due to the nature of them, typically, distributors that have been performing better are more likely to have a higher proportion of non-revenue-generating subs because they've got incentive to have more subs and average down there effective per sub rate because they have higher penetration. That means we get a full ride on our rate increases, which are fairly strong. The poor-performing affiliates, once they get below that benchmark, as they lose subs, they basically lose revenue-generating subs for us. Of course, they're also losing revenue-generating subs for themselves and their average rate goes up. So we think it's the kind of an effective tool. We focus on a combination of penetration from different distributors. Remember, satellite, telco and cable distributors compete with each other in given geographic areas and we find this an effective tool to motivate or incentivize the appropriate competition between them to sell HBO. And as you know, HBO's the anchor service for all high-value packages. There are no high-value packages out there that don't have HBO in them. So we think it's working fine for us. And the way to look at it, essentially, the earnings growth at HBO, what we would do to improve it is we're always working with our affiliates. We have some things underway right now which I won't talk about specifically, because some affiliates are performing better than others that are going to, essentially, incentivize the underperforming affiliates to do better. And that's upside for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "My question is on the new affiliate deal and how that pertains to the NBA. So I'm assuming, or presumably, the new affiliate deal extends beyond the 2016. I don't know if you can confirm that, but if we could assume that the duration of the new deal goes beyond the duration of your current NBA deal, which I think ends in the middle of the 2016 season, I guess my question is, do the affiliates see NBA as being a must-have piece of content for Turner as part of that deal? And so does that really put the onus on you guys to renew and negotiate a sooner time period with the NBA? And so for us as investors, I guess the question would be that given how crucial the NBA presumably is, how are you thinking about maintaining financial and economic discipline as you go into that renegotiation with the NBA?", "John K. Martin", "Anthony, it's John. You know what, unfortunately, and I hope you can understand this, I mean, we're not going to comment specifically on the duration of the deal that we did. But Jeff may have something to say about the NBA specifically.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, which is not much more. It's one of the longest and strongest partnerships we have with any league. And we do have the right, as you said, through the 2015, '16 season. We not only license the content, but we manage both NBA TV and the NBA digital properties for the league. We're confident this relationship will continue for many years to come. And we all know, it's in your question, that sports rates are going up. We feel pretty good about our position there and our ability to pay that and continue to have the earnings growth we've been showing you. And we really don't want to, obviously, say much more about it because we're talking about significant amounts of money. And I think you would want us to just go off and keep securing the programming that we judge it wise to have.", "John K. Martin", "The only thing I would add to that, Anthony, just to keep in mind, and this is by design, the entertainment networks at Turner are hybrid networks, right? And the programming falls into different buckets, whether it's originals, which is getting an increasing percentage of the schedule, or sports, or acquired TV shows and movies. So I think last year, it was about 70% acquired, 20% originals, 10% sports. And it's moving much more towards originals. But just think about, sports is incredibly important, but I think the NBA represents 3% of our overall programming in terms of hours. So we have a lot of other programming that's extremely valuable to the affiliates and extremely valuable to consumers. So the NBA is important, but we're going to be okay no matter what.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne Agee.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I have a two-part question on margins at the Networks. I think a couple of years ago, you guys laid out at your Analyst Day, the HBO margin expansion pass where the non-programming costs will be contained and the revenue growth will lead to that. So I was wondering if HBO margins have been expanding in recent years? And then if it's still the trajectory that you see in the next 2 or 3 years? And then with the Turner affiliate fee accelerating, should we also expect an incremental margin expansion, that is -- or do you think all of the incremental revenue will be absorbed and spent into -- on programming?", "John K. Martin", "Thanks for the question. Look, I think if you look back over the last 5 to 7 years at the Networks group, and this would be true for each of HBO and Turner, in any given year, margins expand roughly 100 basis points a year. And that could be a little bit more in some years, a little bit less in other years. And I think the best indicator of the future is probably looking at the past because I think that's kind of a trend and that sort of a trajectory should continue. All of the elements of the HBO margin story that we laid out in the Analyst Day from a number of years ago, those are absolutely still intact. But it's not just an HBO margin expansion story, the same thing's happening at Turner. And if you look at this quarter, as just an indication, we had at the Networks group, I think 7% revenue growth, 4% expense growth. But if you look at the expense growth and decompose it, in this quarter, we had 8% programming expense growth. That means all of the rest of the expenses at the Networks group were down. And that doesn't come easily. That comes by hard work. But nevertheless, we have a lot of control over our nonstrategic expenses. And our goal is to hold those to growth in any given year of no more than low single-digits. And we think programming costs are going to grow in any given year of no more than mid to high single-digits. So that means overall expenses in any given year at the Networks should grow mid single-digits and we think revenue growth is going to outpace that each and every year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi.", "Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I know you mentioned on the call that the timing spend is getting pushed out a little bit. I was wondering, have you guys established the capital structure that you intend to put on Time Inc. once it spins out?", "John K. Martin", "Jason, it's John, I'll just take it. The answer is no. There's a considerable amount of work that's going on and there's lots of different work streams associated with all aspects of the spin. With Joe just being named as a CEO and a new CFO being named, I think as recently as 2 days ago, we look forward to a collaborative process working with them and the rest of the team. One of the things I think we've said is, is we want the capital structure of Time Inc. to represent or provide Time Inc. with the best possible path to success. And we want the equity of the spun company to be attractive. So we're going to be looking very closely at the amount of debt that we think is optimal for the Time Inc. company and some sort of a dividend policy that we think will be optimal. And anything that we would likely do, because we haven't made a decision, will leave Time Warner remain co as a leverage ratio that should be similar to where we are today, is another way to think about it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Barton Crockett from Lazard Capital Markets.", "Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to ask just a follow-up to the discussion of the acceleration of the Turner affiliate fees, 2014 to 2016. How much of that drops to the bottom line? In other words, when you look out to this revenue acceleration, do you also in your mind think can I give this a bucket to invest more in things like programming maybe for a sports rights feed, or is it really kind of purely incremental profit?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Can I start? All of it, I guess, is the short answer. It's an increase in marginal revenue and so it's discretionary whether you want to spend and all of it went to the bottom line, or whether we took -- we obviously have some percentage of total revenue that goes to costs we decide to make. But you want to ask it in a different way?", "Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "[indiscernible]", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "What did you say, I'm sorry?", "Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I think you answered it. Yes, I think you're saying there's no change in your expense trend as you get that boost in revenue, so it does drop to the bottom line.", "John K. Martin", "Yes, I mean, any of the investments we would choose to make would be discretionary. And I would just sort of mention for context, we already spend an awful lot of money on programming. So we've got meaningful scale. And so we'll make the decisions based on the competitive dynamics. But to have extra money in revenue is a nice thing to have.", "Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one other question, if I can. I was wondering if you could comment on the discussion of new over-the-top services, like Intel has been in the press with things they look to launch. So without talking specifically about things like Intel, but the general kind of category of new multi-channel over-the-top services, how do you gauge the probability of something meaningful coming to you in revenues in terms of like minimum guarantees for these new services over the next few quarters or the next few years?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, okay. No one showed up on the horizon with anything that looks like that yet. We've had conversations across our businesses with many technology companies, vendors, others that want to be distributors, some of them over-the-top. And we'll evaluate each business and opportunity within the context, number one, of our overall business; and number two, of what we would think might be the sustainability of what some of these new entrants are proposing. We're not philosophically opposed to it. We just -- we don't see it as being viable through any of the suspects -- usual suspects yet. Take some examples, Intel hasn't launched yet. So I don't know what they're going to do or whether they're going to do that. Apple, we talk to all the time, and there's none that we know of that are interesting opportunities, in our view.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So, Jeff, you've obviously made some pretty meaningful leadership changes across the business, most recently at the Turner networks. And when you gave the job to John to run the networks and, I guess, and David did work for him, what essentially were the -- like, what's the mandate to take this great business, what is it that they are supposed to do? What did you say was -- you expected of them? What is like the 1 or 2 key goals that you expect to see them execute as the new leadership team or leadership?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, I want to start by saying I'm very happy. And all companies from the top management of the divisions, the corporate, the board, we're all really excited about the team that we have across all the divisions. And I think that -- I'm personally really excited and happy about how smoothly all the transitions went, how much of a bench we've got and how we were able to promote from within in pretty much all of these cases. So there's an -- there's a body of both relationships and knowledge that are working together in a way that Time Warner hasn't had in previous years. In terms of the specifics at Turner, Phil and the management at Turner, which certainly David Levy, who's picking up some new responsibilities, working closer with Steve Koonin and Stu Snyder now and their jobs as TBS, TNT, Turner Classic Movies and truTV gets stronger and they become a bigger part of a kind of programming evolution in the entire network business, not just in our company but across the industry; but also the regeneration of momentum at CNN with Jeff Zucker. The tremendous moves and the real fast growth that Gerhard Zeiler is making in all our international businesses, including a new cooperation and level of kind of joint action between HBO and Turner and Warners all over the world. These are all the things that got under way. Phil put a lot of these people in place, not just Phil but this whole team has got tremendous initiatives under way. I think Turner is the leading company on digital transformation of its networks, to VOD and to broadband-delivered TV Everywhere. We have fuller offerings and more deals in place than anybody else. So what John is going to do is go and join that momentum and continue to evolve it as it has been. That's pretty similar to what Kevin's doing at Warner's with a great team there. The team at HBO, with Richard and Eric, has continued to just move forward. So it's really the same answer across the company. It's just a new generation that has been here, which is reaching the point in their careers where they can take the next step.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital IQ.", "Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research", "So first question for John. The numbers you threw out in terms of the 5-year record of your return allocation between share buybacks and dividends, I think if my math is correct, that kind of forks out to north of 130% return rate, which I have to say is pretty remarkable. So I guess, the question is, is there any reason why you think that this kind of momentum or rate may not be sustainable after the spinoff? I mean, if anything, I would imagine it would probably even trend higher than that. So any kind of color around that would be helpful. And separately for Jeff, so Game of Thrones, obviously has had a phenomenal performance. But one other issue that has also come up with regard to that title is the online piracy, I think, by all accounts, one of the highest-pirated show and I'm not aware what you guys have done to kind of address that. It almost seems like you've kind of viewed that as kind of a compliment in terms of just kind of looking the other way. So I'm not sure if that's kind of the right thinking. Is that a paradigm shift in terms of how you kind of look at some -- the piracy and its impact on some of the shows that's going forward? If you can touch on that and what you've done, that would be helpful.", "John K. Martin", "So, Tuna, I'll start with respect to your first question. I think it's true to say that for at least 5, 5.5 years, we've had a very, very consistent policy as it relates to managing the balance sheet, capital structure and capital allocation. And we have believed and continue to believe, that having a balanced approach of delivering shareholder returns in many forms through earnings growth and a direct dividend and supplemented with share repurchases opportunistically, coupled with maintaining a balance sheet that remains strong and provides adequate strategic flexibility, that, that policy has served the company well. And we have been able to deploy a lot of capital over the last 5 years. And as you appropriately pointed out, more than 100% of what was generated. The only thing I would say, looking backwards, is we did go through a period where we took up the balance sheet leverage. When we spun off Time Warner Cable and we received the $9.25 billion dividend, the company was underlevered and we used that opportunity to more appropriately optimize the capital structure. So now, the 2.5x leverage ratio will be basically the governor, at least for the near term, as it relates to what we will do and how we'll allocate capital. And as I said in my proactive remarks, we ended the quarter a little bit below that, about 2.3x. I do think, though, as you think about Time Warner post the Time Inc. spin, the spun company will be the company that probably is the least predictable in terms of free cash flow generation over the next several years. So what will remain at Time Warner is, essentially, 90% of the company is from the TV ecosystem, which is incredibly predictable, incredibly robust. And we'll feel really good and really confident about our free cash flow generation for the foreseeable future. So we need to take that into consideration as we think about capital allocation going forward. But I don't think we're contemplating, at this point, steering away from what we've done. I think what we've done and how we've managed the company has served us well.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Tuna, on Game of Thrones at HBO. I have to confess, I think you're right. I admit, our first reaction to it, to how much people want to watch it -- now, first of all, it's got ratings of 14 million, 15 million. A lot of it is VOD on your TV system, a fair amount, an increasing amount of it is VOD on your GO service. So it's really strengthening not just the image and the engagement of our subs with HBO programming, it's also getting them familiar and very involved in using the Video on Demand capabilities of HBO. And don't forget the television part, the part where you go to your house and you turn on that big screen TV and you're watching it over the video plan. Also, the HBO GO service, which the Game of Thrones is the leading introduction manual for how to use HBO GO, which more and more millions of people are doing. If you then go to people watching it that aren't subs, it's a tremendous word-of-mouth thing. The issue would be if they were doing it and because they could get it, not subscribing. We don't see much of that. Basically we've been dealing with this issue for years at HBO, where, literally, 20, 30 years, where people have always been running wires down the back of apartment buildings and sharing with their neighbors. Our experience is, it all leads to more penetration, more paying subs and more health for HBO, less reliance on having to do paid advertising. We don't do a lot of paid advertising on HBO. We let the programming and the reviews talk for us. And it seems to be working. If you go around the world, I think you're right, that Game of Thrones is the most pirated show in the world. Now that's better than an Emmy.", "Douglas Shapiro", "All right. Dawn, I think we're actually out of time here. So we're going to have to make that the last question.", "And thanks, everybody, for listening in and we'll talk to you soon.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Richard, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Time Warner. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's third quarter earnings conference call. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter and the other reaffirming our 2013 business outlook.", "Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's available on our website.", "And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "Thank you, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff? Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. We had another great quarter and we're on track for another very successful year.", "In the third quarter, we grew adjusted operating income 8%, adjusted earnings per share increased 20%, and we returned over $1.3 billion to our stockholders through buybacks and our dividend.", "So it was a very strong quarter from a financial perspective. And just as important, we continue to perform at the top of our game operationally and to lay the foundation for continued growth.", "For example, at Turner we're seeing a significant payoff from the investments we've been making to bolster and refresh our program. That was evident in advertising revenue, which was up double-digits again this quarter, and it was evident in ratings, where TBS was the #2 cable network in prime across adults 18 to 34 and 18 to 49 in the quarter.", "The ongoing strength of the Big Bang Theory is a big part of that success, both in drawing audiences and as a launching pad for original programming.", "TBS recently renewed 3 of its originals, Sullivan & Son, Men at Work and Deal With It for additional seasons. And in the fourth quarter, TBS is continuing to build out its lineup of original series with the launch of 3 new shows including a show called Ground Floor. That's a comedy from Warner's.", "TBS investment in Major League Baseball is also paying dividends. The National League Championship Series grew prime time viewers by 14% over 2011, which is the last time it aired on TBS.", "TNT has also continued to benefit from investments in programming, finishing the quarter as the #2 network on cable among adults 25 to 54 in total day. Its growing slate of hit originals included 4 of the top 10 scripted shows on cable this quarter: Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes, Falling Skies and Perception. Over the next month, TNT will bring back Major Crimes and Boston's Finest, and it will premiere 2 new shows: Marshall Law: Texas, which is an unscripted show from Jerry Bruckheimer, as well as the highly anticipated miniseries, Mob City from Frank Darabont.", "Last week, the NBA also kicked off its regular season on TNT. That marks its 30th year with Turner. The season-opener between the Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls was the second highest-rated opening night in TNT history, and Thursday night's doubleheader grew viewership by 14% over last season's first Thursday night telecast.", "We're also continuing to make gains at CNN. This quarter, CNN grew total day ratings in its key demo by 15%, while its 2 principal competitors showed year-over-year declines. And it finished ahead of MSNBC in both total viewers and adults 25 to 54 for the second straight quarter. Well, there's still lots of work to be done, but CNN is showing real progress, particularly in revamped programming blocks like the morning show, where New Day drove viewership up almost 30% over the year-ago quarter.", "Adult Swim is having a great year as well. It just finished the most-watched quarter in its history, growing over 20% with adults 18 to 34 in total day. It was the #1 ad-supported cable network in total day among 18- to 34-year-olds for the 22nd straight time, and for the first time, it was also #1 in prime time among adults 18 to 34.", "Across the board, the Turner networks continued to deliver great value to our customers, our advertisers and our distributors. That was evident in our recent affiliate renewal with another top distributor. During this affiliate renewal cycle, we've now signed renewals with 4 of the top 10 U.S. distributors, reinforcing our confidence in Turner's ability to accelerate its domestic subscription revenue growth starting next year.", "Turning to HBO. We're also benefiting from our investments in great programming. You don't have to take my word for it. The rest of the industry is saying it for us. HBO won 27 prime time Emmy Awards this year. That's the most of any network for the 12th straight year. That included 11 awards for Behind the Candelabra and 5 for Boardwalk Empire, making them the 2 biggest winners this year.", "And the distinctiveness and the excellence of HBO's programming is apparent in its subscriber trends, which have been very positive both here in the U.S. and around the world. Outside the U.S., HBO is on track for another year of double-digit growth in subscribers. And on that front, we recently acquired the interest in HBO Asia and in HBO South Asia that we did not previously own. By wholly owning these ventures, we think HBO will be able to better capitalize on the growth opportunities in the region.", "Let me turn to Warner Bros., which is hitting on all cylinders. In television, Warner's is once again supplying more shows to the broadcast networks than any other studio. That includes the top 2 series on television, The Big Bang Theory and The Voice, which have both seen ratings growth over the last season.", "Beyond the broadcast networks, we continue to see very strong demand from cable networks, SVOD services and international territories for both originals and off-net syndication.", "Looking across cable and broadcast, Warner Bros. TV is producing 63 shows this season. That's up from 55 last season. And that includes the highest number of returning series in more than 30 years.", "In syndication, Warner's benefited from the domestic cable sale of The Middle this quarter, and added to its pipeline with the sale of Person of Interest, which will premiere on cable in 2015.", "At the film studio, Warner's released 2 sleeper hits in the third quarter, The Conjuring and We're the Millers, which have grossed over $300 million and $260 million, respectively, at the global box office.", "Warner's followed that up with the release of Gravity, which is a phenomenon, both in terms of critical acclaim and commercial success. As most of you know, Gravity set an October record for an opening weekend domestically, and it's on track to gross over $0.5 billion at the global box office.", "Thanks to those titles and other global hits like Man of Steel and The Great Gatsby, Warner Bros. is #1 at the domestic box office so far this year and, of course, the second installment in The Hobbit franchise will storm into theaters next month.", "In September, Warner Bros. also took a major step in securing its franchise pipeline with the announcement of an expanded creative relationship with J.K. Rowling. As the centerpiece of that relationship, she will write a series of original films that revisit the magical world she created in the Harry Potter novels. Like the many millions of fans of her great work, we're excited to see what new adventures Jo has in store for us.", "Before I finish, let me take a minute to update you on the timing of the Time Inc. spin. Joe Ripp and his team have been in place for a couple of months now, and they're making great progress in preparing Time Inc. to become an independent publicly traded company. We anticipate making the initial filing of our Form 10 in the next few weeks. That should put us in a position to complete the spinoff during the second quarter of next year. As many of you know, the separation of Time Inc. will be the culmination of the process we started over 5 years ago to refocus Time Warner on being a pure-play content company, with an emphasis on video and television in particular.", "I think you can see the positive impact that focus is having on our results. At the same time, we know that capital allocation could be as important to stockholder returns as operational excellence. So far this year, we've returned almost $4 billion to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we remain committed to maintaining an efficient capital structure and to providing direct returns to our stockholders going forward as well.", "In closing, I'm really pleased with our results so far this year. We still have a lot of work to do, but I'm more confident than ever in our strategic position and our ability to maintain attractive growth and returns for many years to come.", "With that, I'll turn it over to John for his final earnings call as our Chief Financial & Administrative Officer. John's leadership has been a key ingredient to the success of Time Warner in recent years, and I'm confident that will continue to be the case in his new role as CEO of Turner. John?", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website.", "And starting with our consolidated results. We had another really great quarter, and off of flat revenues, adjusted income rose 8%, making this our most profitable third quarter ever. And that was mainly due to solid double-digit growth at the Networks segment and company-wide, adjusted operating income margins expanded almost 180 basis points year-over-year, and that's the eighth time in the last 9 quarters that margins have expanded year-over-year.", "We've been able to do that by staying very, very focused on costs, and continued cost discipline has been critical to our ability to invest aggressively while also increasing margins and it remains a significant focus for the company.", "Adjusted EPS grew 20% in the quarter, and that marks the 13th out of the last 16 quarters that adjusted EPS has grown double-digits. And, once again, we were able to grow adjusted EPS faster than adjusted operating income, and that was helped by a lower effective tax rate, as well as our ongoing share repurchase program.", "The acceleration in our share repurchases this quarter is evidence of our continued commitment to providing returns to stockholders. Year-to-date, we've returned almost $4 billion, and that includes $3 billion in buybacks and $811 million in dividends. And that's almost 25% more than we returned during the same period in 2012, and it includes $1.2 billion in share repurchases since we last reported earnings.", "Our year-to-date operating results have also been really, really good, with adjusted operating income up 12% and adjusted EPS up 25%. And that's despite an almost 300 basis-point drag on growth in adjusted operating income from Time Inc. and the inclusion of foreign exchange movements, as well as incremental equity losses associated with the company's nearly 50% investment in CME.", "Given the strength in these year-to-date results, let me just touch on our outlook for a moment, which calls for mid-teens growth and adjusted EPS for the full year 2013, which we reaffirmed this morning.", "Just doing the math, that implies a fourth quarter adjusted EPS to be about flat relative to last year, which is obviously a significant deceleration from the first 9 months of this year. And that's due largely to decisions that we've made about our programming schedule, as well as related marketing spend at the Networks segment. I'll discuss that more in detail in a few minutes.", "Our outlook for the fourth quarter also reflects very difficult comparison to Warner Bros., continued pressure at Time Inc. and higher expected equity losses related to CME. And for the year, we now assume about a $0.10 negative impact to adjusted EPS as a result of our equity accounting at CME, and that's an obvious disappointment.", "But putting this all in perspective, we fully expect 2013 to mark the fifth consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and it's going to be another record year for the company. So we feel really good about the underlying trends in virtually all of our businesses, and with the momentum we saw in the third quarter, we've got even more confidence about our ability to drive further growth in years to come.", "So let me now turn to our divisional segment highlights, and let me begin with the Networks segment. Adjusted operating income here in the third quarter was up a very strong 12%, and it's been up double-digits through the first 9 months of the year. Advertising revenues once again grew double-digits, and that was largely due as a result of very positive trends at both domestic entertainment as well as our international networks.", "Domestic advertising was up high single-digits in the quarter. And that included double-digit growth at the entertainment networks, which included kids and young adults, and that was somewhat offset by a slight decline at domestic news.", "International advertising increased high-teens despite a several hundred basis-point drag from foreign exchange. And that reflected very healthy growth across all regions, with particular strength in Latin America.", "And while it's somewhat difficult to measure, we believe both domestic and international advertising trends were helped on a year-over-year basis this year by the absence of the Olympics in the third quarter.", "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, scatter pricing at the entertainment networks is up double-digits over the upfront, and we anticipate high single-digit advertising growth at domestic entertainment including kids.", "Domestic news is likely to be down double-digits year-over-year, however, and that's because of the comparison against the U.S. presidential election last year, as well as ongoing softness in the news advertising marketplace in general.", "Similarly, we are seeing a sequential deceleration in international advertising growth in the fourth quarter, and that is owing partially to difficult comparisons against last year's fourth quarter, specifically in Latin America and Europe.", "So in total, we would expect advertising growth at Turner to be somewhere in the mid single-digits in the fourth quarter, when you take into consideration the ups and downs that I just went through.", "Moving on, subscription revenue growth of 4% in Q3 was consistent with the mid single-digit growth in the first half of the year, and was perfectly in line with our expectations. A stronger U.S. dollar continues to weigh on growth here in the quarter, and we expect that that is going to continue to be the case in the fourth quarter as well.", "However, we continue to see healthy underlying subscriber dynamics in international territories, particularly at Latin America. And as Jeff just mentioned, Turner recently secured an affiliate renewal with an additional top 10 U.S. distributor.", "We've also seen some encouraging subscriber trends at HBO, so we remain confident that we're going to see a real acceleration in subscriber revenues beginning in 2014.", "Adjusted operating income at the Networks was up 12% in the quarter, with margins increasing 220 basis points year-over-year, and that's the sixth quarter in a row of margin expansion at this segment.", "In addition to Networks segment revenue growth, margin expansion was helped by an extremely modest increase in expenses of less than 2% in the quarter, and that was largely a result of the timing of programming spend, which was down versus last year's third quarter.", "Looking at the fourth quarter for a moment, we anticipate a pretty big year-over-year ramp in our original programming investment and related marketing spend. And that's a result of more than an 80% increase in original episodes at Turner, as well as an increase in spending on both original series and original films at HBO.", "We're also investing at CNN, and that's part of a strategic decision to broaden the programming beyond merely breaking news and politics. Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown and Morgan Spurlock's Inside Man are 2 early efforts in this area, and they're among 2 of CNN's highest-rated shows this year. And their success suggests that there are meaningful opportunities for CNN beyond merely breaking news and politics. Programming investments such as these will likely put some pressure on CNN's margins in the near-term, but they will also open up a new pool of advertisers to CNN, and they could position the network for a return to attractive growth over time.", "For the fourth quarter, there are just a couple of other items to keep in mind here at the Networks segment. First, we anticipate a drop in content revenue as a result of continued soft demand for catalog product and fewer home video releases at HBO. In addition, we recently acquired the remaining interests in HBO Asia and HBO South Asia, so we now own 100% of each and will start consolidating for accounting purposes their operating results in the fourth quarter. This is part of an ongoing effort to accelerate HBO's international growth, and that leaves HBO Latin America group as the only significant international HBO joint venture that we do not consolidate.", "The consolidation of HBO's properties in Asia will benefit subscription revenue growth, but it's actually going to be a slight drag on operating profit in the fourth quarter, mostly as a result of seasonality. But together with HBO Nordic, which we started consolidating earlier this year for accounting purposes, we expect the negative impact on adjusted operating income to be around $15 million for the fourth quarter. And, obviously, these ventures are still in investment phases, and we fully anticipate that they're going to pay off and become really attractive investments for us over time.", "But taking that all into account, we anticipate the network's adjusted operating income will be approximately flat in the fourth quarter of 2013, and that's, obviously, not a typical quarter for us from a year-over-year growth rate perspective, which is why we wanted to share a little bit more detail with you.", "Still with 1 quarter left to go, we remain absolutely on track for another year of margin expansion and some pretty strong growth in adjusted operating income at the Networks group.", "And with the investments we're making in these businesses, we're positioning ourselves to grow at very attractive levels for the foreseeable future.", "Turning now to Film and TV production at Warner's. We knew coming into this year that we had very tough comparisons in the second half of the year in both the third and the fourth quarter, and in line with our expectations, revenue was down 7% and adjusted operating income was down 8% in Q3. But year-to-date, Warner's is having a terrific year and its adjusted operating income is still up double-digits.", "Despite the declines in the quarter, we're very, very pleased with Warner's operating performance. And, as Jeff noted, some highlights, We're the Millers and The Conjuring were both extremely successful releases at the box office.", "On the TV side, the third quarter benefited from the domestic cable sale of The Middle, and we continue to see very good demand for our product globally. This is evident in the number of new shows we have on broadcast this season and the strong pricing we're getting when we're selling those shows in international territories.", "Across theatrical and TV, Warner Home Entertainment revenue declined 9% in the quarter, and that was principally due to the timing of SVOD availabilities at the CW, which shifted from Q3 to Q4 this year as a result of the later start of its season.", "In addition, we have seen some softness in the home entertainment sales of our television product as of late, including catalog.", "For the industry, however, home entertainment sales fell just slightly in the quarter and they actually remained up for the year. And electronic sell-through grew more than 50% in the quarter and year-to-date for the industry, and we think that's an extremely positive sign for the future of the Home Entertainment business, and we're focused on improving the consumer experience in order to further accelerate the shift to digital ownership.", "Looking ahead, Warner's has very difficult comparisons against last year's fourth quarter, which happened to be an all-time record quarter for Warner Bros. So year-over-year growth may be tough, but we expect profits to significantly exceed the third quarter of this year. And we're off to a great start with the success of Gravity, and we'll also benefit from the next Hobbit film. We'll benefit from the recognition of the CW SVOD revenue and the games release of Batman Arkham Origins. So it should still be our biggest quarter of the year and among the largest-ever for Warner's in terms of adjusted operating income. And that's going to put Warner's firmly on track to grow profits this year and potentially have its best year ever. So we're quite pleased with that.", "Moving over to Time Inc. Advertising revenue was down 2% in the quarter. Domestic print advertising increased, but that was due largely to a shift of an issue of both People and Sports Illustrated into the third quarter from the fourth quarter. And without this shift, domestic print ad revenue would have been up marginally in the quarter, but overall, advertising would have declined by over 3%. And that's due to softness in non-magazine as well as international advertising.", "Subscription revenues also benefited by more than 200 basis points as a result of the additional issues in the third quarter. Despite that, subscription revenue was down 4% in the quarter, and that was principally due to continued softness in newsstand sales.", "Looking ahead, we expect both advertising and subscription revenues to be negatively affected in the fourth quarter by the shift of the issues that I just mentioned into the third quarter. In addition, the improvement in trends in domestic print advertising that we experienced in the third quarter doesn't seem to be continuing yet in the fourth quarter.", "Adjusted operating income was down 8% in Q3, as ongoing cost control efforts weren't enough to offset the revenue declines. And given the continued revenue pressure that we expect, we think adjusted operating income is going to be down in the fourth quarter at Time Inc.", "Let me move on and talk for a minute about free cash flow. 2013 is going to shape up to be an absolutely terrific year in terms of free cash flow generation. Year-to-date, we've generated almost $2.9 billion of free cash. That's up almost 50% versus the same period in 2012, and is almost as much as we generated in all of last year. And that's mostly due to the strong growth in adjusted operating income as well as an expected improvement in working capital.", "Capital expenditures and cash taxes are also lower year-to-date. The biggest drivers of the change in working capital have been lower payments for certain license programs, the timing of sports programming payments and higher reimbursements from prior film co-financings.", "The decline in cash taxes was primarily a result of tax law extenders that were cast by Congress in January of this year. And that's been a positive for us all year.", "So with our solid performance year-to-date and with just a few months to go, we're fully on track for a really, really strong year in 2013 as it relates to free cash flow.", "So let me move on and just talk for a minute about the balance sheet and net debt. We ended the third quarter with a little bit more than $17.5 billion in net debt. That's up about $570 million from the end of last year and that's mainly due to the, roughly, almost $3.5 billion of capital returned to shareholders in the first 9 months of the year through dividends and share repurchases. And that includes an acceleration in our share repurchases in the quarter to almost $1.1 billion. Consistent with recent years, the amount of capital return significantly exceeds the free cash flow we've generated year-to-date.", "On a transaction front, I do want to highlight that Warner Bros. entered into a multi-year agreement to co-finance as many as 75 movies with RatPac-Dune Entertainment. Along with its existing co-financing arrangement with Village Roadshow, we think this provides Warner's with very attractive flexibility to manage the risk of its film slate while optimizing its return on investment. So we feel really good about that and we're pleased with that development.", "Balance sheet leverage remained steady at about 2.3x. That's a little bit below our target of 2.5x, and that's despite the acceleration in our share repurchase program that occurred during the quarter. And that was a result of the continued strong free cash flow generation that I just mentioned a few minutes ago.", "So that concludes my remarks. With that, let me turn it back over to Mike and we'll start the Q&A portion of the call.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, John. Richard, can we please start the Q&A? [Operator Instructions] Richard?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question online comes from Mr. Ben Swinburne for Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Question for either/or both of you on sort of John's move down to Turner. The business is obviously performing very well, but I'd love to hear more about what you think the big opportunities are beyond what we all know about on the affiliate fee side? What are you thinking about changes in programming, efficiencies on the cost side, some of the momentum at CNN, the international opportunity? What are the things that, John, you and the -- and your team are going to be focused on as you head down to that business? And then on CME, just any comments on your plans there, and what the carrying value of that asset is now. There's been a lot of focus on that this week in the news.", "John K. Martin", "Ben, it's John. Listen, it's a little early to start talking about my new role at Turner, since it doesn't begin until January 1. So please be sensitive and appreciate to that. But look, I'm really excited. It is a great opportunity for me to work with great people and great brands. And look, I think we here believe that as the television ecosystem evolves, the big brands are going to continue to get stronger, and that's going to come as weaker and less developed brands are going to be more and more difficulty in surviving and succeeding. And so we're playing from an advantaged hand, and we're going to be operating 2 of the most profitable networks in the world, with TBS and TNT. They've got huge programming budgets. We want to attract the very best projects we can. We want to delight the viewers. We want to maintain our position right at the very top of the cable networks universe. We see opportunities, frankly, in lots of places. We see them in general entertainment. I think Adult Swim is a huge opportunity. I think truTV, under the new leadership of Chris Linn who came over from Viacom's MTV, you're going to see a completely refreshed lineup of programming sometime in 2014. It's going to be much better. I think with CNN, there's opportunities. Just to go back to what I even said in my prepared remarks, I think CNN and with the experimentation that Jeff and the leadership team did there with some shows like Anthony Bourdain, Morgan Spurlock, some of the movies that they've put on that have attracted younger audiences, bigger audiences, that complemented with the unparalleled news-breaking capabilities is demonstration that it's reinforcing the value to the affiliates and consumers and, increasingly, we want to reinforce the value to the advertisers. So I'm really excited. I'm working with a world-class team and, obviously, the world-class team up here, and we see bright days ahead.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "And also, you asked about CME?", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "And as CME has disclosed, being a public company, we are in discussions about a capital transaction including a potential loan to CME. We have confidence in the new management. We think CME has very interesting long-term opportunities. So we're only going to engage in a transaction there if it's fair for our shareholders. And, certainly, it has to be fair to theirs. So while there's no guarantee we will come to an agreement, we are -- we've been and remain very interested in what CME might do. And yes, it's had some difficult performance recently, but we think that the market is a very interesting opportunity, the markets that they are in.", "Operator", "Our next question online comes from Mr. Michael Nathanson for MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "I have one for Jeff and one for John. Jeff, let me just ask you about HBO and the Comcast test you guys are running? Over the many years, you guys have always said that HBO's real opportunity is the 70 million people who don't pay for HBO. And you also said that people who watch HBO like to watch a lot of TV. So given those 2 data points, how are you thinking about the test that Comcast is running? And then I have one for John.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "You're asking about this new kind of smaller bundle of Internet service with", "[Audio Gap]", "video? Is that what you're asking?", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Right. Right, exactly.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes. Well, it's a new offer. It's fairly targeted. It's a pretty limited video offering, not in the sense of HBO, which is a fantastic video and broadband offering. So it won't probably be attractive for most people, but it might be, as I think you're asking, something that appeals to a segment. We've always thought that it makes sense, and we've done this for 30 years of HBO, to try to work with distributors to make packages that make HBO available to every group of basic or wireline-connected subscribers. So that's an interesting thing for HBO. It could be an effective way to reach the 8 million or 10 million homes with broadband that don't have multichannel TV. The only thing we'd add is, what -- great, we're interested, we're supportive. I think what we've all got to see is whether there's an interest, because there's another, as you mentioned, 60 million or 70 million basic TV subs, many of whom would like to have HBO and there may be ways to get -- there are places where the penetration of HBO would naturally be much higher in the basic video households. And so HBO is working hard with some key distributors on that.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "And is that opportunity gated by your affiliate deals? Like do you have to work through new HBO affiliate deals to give you more flexibility?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "No, no, no. No gating at all. Affiliates can all create all kinds of whatever packages that they really think would be attractive to subscribers, whether the subs have basic cable and want a better premium offer, or whether they're not video subs and they're broadband subs and they want a video offer that has HBO.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay. Let me just ask John on SVOD. You flagged the CW timing. When you look at the year-over-year change in SVOD for you guys, do you expect it to be up for the year? And if so, what kind of percentage growth are you seeing SVOD this year?", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Michael. Look, year-to-date we've booked about $200 million at SVOD revenue. And last year we had about $350 million. We already expect, because of the CW pushing out into Q4, we already know there's a good chunk of money coming in that will be recognized and booked in Q4 as well. That, plus deals that we see in the pipeline, probably mean we'll be comparable year-over-year, with a little bit of luck, maybe a little bit of upside, but probably not a hell of a lot. But we are -- we continue to be encouraged by the breadth of SVOD providers that we're doing business with. If you just think about the amounts booked to date, 2/3 of that are coming from outside of the U.S. It's disproportionately TV and Netflix only represents half of overall booked revenues. So there's a lot of players that are increasingly interested in the SVOD window, and we continue to see it as a real opportunity. So we're confident. It's going to continue to be a significant revenue stream for us again this year. It may even grow, as I just mentioned. But I do want to just mention and keep in perspective that it's still a very, very small percentage of our overall revenue and even Warner's revenue. Warner's is a massive scale studio. It's only around 10% of our TV syndication revenue last year, and it's just 3% of our total film and TV revenue. So it might be more important for some of the other players in this space to make great shows, and we sell them for lots of different players and lots of different windows. And we'll continue to look to how to optimize the control of these assets so that we can maximize their value going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question online comes from Mr. Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "A couple of questions. Jeff, you talked about the increasing focus on originals at Turner again, and I just had a question on the movie side so we can gauge that trend line. In the third quarter, TNT viewership was down a bit. I think -- it seemed to us that it was from the movie category, not the originals, those performed well. So first, is that right? And second, is the decline in movies due to a secular trend? Was that due to mix of movies? Was there more library, or just new movie avails is not as strong? I just want to make sure we're gauging that trend correctly.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "All right. I'll just do the movies first. There's not a secular trend really in movies. That passes around depending on which movies that you have on in a given quarter. In the -- if you're asking about TNT, there -- it gets into what avails of our series are on. We've had very strong performance in our original series on TNT. I think 4 out of the top 5, and a lot in the third quarter of our series on all cable were on TNT. So was your question about other parts of the programming or is it...", "John K. Martin", "Was it a cost question, Doug, or a strategy question? The cost piece is going down, and it's going to continue to go down as we move more money and reallocate it over to originals. Movies will still be an important part of the programming schedule, as Jeff said, because we got a lot of hours to fill 24/7 and they tend to be a little bit more economic, and some movies can still generate large audiences. But as we've said, we've made a strategic decision to back away from some of the real top heater movies and to go to more that you can play with repeat performances on more of an evergreen basis. But directionally, if you think of the 3 buckets of programming between sports, originals and acquired. Sports, obviously, huge importance, remain committed. We've got long-term deals with almost all of our sports partners. Originals are going to be going up and they're going to maintain a larger percent of the schedule. And then on the acquired side, emphasizing more the TV series and somewhat deemphasizing movies.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then Jeff and John, you both mentioned increasing confidence and strong Turner affiliate fee growth next year. Is that still specifically at the high single-digit level for domestic Turner that you expressed previously?", "John K. Martin", "Yes. I mean, for next year, we would anticipate it being close to double digits next year. Domestic affiliate fees at Turner, yes, same thing, no change.", "Operator", "Our next question online comes from Ms. Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have a couple of HBO questions. I guess, historic, you mentioned the Emmy wins, which were phenomenal. How do you benefit from that? Is it -- do you think it affects subscriber growth or is it in home video ultimately?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Jessica, it's a little indirect, but really important if you look at it over time. So if you have recognition, not just in Emmy's but also in press reviews, it allows you to take breakthrough programming that is not the kind of broad reach in every case, traditional ad-supported programming, and allow viewers to find it, and so you build these hits with subscribers that makes it efficient from a marketing point of view. It then does a very important thing, which is it attracts huge writer, director and actor talent that work in films to work in television. And what you've seen with HBO, starting it more than 10 years ago, is a very vibrant, creative kind of a highway between the film business and the television network business. And that has enlivened HBO and a lot of its competition. And what it does, it just brings -- because HBO gets first pick at a lot of these things, it brings a tremendous range and quality of projects that makes premium TV always more relevant, more powerful. And then to your question, that means it supports subscriber bases here and around the world, it supports content sales increasingly now in video and broadband. And so, the whole thing just picks up momentum, and that's essentially how it works.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just maybe moving overseas, which has obviously been a focus growth for you guys. I guess, can you just talk a little bit about how much more investment do you think you need to either just grow the business or buy out some partners? And also, maybe you could talk a little bit about where the upside -- you see upside in various regions? For example, I think you just launched in India. So any more color outside the U.S.?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes. Well, the main investments are behind us because we bought, as we said, the rest of the HBO networks in Europe and Asia and South America. And we have 1 partner who we've had all along in Latin America, and we're happy with that arrangement. So we don't need a lot of investment on the HBO side. When -- in turn, we're not buying things, we're just essentially expanding our programming, expanding our activities. We have launched in a few countries, as we referenced in the formal remarks, in Scandinavia and the Netherlands. We launched -- we're launching add-on services in India. We think that's a good market. But these things, by and large, don't take a lot of investment. They're basic line extensions. That's on the HBO side. On the Turner side, it's -- our strongest position is in Latin America. I think everyone knows we made a pretty good acquisition, 2 of them actually, the Claxson networks in Argentina, which are essentially Pan-Latin America basic networks across many genres, and then the Chilevision free-to-air network in Chile. And we're -- we can build on the Turner side in some countries with investments in terms of acquiring networks that may be there. But that -- it's not something where it's a clear -- put it this way, most of our investment, essentially, is in the operations, programming and expansion of what we have, not acquisition of other companies.", "John K. Martin", "And I think, Jessica, if your question was also -- in my remarks where I said that through the acquisition of Asia and South Asia, it would put somewhat of a drag on near-term earnings, if that's what the investment that you're referring to, that is true for fourth quarter. That, coupled with Nordic, means that the impact overall to Time Warner this year on an adjusted operating income basis is probably about $25 million, $30 million loss. I would expect that to improve beginning next year. In other words, Asia and South Asia, we would expect a crossover breakeven and actually contribute to earnings next year, and Nordic will probably be in and around comparable to this year. So it should get better beginning next year.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "We've been saying, and we still are, we're going to hit $1 billion in adjusted network operating income in the next couple of years. And we're still on track for that. That's a tremendous growth ramp for us.", "Operator", "Our next question online comes from Mr. Richard Greenfield from BTIG Research.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on Michael Nathanson's question. While you don't expect many people to take a broadband tier with broadcast as well as HBO, if it actually did take off, you have a lot of basic cable networks and then, obviously, that wouldn't be great for your basic cable net distribution. I'm just wondering from a technical standpoint, how big can Comcast, or -- forget about Comcast. How big could any MVPD make a tier, like what Comcast has just done, before that tier would have to get all of your basic channels? Essentially, at what point does the penetration have to hit before all of your big networks like TBS and TNT have to be part of what the consumer offering is? And then just a second, a quick question on CW. How important is the CW long-term to your company? We've got the Tribune, which is the #1 CW station group, has evolved into more of an entertainment company. I'm just curious how important wedded you are to that CW 50% stake?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Right. So Rich, we're not going to talk about our provisions and our contracts on our package requirements, but I mean, I know you're asking basically that. It's really something that we don't have to be concerned about on this near move. What -- let's just go to the likely facts. If there's viability and consumer attractiveness, which is the premise of your question, for people trying to get basically a more focused, a more valuable and maybe a less expensive basic cable package, our channels are going to be in there by consumer demand in order to make it happen. I mean, we have -- of all the network groups in the United States, we have the highest proportion of networks among the top 40. We also have the highest proportion of our affiliate fees from our biggest networks. About 85% of our fees come from our top 4. They're all basically wide reach, widely demanded networks. And so if you're going to have, to your question, any kind of really substantial take-up of a, let's call it a best of cable type of a package, our networks will be in there. If there was some -- if we were wrong about it, our contracts would handle that issue. So I'm not going to go more specific than that on it. If you go to the CW, it's been basically something where if you put the economics together of our show production and the network, it's a pretty valuable generator of asset value and income, even current income. So it's a good platform for the company, and it's been a significant part of our talent relations to create a working relationship with some of the younger talents that makes a lot of the cutting edge programming that goes not just to the CW, but it goes from Warner series production into the 5 broadcast nets and increasingly, into the cable networks who are buying more. And as you know, we not only supply TNT, TBS, truTV, we also have some critical shows in a lot of the other cable networks. So it's all, to our mind, it's been a very successful venture.", "Operator", "Our next question online comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a question on your leverage already being a bit below your target and expectations for continued very strong free cash flow. What are your priorities when we think about your balance sheet next year and your use of cash going forward? Can we see even a further acceleration to buy back?", "John K. Martin", "Yes. Look, thanks, Alexia, for the question. Our approach towards our capital structure and capital allocation, more broadly, has been pretty consistent now for the past 6 years since Jeff has been the CEO. And it's a balanced approach after fully investing in all of our organic investment projects. We look at 3 additional ways to provide value. The first is -- and this is in order of priority. The first is M&A, where we try to look for things on a disciplined way to advantage our existing competitive positions and grow value. And there, over the last 5 to 6 years, I think we've only spent about $3 billion in M&A, mostly in international cable. And that's not by design. That's just based on the attractiveness of the project, so you should probably think that there has been somewhat of a limited number of attractive targets that have presented themselves, but that may not necessarily hold into the future. The second is the dividend, which we've raised each of the last 4 years, double-digits on an annual basis. And the third is the buyback program, which we've been using very opportunistically and, frankly, we're quite pleased with the results and the allocation of capital there. And at a long-term target, leverage ratio of 2.5x, we think that today that optimizes the capital structure and minimizes the weighted average cost of capital, and appropriately balances our access to the capital markets at attractive pricing and at the same time, retain strategic flexibility. We'll always continue to evaluate that in terms of the right level, but we think 2.5x now still is right. And, yes, I mean, given the strong free cash flow generation that the company's had, it obviously increases our options for use of capital and use of cash. So...", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And just a follow-up on a comment that I think you made earlier about expecting some deceleration in international advertising growth in the fourth quarter. Is that simply a comp issue that you highlighted, or are you also -- are you seeing anything else there?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Look, let me -- international is up high-teens in the third quarter. If you didn't have a foreign exchange headwind, it would be up above 20%. And that included double-digit increases at both entertainment and news, particularly strong in Latin America. But we just don't see that kind of year-over-year trend continuing into the fourth quarter. Some of it is the result of -- that was pretty high ad growth from the third quarter benefiting from our Olympics comps in the third quarter. The secular dynamics are positive, particularly in emerging markets. And so, we feel very good about them on a long-term trajectory. They're just not going to be as high as that in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question online comes from Mr. John Janedis from UBS.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe sticking with the HBO theme, you guys talked about the moderation in subscription growth broadly. Are you seeing any kind of mixed shift at HBO? And what are some of the things you can do to reaccelerate domestic growth away from the renewal cycle you've spoken to?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, I'm not sure what you're talking about in terms of moderating. HBO's having a great year in domestic subscribers and a very huge year overseas as well. If you're asking about the mix, sometimes our sub-growth, depending on the affiliate, is weighted towards either Cinemax subs or basically incentive subscribers that are over and above the penetration targets we have in our deals. What happens with those is they end up creating a subbase that becomes a very strong platform for HBO's partnership with the distributor as they work out wholesale rates and penetration and marketing plans into the next year. So HBO is doing -- having, I guess -- well, actually, I think it's the strongest year in domestic subs in many years this year.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. So no change in trend?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, the trend in domestic sub-growth is up, so the change is an increase.", "Operator", "Our next question online comes from Mr. Michael Morris from Guggenheim Partners.", "Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Two topics. First, just back on the investment in HBO internationally. Can you help us with just the size of that business? Can you share the revenue that's generated by the Asian assets that you acquired? And also, if you look at that relative to the size of the Latin America business that you don't currently consolidate, how much bigger is Latin America than Asia, and how do you think about -- where are you in the potential of being able to have a similar transaction for Latin America? And then I have one follow-up on CETV.", "John K. Martin", "Mike, it's John. I don't have the break out of the international HBO investments in front of me. We can do that offline. I mean, overall, regardless of the accounting, HBO is about $1 billion of revenue. Internationally, Latin America is the single-largest asset. Whether that's 30% or 40%, I just don't know off the top of my head. It's been growing the fastest still. And as far as the ability to buy out the partner, I think we own 89% of HBO Latin America today. And the reason why we don't consolidate has to do more with certain governance rights as compared to ownership. So I think in terms of the operational management, day-to-day control, the HBO management team has been exercising that now for some time, and it's one of the reasons why the assets have been performing so well.", "Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on CETV, it seems that you're expecting about a $0.05 drag in the fourth quarter. I believe just based on what you've done year-to-date there, is that accurate? And then is that based on expectation just for the financial performance of that business going forward? Or is there something -- what I'm trying to figure out is as I look forward, whether that includes any sort of incremental loss or cost, or whether that's sort of indicative of the run rate of what you're seeing at that business.", "John K. Martin", "I'm not sure what your question means, Mike. I mean, we do straight equity accounting on CETV, and we recognize 49.9% of their net operations. So year-to-date, through the 9 months, it's been about an $0.08 drag this year versus a $0.04 drag last year. Looking at the fourth quarter, based on their public guidance, it would be about another $0.02. So we're anticipating about a total $0.10 drag this year versus $0.04 last year. So that is what I've mentioned.", "Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So $0.02 in the fourth quarter, and it's all simply just operating results from the company. There's nothing else...", "John K. Martin", "Based on the company's public guidance, that's correct.", "Operator", "Our last question online comes from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne Agee.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "My question is on CNN, John. I think a year or 2 ago, the conventional wisdom was that no matter what the ratings are doing, the network is still a steady contributor to adjusted operating income. But given that you're mentioning incremental investment in programming there, my question is, one, is the network operating income down year-on-year so far in 2013? And then, how should we on the outside be judging the progress at CNN outside of ratings, perhaps?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Wait. Can you just -- are you talking about CNN?", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Yes, CNN.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. The ratings are up.", "John K. Martin", "You want me to do the financials and then you go ahead on the strategy? And...", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, yes.", "John K. Martin", "So, look, financially, we don't break out network by network our financials. I will tell you, directionally, CNN's operating income this year is down. And that's because of proactive decisions that have been made by Jeff Zucker and the new team there to try to invest in the programming in many, many day parts, and you're seeing the benefits of that show up often in the ratings. Those are active decisions made by management as opposed to having it done to them. And going forward, we're going to continue to evaluate what the right level of investment is for CNN. I mean, the expectation is going to be, on a multi-year basis, this thing is going to go back to growth, absolutely.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, it's not a trend.", "John K. Martin", "Yes. It's not a sustainable trend.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "So let me add, it's still early, but the moves that we've had, and you can see them on air and you can see them in the ratings, is that the new leadership in light of the new programming lineup moves are off to a great start, the morning shows, some of the prime time shows, up considerably. If you look at the breaking news events this year, it's been very evident that CNN has been the leader both in ratings and quality. And at the same time, as John had said, and I think you just said it again, we're broadening the per view of coverage to keep viewers tuning in during slower news cycles to cover some areas of cultural and specific events that are of interest to people of all ages. That's the kind of thing you'd see with some of our new morning show segments, with some of Anthony Bourdain's shows, and some other shows we've put on. We've also added some news analysis with the Crossfire rebirth, and we're going to be investing more both in talent and shows to get that done. So we just think that this is a good time to capitalize, really, on the position CNN has. Nobody is saying enough and we should make sure we're not guilty of this. We're not any of us focusing enough on digital. Digital is a huge part of the future of news. CNN is the world leader in digital. If we are talking about any other programming genre, everyone would be all over the digital store. News, they should be even more focused on that. That's another key focus for CNN. It's a major area of strength for the company both here, against its domestic rivals, that leads pretty strongly in online news and globally. And so that's part of the reason why we're investing.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Vasily, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. As always, we're available for any follow-ups.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Time Warner. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call.", "This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full year and the other providing our 2014 full year business outlook, which excludes Time Inc.", "Before we begin, there are 3 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.", "Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "And lastly, in the fourth quarter, the company separated its former network's reportable segment into 2 reportable segments: Turner and Home Box Office.", "In addition, during the fourth quarter, the company changed the name of its Film and TV Entertainment reportable segment to Warner Bros., and its publishing reportable segment to Time Inc. The new presentation had no impact on the historical consolidated financial information previously reported by the company.", "Thank you, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. 2013 was another very successful year for the company. We grew adjusted operating income 8%, adjusted earnings per share increased 16%, we generated over $3.5 billion in free cash flow, and we returned almost $5 billion to stockholders through buybacks and dividends.", "These accomplishments were the result of a strategy that served us very well, not just last year, but for the past 5 years.", "Between 2008 and 2013, we grew adjusted operating income at close to a double-digit compound annual growth rate, and we turned that into average annual growth and adjusted EPS of more than 20% a year.", "We've achieved that through a combination of solid revenue growth, tight cost control and disciplined capital allocation.", "In fact, over that period, we allocated nearly $20 billion to dividends and share repurchases.", "As we announced this morning, we anticipate another year of double-digit growth and adjusted EPS, excluding Time Inc., in 2014. And we're committed to continue providing direct returns to stockholders, as evidenced by the new $5 billion share repurchase authorization and 10% increase in our dividend approved by our board. That marks the fifth straight year we've increased our dividend double-digits.", "The consistency of our performance over the last few years is a result of our unwavering focus on the same key objectives that we've been talking to you about for quite a while.", "First and foremost, we're investing aggressively in the best content. Second, we're focused on harnessing technology and developing new business models to increase the value of our content to consumers and distributors and drive growth for our businesses. Third, we're increasing our presence in the most attractive international territories to take advantage of growing demand for our content outside the United States. And fourth, we're constantly striving to optimize our operating and capital efficiency to drive improved returns.", "So let me briefly talk about the progress we made on each of those objectives in 2013 and how we have positioned ourselves for success in 2014 and beyond.", "I'll start with our investment in great content and storytelling, the heart of what we do.", "At Turner, we're significantly increasing our investments in programming, particularly in originals, to keep our networks at the very top of the industry.", "TBS finished 2013 as the #1 cable network in prime time in adults 18 to 49 for the first time in over a decade.", "The Big Bang Theory remains a big part of that success and was once again the #1 comedy on ad-supported cable.", "But TBS has also been building a strong stable of original hits, with Cougar Town, Ground Floor, Sullivan & Son and Men at Work, all among the top 10 original sitcoms on ad-supported cable this year.", "And while TNT has hit a bit of a soft patch the past few months, it still finished 2013 as the #2 cable network among adults 25 to 54 in total day, and #4 in prime time among adults 18 to 49.", "Four of TNT's hit shows, Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes, Falling Skies and Perception, were among the top 15 originals in prime time on basic cable. That's more top hits than any other basic cable network.", "In 2014, TBS and TNT are going to increase their investment in high-quality originals by approximately 20%, including some high-profile new launches from TNT later this year: The Last Ship, Legends and Murder in the First.", "Turner is also raising its game in high-profile sports. Our March Madness coverage will include Elite Eight and Final Four games for the first time this year. That bolsters a strong lineup of sports that already includes the NBA and Major League Baseball.", "Adult Swim is also on a roll. It had its highest viewership ever in 2013, growing its total day audience double-digits in audience 18 to 34, and finishing as the #1 cable network in that demo for the ninth straight year.", "As Adult Swim has grown in popularity, we've continued to expand its programming hours. And in April, we're going to add another, expanding it to the 8 p.m. hour.", "In 2013, CNN overtook MSNBC as the #2 cable news network in total day viewership.", "But we still have a lot of work to do. In 2014, CNN is focused on remaining the place where viewers turn for breaking news, revamping prime time, broadening the programming schedule to better hold audiences during slower news cycles, and extending its leadership in multi-platform news.", "truTV had a dip in its performance in 2013, but it remained a top 20 basic cable network among men, and we have a lot of confidence in the direction new leadership is taking it. We think there's significant opportunity to both grow audience and better monetize its position as we refresh tru's programming in the second half of this year.", "The strength of Turner's brands and success of our programming strategy have been reflected in our recent affiliate negotiations.", "Since we last reported earnings, we've signed 3 additional top 10 U.S. distributors to long-term affiliate agreements. That means that during this negotiating cycle, we have now signed 7 of the top 10 distributors including 2 of the top 5.", "All these deals have been consistent with our expectation that Turner will average double-digit growth in domestic subscription revenue over the next 3 years. You will start to see the impact of many of those deals in the first quarter, and given our progress to date, we now have even more confidence in that multi-year outlook.", "Now speaking of high-quality, high-impact programming, HBO remains in a league of its own. This year, HBO won 27 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most of any network for the 12th year in a row, and tied for the most Golden Globes of any network.", "HBO's value to its viewers and distribution partners was evident in the continued growth in its subscriber base.", "Last year, HBO added almost 2 million subscribers in the U.S., its highest increase in 17 years. That included solid growth across both HBO and Cinemax.", "HBO is going to up the ante again in 2014, increasing its original series hours and investment in original programming. That includes returning hits like Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, True Blood and Girls, as well as 5 new series. One of those, True Detective, is already looking like it will be one of HBO's biggest hits. It premiered to critical acclaim last month, and the cumulative audience for its first episode has already passed 10 million [ph] viewers.", "We're also excited about The Leftovers, a Warner Bros. show from Damon Lindelof, which debuts in June and could be the next big hit for HBO.", "Now let's turn to Warner Bros. It had a banner year creatively and commercially in film and television production, leading the industry by practically any measure and recording the highest profits in its history.", "Theatrically, Warner Bros. led both domestic and international box offices, crossing $5 billion in global box office for the first time in its history. That included 7 movies with more than $300 million in global box office, led by hits such as the second installment of The Hobbit, Gravity and Man of Steel.", "Warner Bros. films also received an industry-leading 21 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture nominations for Gravity and for Her.", "In 2014, we had another strong slate, led by titles like the Lego Movie, which opens this Friday; Edge of Tomorrow, starring Tom Cruise; Jupiter Ascending, from the Wachowskis; Godzilla; Christopher Nolan's Interstellar; and the final installment of The Hobbit.", "In television production, Warner Bros. was also unrivaled in 2013. Over the course of this TV season, Warner's will have produced 32 shows for broadcast networks, again more than any other studio.", "Among adults 18 to 49, these shows include the #1 comedy in The Big Bang Theory, the #1 unscripted show in The Voice, and the #3 drama in The Following. And including our production for cable networks, Warner TV is producing over 60 shows in total this season.", "Let me turn to our second area of strategic focus, digital. Our goal is to give consumers more ways to access our content on more platforms. That will increase the value of our content to consumers, bolster our existing businesses and open up additional opportunities for monetization.", "For example, Turner continues to lead in providing TV Everywhere rights to its distribution partners. This last year, Turner expanded its TV Everywhere offering to include live streaming of its networks in and out of the home. And Turner is now working to provide modem-based authentication for TV Everywhere, reducing the need for people to sign in.", "As we've said in the past, we think distributors need to accelerate the deployment of TV Everywhere capabilities, invest in better consumer interfaces and simplify authentication. Those will be key areas of focus for us in this year, 2014.", "Turner's digital efforts aren't limited to TV Everywhere. For instance, Bleacher Report grew its monthly unique visitors by almost 40% in 2013 and ended the year as a top 3 digital sports destination.", "And CNN remained the #1 multi-platform provider of news in the U.S., significantly outstripping its cable news peers and leading the industry, the news industry, in mobile users.", "HBO continues to set the standard for the industry with its TV Everywhere apps, HBO GO and MAX GO.", "In 2013, active users of HBO GO grew over 30% and average monthly usage increased by double digits. HBO GO is now available in 23 countries outside the U.S. as well. And HBO will be investing even more this year to make the HBO GO user experience even better.", "In home entertainment, Warner Bros. is also making progress in improving the user experience for its digital products. One of the most important initiatives on that front is UltraViolet, the industry standard designed to make it easier for consumers to access their content on multiple platforms.", "UltraViolet ended 2013 with more than 15 million accounts. That's a 65% increase from the end of 2012. Awareness still needs to improve, but the consumers who use UltraViolet love it. And we think more and more consumers will enjoy its benefits as retail support continues to increase.", "You can see the impact that improving experience is having on consumer behavior in almost 50% growth in electronic sales for the industry last year. That helped drive an increase in domestic consumer spending on home entertainment for the first time in 8 years.", "With UltraViolet now available in 9 countries outside the U.S. and plans to expand further, we're hopeful we'll also see stabilization in international home video revenue over the next few years. That's a perfect segue to our third strategic objective, which is international growth.", "Including HBO's unconsolidated ventures, we generated nearly $10 billion in revenue outside the U.S. in 2013. That's 1/3 of our revenue. We think there is a big opportunity to grow this over time, given the increase in multi-channel TV penetration, the expansion of premium and SVOD services into new territories and growth in theatrical screens in emerging markets.", "And our biggest international business is at Warner Bros., which generates nearly half its revenue from outside the U.S.", "In 2013, Warner's grossed over $3 billion at the international box office, with 10 movies grossing more than $100 million.", "Warner's also continues to expand its international TV business, with revenue approaching $1.5 billion in 2013.", "Perhaps our biggest international opportunity is at our international networks. Including HBO's unconsolidated joint ventures, our international networks generated more than $3 billion in revenues and over $750 million in adjusted operating income in 2013.", "Despite a continued drag from foreign exchange, we're on track to take that to $1 billion in the next couple of years.", "We're seeing particularly strong growth in Latin America, where Turner grew its revenues double-digits and grew its profits by over 25%.", "Latin America is also a source of strong growth for HBO, which helped drive its international subscriber base up over 15% in 2013 to end the year with 84 million HBO subs outside the United States. That means HBO ended the year with almost 130 million subs globally.", "As we make these investments in content, technology and international expansion, our fourth objective is to improve our efficiency to help fund them.", "To that end, we announced last month the sale of our office space at Columbus Circle in New York. Our intention is to relocate our headquarters and all our New York City-based operations to a new tower in the Hudson Yards development on the West Side of Manhattan, beginning in late 2018.", "That would include approximately 5,000 employees from across Time Warner Corporate, HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. Moving into a dynamic new complex will foster even more collaboration and creativity across our businesses. And by consolidating space from 7 buildings throughout the Metro area, we'll be able to reallocate substantial savings to our primary business of creating valuable and engaging content for audiences around the world.", "We're also pleased with the progress Time Inc.'s new management team is making in its preparations to become an independent publicly traded company, and we remain on track to complete the spinoff in the second quarter of this year.", "In closing, we had a tremendous year in 2013. We posted record financial results while investing aggressively for the future. We also put in place the next generation of leaders, with new CEOs at each of our divisions. And with the decision to spin off Time Inc., we set ourselves on a path to being a pure-play content company, with an emphasis on video and television in particular.", "So we're embarked on an exciting new phase for the company, and with our strong brands, leading scale and focused strategy, I'm more confident than ever in our prospects to drive attractive growth in 2014 and for many years to come.", "With that, I want to turn it over to Howard for his first earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. Take it away, Howard.", "Howard M. Averill", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.", "As Mike noted, we're breaking out HBO and Turner for the first time with these results. As we become a smaller, more TV-focused company, we hope you will find the new presentation helpful.", "Starting with consolidated results. As Jeff discussed, we had another great year in 2013, with revenues up 4%, adjusted operating income up 8%, and adjusted EPS up 16%.", "Turner, HBO and Warner Bros. all posted record adjusted operating income. And if you exclude Time Inc., adjusted OI grew over 9%, and adjusted EPS grew 19%.", "We were able to achieve all that despite a slight dip in adjusted OI in the fourth quarter. And that was largely related to the impairment of programming at Turner, as well as the timing of programming and related marketing spending at Turner and HBO.", "Even so, we limited expense growth to 3% this year and drove margins up almost 100 basis points, our fifth straight year of margin expansion.", "Over those 5 years, margins have increased over 600 basis points. We remain intensely focused on managing our cost structure in order to free up resources to invest even more in our businesses. And we expect that focus will allow us to continue to grow margins over the next several years.", "Adjusted EPS was up slightly in the quarter and 16% for the year, our fifth straight year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. And that was despite a drag on this year's earnings due to equity losses from CME.", "Along with our strong full year operating performance, growth benefited from a lower effective tax rate and $3.7 billion in share repurchases.", "So combining our repurchases with $1.1 billion in dividends, we returned almost $5 billion to stockholders in 2013. This is an increase of more than 10% year-over-year and exceeded our free cash flow by more than 35%.", "And as evidenced by the dividend increase and new repurchase authorization we announced this morning, we remain committed to delivering significant direct returns to shareholders.", "So we're really pleased with our performance in 2013, and we feel great about how we are positioned going into 2014 and beyond.", "As you saw this morning, for the first time, we are providing a full year outlook for the company, excluding Time Inc. Following a spinoff, which we expect will occur in the second quarter, Time Inc. will be reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and will no longer be reflected in our adjusted EPS.", "Excluding Time Inc., we anticipate another year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. I'll provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation.", "Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where we achieved record adjusted operating income for the year despite a slight decline in the fourth quarter. Advertising revenues grew 5% for the year and a modest 1% in the quarter, a little lighter than we had originally expected. And that was due to a combination of softer-than-expected ratings and a weak scatter market in November.", "Domestic advertising was flat in the quarter. That included mid-single-digit growth at the entertainment networks, including kids and young adults. Domestic news declined double-digits in the quarter, owing to the comparison against the 2012 U.S. presidential election and ongoing softness in the news advertising marketplace.", "International advertising was up modestly in the quarter. That reflected healthy growth in Latin America, while performance was softer elsewhere, particularly in Asia and international news.", "Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2014, we anticipate total advertising to grow in the mid- to high-single-digits. Scatter pricing is up high-single to low double-digits over the upfront, though ratings will likely remain somewhat of a drag on our performance.", "Also keep in mind that we will be airing 2 NCAA Elite Eight games, which we expect to provide a boost of around 200 to 300 basis points to total ad growth in the quarter.", "Similarly, second quarter ad growth will benefit by around 300 to 400 basis points from the airing of 2 Final Four games. That revenue will come with additional expenses, such that the net impact will probably be a slight drag on adjusted OI.", "Moving on. Subscription revenues were up 6% in the quarter and 5% for the year, and that included an FX drag of approximately 100 basis points for both periods.", "Excluding the impact of FX, international Subscription revenue grew double-digits in both the fourth quarter and for the year, and Latin America was once again our strongest region.", "As we look forward, we should start to see the benefits of Turner's domestic affiliate renewals in the first quarter. We also continue to see healthy subscriber dynamics in international territories, though FX headwinds remain a drag there.", "Taken together, we anticipate an acceleration in our Subscription revenue growth into the high single-digits.", "Adjusted operating income was up 6% for the year, but down 3% in the quarter. The decline in the fourth quarter was a result of a significant increase in programming expenses, which grew 12%. That growth included around $70 million of programming impairments related to our decision to stop airing certain programming due to its poor performance. We also significantly increased our investment in original programming and related marketing spend at our domestic networks in the quarter.", "Even with the ramp-up in programming and marketing spend in the fourth quarter, for the year, programming expenses were up just 6%, and we limited total expense growth to 4%. And we were able to do that by keeping SG&A essentially flat, reflecting our continued commitment to tightly managing overhead costs.", "So all in all, we had another good year at Turner. Excluding programming impairments, adjusted operating income would have grown about 8% for the year and margins would have expanded over 100 basis points. And we think we're in great position to grow at attractive levels in 2014 and beyond.", "Moving on to HBO. We had another year of healthy margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up 8% in the quarter and 6% for the year. And the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributed around 400 basis points to the growth in the quarter, and approximately 100 basis points for the year.", "Domestically, we had relatively steady Subscription revenue growth throughout the year. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO and Cinemax, together, added almost 2 million domestic subscribers in 2013.", "Keep in mind, the majority of these subscriber additions are non-revenue-generating. Still, the subscriber gains reflect very healthy demand for HBO. So as we look ahead, we feel good about the trajectory of Subscription revenues.", "Turning to content revenues. We saw a 9% drop in the quarter, and that was mostly due to soft demand for home video library product. However, we continue to see very healthy demand for the licensing of our content internationally, and these revenues were up solidly for the year.", "HBO has been investing significant resources in its international operations in recent years, and including HBO's unconsolidated joint ventures, international accounted for approximately 1/4 of HBO's total revenue in 2013. That was helped by solid double-digit growth in subscribers, with particularly strong growth in Latin America.", "Given positive trends, we anticipate that international will be an even larger portion of HBO's future -- business in the future.", "Adjusted operating income was down 4% in the quarter, but would have been flat without the consolidation of HBO's international properties I noted earlier.", "On the cost side, programming expenses grew 12%, with HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributing nearly 800 basis points to that growth.", "Increased spending on originals also contributed to programming expense growth, and we ramped up marketing spend in the quarter to support our original programming lineup, including high-profile first quarter launches, such as True Detective.", "Despite the drop in the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income grew 8% for the year, and margins expanded 130 basis points. So we had another good year financially while growing our subscribers significantly, both in the U.S. and internationally. And that gives us a lot of confidence about the opportunity for continued attractive growth in the years ahead.", "Turning now to Warner's, where the studio ended a record year with a record quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 4% in the quarter and 7% for the year to over $1.3 billion. Theatrically, we had a tremendous year, ending #1 at both the domestic and international box office. Our fourth quarter theatrical results were highlighted by the strong performances of Gravity and the second installment of The Hobbit.", "On the TV side, revenue and associated profits were down for the year, in part due to the comparisons against the syndication of The Mentalist in 2012. But Warner's remained the industry leader in shows produced for broadcast networks, and we continue to see healthy demand for our content, both domestically and internationally.", "So TV production remained the largest contributor to the segment, and we feel good about the trends here.", "The performance of our video games slate was also a meaningful contributor to growth this year, led by the fourth quarter release of Batman: Arkham Origins and continued strong results of the LEGO franchise.", "This is an area where we have been able to leverage our brands and IP to develop new franchises and where we see the opportunity for further growth in the coming years.", "Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 6% in the quarter and 3% for the year. Both of those included a pretty tough comparison to the release of The Dark Knight Rises in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "In addition, we have seen some softness in catalog. However, we're seeing very positive trends in digital across both theatrical and television product, with electronic sell-through up over 50% in the quarter and over 40% for the year. That mirrors trends in the broader industry, as initiatives like UV that we have championed are starting to have a significant impact. After 8 years of declines in total consumer spending, the industry grew 1% in 2013. That's a reflection of digital revenue growing fast enough to make up for physical declines. For context, Warner Bros. digital revenue for theatrical and TV product grew double-digits to almost $1 billion in 2013, and we expect it to grow double-digits again in 2014.", "Putting it altogether, Warner's had another great year and once again set a high bar for itself. In what is often referred to as a mature business, Warner's has managed to grow its adjusted operating income at a 10% CAGR over the past 5 years. And while that won't be achievable every year, we have great confidence in our ability to continue to grow the business over time.", "Now on to Time Inc., where challenging conditions continued to weigh on results for both the quarter and the year.", "Revenue in the quarter included the positive impact of the inclusion of American Express Publishing Corporation, which we acquired in October, and the negative impact from the shift of an issue of both People and Sports Illustrated into the third quarter.", "Excluding these items, revenues would have declined 6% in the quarter, with advertising down 5%, subscription down 8%, and other down 4%.", "The underlying drop in advertising revenue reflected softness in print advertising, both domestically and internationally. Digital advertising revenue was up modestly for both the quarter and the year.", "Similarly, subscription revenues included the impact of declines across both domestic and international titles, with newsstand remaining an area of particular softness.", "Adjusted operating income declined 14% in the quarter, despite a drop in expenses when excluding the American Express Publishing titles.", "Looking ahead to 2014, the operating environment remains challenging. So excluding the impact of our acquisition of American Express Publishing Corporation, we anticipate continued declines in advertising and circulation revenues.", "Within that context, the new management team announced yesterday that they are beginning a process to make significant changes to the way Time Inc. operates, with a goal of stabilizing the business and freeing up resources to invest in growth initiatives.", "As part of their efforts to reengineer the company, Time Inc. will dissolve their operating clusters to help make them flatter, more nimble, and better able to respond to a rapidly changing landscape. To that end, we anticipate taking restructuring charges of around $150 million in the first half, around 2/3 of which we expect to hit in the first quarter.", "Excluding restructuring charges, we expect modest declines in adjusted operating income, both in the first quarter and for the full year. And that's largely a function of continuing revenue pressure and incremental public company and stock compensation expenses that Time Inc. will incur this year. They'll have more to say about their plans as we get closer to the spinoff.", "One important decision we made is Time Inc.'s capital structure. While there could be some minor adjustments for working capital, we intend to spin off Time Inc. with a net debt of around $1.3 billion. We think that level will allow sufficient flexibility to both invest in the business and provide direct returns to stockholders, while also optimizing its cost of capital and delivering attractive levered equity returns to investors.", "Moving on to the next slide, which shows our outlook, excluding Time Inc., for 2014. As I noted before, we had another great year in 2013, and we feel very good about how we are positioned for this year.", "At Turner, we'll benefit from the domestic affiliate renewal cycle, which should drive a nice improvement in Subscription revenue growth. At the same time, we're expecting an increase in programming expense growth, primarily due to the airing of the NCAA Final Four, the first year of our new Major League Baseball contract, and increased investments in originals. And while international growth remains a positive driver, at this point, FX appears likely to remain a drag.", "Taken all together, we anticipate Turner's adjusted OI growth will accelerate significantly in 2014.", "At HBO, we're encouraged by the continued strength and demand for our services, and that should help Subscription revenue growth. That will be balanced against an increase in programming expense growth related to continued investment in originals and the addition of a full slate of Summit films to our theatrical line up.", "We'll also be investing even more in technology as we develop the next generation of HBO GO. Even with these investments, we're anticipating another year of solid growth in adjusted operating income.", "At Warner Bros., we obviously have very challenging comparisons coming off a record year. So it could be difficult to grow. But we think we have a great film slate, and we anticipate an improvement in TV performance given strong global demand and the syndication of Mike & Molly. That all gives us confidence that 2014 will be another great year for the studio.", "So looking across all 3 segments, we're set up for a very good year from an operating perspective. One thing to keep in mind is that intercompany eliminations are likely to be somewhat of a drag this year due to increased sales of product from Warner Bros. to both Turner and HBO. That's a pretty big shift from 2013 when we benefited from a positive swing in this line.", "We also anticipate a higher effective tax rate, as our 2013 rate included several favorable audit settlements and the recognition of additional foreign tax credit carryovers. So between a swing in eliminations and the higher effective tax rate, we estimate the impact on 2014 adjusted EPS to be $0.15 to $0.20.", "Despite that, we expect another very good year in 2014. We see a tremendous amount of opportunity across our businesses, and we're investing aggressively in our industry-leading brands to drive increased scale and long-term growth.", "At the same time, we're tightly managing our non-revenue-generating expenses in order to provide attractive near- to medium-term financial results. All of that is reflected in our outlook for low double-digit growth in adjusted EPS.", "Turning to the next slide, which looks at our free cash flow. We generated very strong free cash flow of $3.5 billion in 2013. That's up almost 20% versus 2012, and that was mostly due to strong growth in adjusted operating income.", "Also, cash taxes, cash interest and capital expenditures were all lower year-over-year.", "The decline in cash taxes was primarily a result of tax law extenders that were passed by Congress in January of 2013. That's been a positive driver all year. And the decline in cash interest was largely due to slightly lower cost of debt and debt balances as we paid off higher cost maturities early in the year and eventually replaced them with longer-term maturities in the fourth quarter.", "Our use of working capital increased slightly as a result of higher participations at Warner Bros.", "Excluding Time Inc., we generated around $3.1 billion of free cash flow in 2013.", "For 2014, keep in mind that as a result of the expiration of certain favorable tax legislation and lower foreign tax credits, our cash taxes are likely to be higher.", "In addition, we're now carrying additional debt, which will result in increased cash interest expense. Still, we should have another year of very strong free cash flow.", "Turning to the final slide, which looks at our net debt. We ended 2013 with $18.3 billion of net debt, and our leverage ratio was 2.4x.", "During the year, we took advantage of continued favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by extending the maturity of our $5 billion credit facilities to 2018 and issuing $1 billion of new long-term debt.", "In addition to investing in our businesses, we deployed just under $500 million in strategic M&A transactions.", "Also, as I previously mentioned, we returned almost $5 billion of capital to our stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "And as Jeff discussed earlier, we recently sold our office space in Time Warner Center and intend to relocate our corporate headquarters to the Hudson Yards development at the end of 2018. That will result in a net inflow of around $1.1 billion in 2014.", "Over time, we will essentially reinvest the proceeds into our new building. And until we move, we will lease space in Time Warner Center. The transaction will have a negligible impact on our earnings over the next few years, but we expect significant savings when we ultimately consolidate our New York City footprint at our new headquarters.", "So I am pleased with how we executed in our capital plan in 2013, and we're off to a good start in 2014. As part of our planning for 2014 and beyond, we have decided to increase our net leverage ratio target from 2.5x to up to 2.75x, with the expectation that we will get there over the next 2 years.", "In part, this decision is a reflection that after the Time Inc. spinoff, we will have a less cyclical business mix with better secular trends. We think modestly increasing our leverage will lower our blended cost of capital while affording us additional flexibility that we can use to make investments in our businesses and to continue providing a significant level of direct returns to our stockholders.", "At the same time, we believe it will allow us to maintain favorable access to the capital markets across a variety of potential macroeconomic scenarios. We do not anticipate the change will have an impact on our credit ratings, and we remain committed to maintaining solid investment-grade credit ratings moving forward.", "In that context, I want to take a moment to discuss our capital allocation priorities, which are not changing. Our first priority is always to maintain a strong balance sheet so that we can fully invest in our businesses. Next, we always look at M&A opportunities that present themselves, but we have sufficient scale, so we don't need to do anything.", "Potential transactions need to provide strategic benefits with reasonable execution risk and adequate financial return. That means risk-adjusted returns need to be more attractive than other uses of capital, including share repurchases.", "Beyond that, we are committed to providing meaningful direct returns to stockholders, with a significant and growing dividend and continued share repurchases.", "If you look back over the last 5 years, you'll see what that approach has yielded. Since 2008, we have generated close to $15 billion in free cash flow, and we paid out close to $5 billion in dividends, repurchased close to $15 billion of our shares or 32% of our base. And we spent around $3 billion on acquisitions. And we've been able to do that while maintaining our credit ratings and retaining the ability to access capital markets on attractive terms.", "So we feel good about our approach and intend to continue on a similar path moving forward.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Howard. Joe, can you please open up the queue for Q&A? [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question here is from Mr. Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "I have one for Howard and one for Jeff. And Howard, welcome to the job. Before John left, John had signaled that programming costs in '14 at the networks would run, I think, in the high single-digit range. And now that you have separated out HBO and Turner, I wonder if you could help fine-tune that growth rate by division for '14?", "Howard M. Averill", "Michael, thank you. Yes, you're right. For context, we had actually set expectations for mid- to high-single-digit in programming costs in the network segment level. And that hasn't actually changed. But when you translate it to our current segments, it's going to translate to more like high single-digit growth at Turner and mid single-digit growth at HBO. And the faster growth at Turner is really basically driven by sports. So for example, if you took a look this year, we're going to have the first year of our baseball deal and the first year we're going to be airing Elite Eight games and Final Four games. So if you look ahead, also to 2016 and 2017, we're going to anticipate an increase based on the NBA package. But all of this is consistent with what we've talked about in the past. And Mike, we think by continuing to drive the revenue growth and tightly managing the rest of our costs, we're going to be in a position to continue to drive margins at both Turner and HBO.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay. And then let me ask one for Jeff. This is a bit about TNT strategy. In the past couple of weeks, we've seen 3 off-network procedural dramas, Person of Interest, Elementary, Blue Bloods, that may have worked in the past on TNT, go someplace else in cable. And I wondered, the decision not to acquire those shows. What does that say about either procedurals, your pipeline or kind of -- or the value of the shows? So typically, you guys have acquired procedurals and this time, you didn't. And so what's behind that strategy?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. Thanks. We still think that the mix of sports, originals and acquired shows is the right strategy. And just to your question, if you look at the data out there, 5 of the top 10 scripted shows on broadcast in the '13 to '14 season are procedurals. And 2 of the top 5 cable networks in prime time last year had significant numbers of procedurals. So the evidence suggests that consumers still have a strong appetite for procedurals. And remember, they are still quite important to filling the programming day and to helping build a schedule on which you can then launch originals. But we're expanding TNT into more serialized and unscripted series. So you can expect the mix to shift a little bit on procedurals, but the value of procedurals and their place, whether on broadcast or cable, continues to be there. And you could certainly see hit procedurals coming that are going up instead of down in terms of the audience and interest that they drive. We'll probably be a little more selective on them going forward for TNT. But, in general, it's really an evolution of the mix, and the basics pretty much -- well, as a strong point for TNT, pretty much remain.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mr. Richard Greenfield from BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "On Netflix's earnings interview, Reed Hastings stated that the addressable market for Netflix was somewhere in the range of 60 million to 90 million subscribers domestically, well above the 33 million subs they're currently at. I'm curious. You talked about total subscribers, I think that includes HBO and Cinemax. Where did HBO end the year specifically in terms of domestic subscribers? And how do you think about growth as you look out over the next several years between subscriber growth and affiliate fee increases? And then just a tack-on question because I think it relates to the margin. You've been investing pretty heavily in Cinemax. I know you don't break out profitability, but is there any way to think about, as you're investing in shows like Banshee and new projects, how much is that 37% EBITDA margin on the HBO division weighed down by that ramp-up in Cinemax?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Okay. Thanks, Rich. Let's go to the first one on HBO and Cinemax. Well, first of all, both of them were up. HBO subs are about 2/3 of the total. In total, HBO and Cinemax together, we added 2 million subs last year. We ended the year with over 43 million domestic subs. And remember, we also have 85 million-or-so overseas, up quite a bit last year, so 130 million worldwide. If you look at the investments in programming, and I'll take Cinemax in a second, I like to start a little bit at HBO. We definitely think, and we're doing it, that we can grow the sub base on both of them, both domestically and overseas. You can see the result of those investments in programming in the sub growth we've had in the last couple of years. HBO still commands very attractive rate increases, a very important part of what cable, telco, satellite companies offer every month. And we have a pretty controllable cost base, and I'll get to the Cinemax question. So we do expect continued healthy growth in adjusted operating income as we've been doing. That's -- and that's if you add international to that, with really fast sub growth, it gets even better. International's over 15% in 2013, and that was after an increase of more than 35% in '12 and 25% in '11. As we've been saying, we've been launching new territories like the Netherlands for HBO Nordic, and India, and we do think those provide additional growth opportunities for the brand overseas. We also, and you shouldn't forget this, license our HBO content in about 150 countries. That's on top of all the international subs. And the demand there for HBO programs is really helping. So -- and if you put that all together, a pretty healthy opportunity for HBO going forward. To your Cinemax question, this is, what are we doing on programming? We think Cinemax is an underappreciated asset. In 2013, we actually had more viewing at Cinemax than at Starz and basically, the same viewing at Cinemax as at Showtime. It's very profitable for us, but it's even more important for our distribution partners as a companion brand to HBO. We think there's an opportunity to make Cinemax, with all that reach and viewership, stronger. And original programming clearly becomes more important to premium customers as VOD gets more used both on TV and on Internet devices. So we are going to invest in original programming. It's quite economical with Cinemax. We had a big success with the third season of Strike Back. It averaged over 2.75 million viewers. The second season of Banshee did over 2.5 million viewers. That's on a base of -- well, I'm not going to give you that one, but this year, we're going to be launching The Knick. Stay tuned, everybody, for that. We're going to add more series in the future. But to your margin question, we really run HBO and Cinemax together. And on that basis, we have been and we will be growing margins over time. And we think the Cinemax investment in programming is a pretty good leverage point for revenue growth at Cinemax and at HBO.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "And just as a point of clarification, when you said international up over 15% in HBO subscribers, does that exclude the consolidations, like is that an organic growth rate for international subscribers?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "You guys talked a couple of times in the prepared remarks about feeling good about the trajectory of Subscription revenue growth at HBO, and that's at the same time you noted the 2 million subs were not revenue drivers last year. So can you just help us understand those 2 comments? And maybe what's happening in the business from your distribution partner front that makes you feel good about an accelerating revenue outlook at HBO, which seems to be what you're hinting at. I don't want put words in your mouth, but I was wondering if you could add some more color there.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, you're right in what you're thinking. We think in -- for outlook and for '14, we're in a great position from a content position on both of them, and we think that's going to yield to sub growth, rate increase growth and international growth. So in the U.S., we grew 8% in the fourth quarter and 6% in the -- for the year 2013. That did include a benefit of around 400 basis points -- sorry, overall, I'm saying. That included a benefit about 400 basis points from the consolidation of HBO Asia and Nordic in the quarter. And it did -- it added about 100 basis points for the year. So think of it as we ended up around 5%. We did see the rates were pretty steady and increasing domestically in the mid single-digit range. There were healthy sub gains, up 2 million subs in the U.S., more overseas. As we said on the call, those did not translate into as much revenue growth due to the mix of sub additions. A lot of the sub growth was in the highest-performing affiliates. The sub trends outside the U.S. have been strong, big opportunities we just said. And including the unconsolidated JVs, international subs increased by double digits in 2013. So does that give you the color that you were looking for? I do want to emphasize that we expect improvement, but we're not looking for a dramatic step-up domestically, but we think it will be up in terms of revenue growth along with the sub growth.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. And if I could just follow up with a quick Warner Bros. question. You guys have talked about the licensing business, your SVOD revenues in the past. I want to say $350 million-or-so a year, maybe a little more. How did that shake out in '13? And given your Netflix output deal, which is pretty unique at Warner Bros., what's the outlook look like for '14 and for the backlog? Or any expectations directionally on how that business is trending?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "All right. So as a starting point, we generated around $375 million in '13. That was up slightly from '12. We think it's at the top of our competitive set, and I do want to point out, that does not include the revenue -- SVOD revenue for the CW Network, which is pretty significant. So we do remain in active negotiations with all the major players. We think we can grow on -- above that in '14, pretty healthy plans we have for that. And a fair amount of that is probably going to come from international territories. Everyone, I think, should keep it in perspective. This is a -- it's a good, growing, but small portion of our revenue. It's only around 10% of our TV syndication revenue last year. That would be equal to about 3% of total film and TV revenue. And maybe more important, what's very clear is that there is a consumer demand for this content in an on-demand environment. So all particularly true for past seasons of serialized shows, which had been less effective as we all know in syndication on linear schedule. So we think that we're going to be able to monetize effectively and have increases in this category going forward.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mr. Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I wanted to focus on affiliate fees as well. A couple of questions for Jeff. First, Jeff, did you see a noticeable impact from bundling HBO on a video-light tier. I know it's early days. I think Comcast had a broadband/broadcast HBO sort of video-light offer. And to the extent it is helping, should we expect a meaningful expansion in the number of distributors that might launch that type of offer?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "All right, on the Comcast Internet offer, it's a relatively new offer, it's pretty targeted, but we're very supportive of it. We've been saying for a while that it makes sense to work with distributors to increase penetration of HBO on a mutually beneficial way. Broadband-only is a good thing for people to try. It could be an effective way to reach the 8 million to 10 million homes that have broadband without multichannel. We don't think, and we'll see, that it's going to have a material effect on the demand for the basic package. People that want that full TV/video package with broadband and all that are probably going to continue to do that. But to the extent that either some of them move this other way, that's fine with us.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "The -- and I guess the second area is, in the past, you talked about sort of an over-the-top virtual MVPD, that you didn't see a viable business model and you didn't want to license your networks unless you did see a viable business model. And there's been more progress this year. I think Intel was reportedly close to some deals before they sold, and DISH is close to doing something pretty interesting with Disney on this front, and Sony is talking about launching something over-the-top this year. Has your view about the viability of a virtual MVPD business model changed at all? And do you think there could be activity even in the Time Warner front in 2014?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, we were -- yes. I mean, it hasn't changed much. There's been more talk than action. Specifically, if you look at Sony, Verizon, and we talk to all of them all the time. Fine, we'll evaluate each of those as they come. We are absolutely open to opportunistically grow our business. We're not philosophically opposed to it. If there's an offering, a virtual one, that serves consumers and that they want, and if it is something that we think is sustainable economically for us and not something where you get a little money there and you cannibalize bigger money somewhere else, then yes, that would be something we would consider or maybe do. We just haven't seen anybody come forward with a viable powerful consumer offering yet.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have 2 topics. The first is capital allocation. I'm not sure how the timing of the $5 billion, when you would utilize that. And I guess, as part of capital allocation, I know Howard touched on M&A. But -- and I guess, Jeff, what's your view on -- are you strategically complete? And if not, what parts of the business do you think you're missing? I mean, you've gotten so much smaller over the last few years, would you like to get bigger?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "[indiscernible] The first one, what's the first one?", "Michael Kopelman", "It's capital, the pace of the buyback.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "The pace of the buyback...", "Howard M. Averill", "Yes, so Jessica, thank you. The pace of the buyback is going to really be driven by a couple of different factors. It's going to be driven based on the cash flow generation, which as I pointed out in my earlier remarks, we think it's going to be strong next year. And it's also going to be dependent upon what comes along in terms of M&A and how much we spend in terms of M&A activity. We just raised the leverage target, as we just announced, and we're not going to give specific guidance on the buyback itself, but all of those things together are going to be factors that drive it. And I would say, sitting here today, you should expect to see probably the same, pretty much pace as we had last year.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "On M&A, we pretty much have said what our philosophy is. We've tried to be disciplined, spent close to $0.5 billion on acquisitions in '13, a little under $700 million in 2012, and about $400 million in 2011. So we've done things where we think that they both have returns and strengthen our position competitively, strategically. We do have as both, I think -- well, Howard said it, we do have sufficient scale in all the things we're doing now, so we don't have to do anything. That -- but since we do have scale, we're a pretty effective buyer if something comes up where we could combine it with what we're doing and increase the profitability or sustainability of whatever we buy. We basically look through the filters of execution, strategic fit, competitive augmentation and the risk of whether we know how to manage the thing and whether it's really going to work out. We've been mostly focused on the deals we have done on international opportunities, particularly in the network side, local television production and games. Those that have tended to be smaller in nature, but that's -- we don't have an inability to consider the larger things if they fit the criteria that I was talking about.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then the second -- can I just ask one more that's on -- with a second subject? If that's okay? I just want to ask one more question. So you said that Warner Bros. will produce 60 shows this year, and obviously, there are others producing -- sorry?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "61.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Oh, sorry, sorry. So roughly 60, while others are producing and there are clearly new startups. So the question is, given the increase in original TV production supply, are you concerned at all about either how the market will absorb all these shows, how the market will digest all of this output?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Well, thank you for that question. The reason we're at 61 shows is the market is coming to our door and asking us to make the shows and sell it to them. So we've had a very vigorous demand and increase in basically what we've been doing on all 4 broadcast networks. On pretty much all the different cable, basic cable networks, all of them are doing more shows. So on your 60, we have 32 shows on broadcast. That's the most -- we have, of those, the most returning shows we've had in over 30 years. We are -- W -- Warner Bros. TV is the leading supplier of prime time programming to broadcasters again this year. So as the TV networks, the broadcast ones, solidify their economics with retrans and so forth, it has worked -- I mean, they'd certainly want to produce shows that they themselves make, but they also want a healthy supply of quality shows to strengthen their networks. And as the, basically, second supplier to all of them, it's been a good position for us. The cable network business, whether -- not just TNT, TBS, but FX, USA, A&E, AMC, a pretty good set of demands coming from them, too. So it is -- at this point, TV production and the revenue support for those shows that you can make, if you're the producer, overseas from international licensing and from SVOD is going up, so it's a very strong business with very good returns.", "Operator", "And it looks like our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on all your commentary on HBO, and then a quick one on Turner. On HBO, how much do you think the pricing strategy of other premium channels or SVOD providers like Netflix influence your ability to sort of push for higher rates, if at all? And then on Turner, just any more color, Howard, maybe you can give us on the advertising revenue in the quarter. I know you cited a dip in the industry demand and then, of course, the CNN challenge is a tough comp. But the ratings at TBS, do they -- I guess how much did they influence the number? And you seem more optimistic about the outlook. Is that also -- does that assume some further improvement at TBS?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "All right. So on HBO, first, obviously, it's been sitting in a package with pay TV like Starz, Showtime, basic cable for many years. So that's always been competitive and it hasn't -- there's no change in the pricing environment for HBO in that regard. If you ask about, as you did, the new subscription entries, whether it's Netflix, Amazon, Hulu Plus, et cetera, most of those subs are complementary, and doing something, where in fact, the highest -- if you look at -- I think Netflix viewing, for one, is higher in HBO homes. HBO viewing is higher in Netflix homes. So those are add-ons. Those are homes that want both the demand for -- not just pay TV but basic TV. So far, whether it's cord-cutting or cord-shaving, not apparently affected by the additional online offerings, which are good and offer more library than current. So all that's fitting together pretty well. And, no, we don't see any discernible effect on subs or pricing in HBO from SVOD.", "Howard M. Averill", "And Alexia, it's Howard. So as we did say in the call, advertising was up 1%, and that included mid single-digit growth in domestic entertainment including kids and young adults. It was domestic news that was down. It was down in the mid-teens, and that's due to the political comp. As far as ratings, there was a ratings impact from TNT and to a lesser extent, TBS. It contributed a bit against our expected growth. And as we mentioned, there was a slow patch in scatter, kind of in November. If you just look ahead to the first quarter, though, we are seeing scatter pricing for the entertainment's up in the high-single to low-double-digits over the upfront. And we're seeing strength across a pretty broad array of categories, so food, packages goods, fast food, auto, and demand for sports continues to look really strong. And additionally, we mentioned that we're going to be airing the Elite Eight games in the first quarter. We didn't have that last year. And we're also going -- it could be a 200, 300, 400 [ph] basis-point impact in the quarter. And at CNN, the comparisons do get easier in the first quarter, but we are still seeing relatively soft demand. Overall, the one place where we're going to see some improvement is international due to easier news comps. And in terms of the Olympics, we do see some impact including on sports, but we think it's going to be pretty modest. I think if you take it all the way, though, what we're going to end up with and we're counting -- expecting kind of an acceleration in that growth to the mid- to high-single-digits, as I mentioned.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thank you.

This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter and the other updating our 2014 full year business outlook, which as a reminder excludes Time Inc.", "Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.", "Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Thank you.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning. We had an excellent first quarter. Excluding Time Inc., revenues grew 10%, adjusted operating income increased 12% and adjusted earnings per share was up 26%. We also generated over $1.7 billion in free cash flow.", "For just one quarter into the year, that provides a pretty good indication of the return we can achieve on our investments in programming and of the growth potential of our businesses. And as a result of our strong start to the year, this morning we raised our outlook for 2014 adjusted EPS to grow in the low-teens. That's not an unusual level of growth for us.", "Over the past five years, we have grown adjusted EPS at least in the low-teens every year. Our growth in any given year maybe higher or lower, depending on factors like the timing of new affiliate agreements or investments in program, but on average, we think we can continue to grow adjusted EPS in the low to mid-teens, if not better, over at least the next three to four years.", "We have an established track record of turning solid operating growth into even more attractive returns for our shareholders, and we're extremely confident, we can continue to do so for the foreseeable future.", "Our confidence is underpinned by the strength of our brands, by industry-leading scale across our businesses and by the increasing value of our engaging and globally relevant content. All of those factors have been evident in our negotiations during Turner's current domestic affiliate renewal cycle.", "In fact, based on the deals we've already completed, we anticipate double-digit growth in domestic subscription revenue at Turner will extend another two years beyond the 2013 through 2016 period that we previously discussed with you. That's double-digit growth on average over five years and it provides a lot of visibility into our earnings power over that time period.", "Given our confidence in our growth prospects and strong cash generation year-to-date, we have decided to accelerate our share repurchases starting this quarter, and we now expect to reach our target net leverage of 2.75x by the end of this year.", "Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking through some recent operational highlights. Nowhere was the growing popularity and improving economics of our content more evident this quarter than at Warner Bros.", "In the first quarter of 2014, Warner has picked up right where it left off last year, finishing number one at the domestic box office, and collecting more Academy Awards than all the other major studios combined, led by seven for Gravity, including Best Director for Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. Not bad for a movie that also finished with over $700 million at the global box office.", "Warner's performance at the box office in the first quarter was a result of its continued development of franchise films with global appeal, including The LEGO Movie, which was the quarter's number one release at the domestic box office, and 300: Rise of an Empire.", "Warner is already working on another LEGO Movie for release in 2017. We think that LEGO has the ability to be an evergreen franchise that along with DC Comics and with J.K. Rowling's new series of films, will underpin the economics of our film business for many, many years.", "As you may know, our relationship with LEGO also includes important video game and television properties, underscoring our ability to monetize high-quality intellectual property across the company.", "So with a strong start to the year, our promising slate of movies for this summer and a great line up of television shows to be announced at the upfront in a couple of weeks, Warner is in position to have another great year in 2014.", "HBO also got off to a red-hot start this year with True Detective garnering the largest ever viewership for a freshman series on the HBO network. The success of True Detective means that HBO's current line up includes four of its top five highest rated shows ever. Of course that includes Game of Thrones, which has become a global phenomenon.", "Season 4 premiered to HBO's largest audiences since the Sopranos Finale, and Season 3's home video release had the highest first month sales of any HBO show ever in HBO's history. And if anything, Game of Thrones has taught us a vital lesson, decline any wedding invitation in Westeros.", "The success of HBO's groundbreaking original storytelling has always been a testament to visionary creators such as the Game of Thrones' team David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, True Detective's Nick Pizzolatto and Silicon Valley's Mike Judge, and the fantastic actors that they attract as well as the strength of HBO's brand and best-in-class marketing.", "But I think HBO's record audiences are also a result of its leadership in making its content available on-demand and across all major platforms. We firmly believe that if you have great content, giving consumers control over where, when and on what platform they watch it, will drive increased consumption and value. That's the promise of TV Everywhere, and there is no better example of that than HBO's success with HBO on-demand and HBO GO.", "In keeping with the spirit of taking advantage of new platforms to connect with consumers and improve monetization, HBO announced last week that it would be making a selection of its catalog programming available to Amazon Prime Instant Video.", "We are hopeful that availability on Prime Instant Video will introduce additional consumers to the great content that HBO produces and will potentially drive sub-additions over time to the HBO network service. And we plan to use additional revenue from the deal to invest even more in HBO's groundbreaking original programming and to further accelerate the development of next generation of HBO GO.", "It's that combination of unrivaled content, including the strongest slate of Hollywood movie hits and the use of the latest technology that has helped HBO to become the world's leading premium TV and subscription video-on-demand service. Given the positive subscriber trends, we've seen both in recent years and so far in 2014, we feel great about HBO's ability to drive continued growth for many years to come.", "Turner also had a landmark start to the year, bringing the Elite Eight and the Final Four to cable for the first time ever. The NCAA Tournament continues to be a runaway success and its strong linear TV performance was accentuated by more than 40% growth in digital video streams for March Madness Live.", "Like HBO GO, March Madness Live is a great example of how TV Everywhere can enhance the consumer experience and the value of our networks through distributors. And the success of the NCAA Tournament helped TBS maintain its number one position in ad supported cable among adults 18 to 49.", "Similarly, Adult Swim continues to lead the industry of attracting younger viewers. Once again finishing the first quarter as the number one ad supported cable network in total day for adults 18 to 34. To better take advantage of the growing demand for its distinctive content, we recently expanded Adult Swim to the 8.00 PM hour.", "We also have momentum at CNN, which grew delivery in its key demo over 50% in March, again demonstrating that it's the authoritative voice, viewers turn to when news breaks. Just as important, CNN generated nearly 4 billion page views and 275 million video starts in March. That's its biggest month ever for both metrics.", "In a world where consumers increasingly look to digital products for their news, CNN has a substantial lead on its cable news peers in cross platform unique users, and actually has the largest number of monthly unique mobile users of any news service domestically, and we're just getting started.", "At its upfront, earlier this month, CNN introduced CNNx, which represents a leap forward in interactive merits, and it's a product that CNN is unique positioned to provide. It's available today on your tablet and you'll start seeing it on set top boxes later this year. We think it will be another real point of differentiation for CNN.", "Despite these successes and having three of the top 10 cable networks in adults 18 to 49 in the first quarter, we are not satisfied with the recent ratings and advertising performance at some of the Turner network. At truTV for example, we followed a couple of strong years with a significant drop off in performance.", "But we have new leadership in place, who just announced the slate of innovative unscripted programs that will start in May with The Carbonaro Effect, and continue through this fall with shows like MOTOR CITY MASTERS, Way Out West and Hair Jacked. We think it's some of the best and most creative programming the network has ever done, and that give us great confidence in truTV and in our ability to materially improve its monetization over time.", "We've also had some challenges at TNT. It was the top five cable network in prime time last year and it had some of the most popular originals on basic cable, but it can and will do better. Over the past few years, we didn't take enough creative risk with its programming, and as a result, TNT has lost ground with younger viewers.", "We've already started to address that with the new programming that you'll see this summer, including The Last Ship, Murder in the First and Legends. These shows should also help TNT expand its audience with key male demos.", "To be clear, these types of changes take time and we won't get to where we want to be in the quarter or two. But we've all seen that network performance tends to move in cycles. And by virtue of its scale and our position as the world's leading producer of high quality television product, TNT has accessed all the resources it needs.", "We're confident and we're determined that we will see improvement as the year progresses and that we can drive growth in its audience and its economics over time. At Time Inc., the new management team has made great progress in preparing for success as an independent public company. We are on track to complete the spin in the next month or so, and you'll hear more about their plans as that date approaches.", "So in closing, I am really pleased with how we've started 2014. We're making progress on our strategic initiatives across the company. And at the same time, our investments in great storytelling and journalism are paying off, allowing us to produce very attractive financial results. And with the global growth in demand for our content continuing unabated, we think we're in a great position to grow at these kinds of attractive levels for a very long time.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Howard.", "Howard Averill", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Given that we expect to complete the spin-off of Time Inc. this quarter and our full year outlook excludes Time Inc., I will focus my remarks on our company results prepared on the same basis.", "Excluding Time Inc., revenues were up 10% and we had leverage all the way down the income statement with adjusted operating income increasing 12% and adjusted EPS growing 26%. Turner, HBO and Warner Bros. all posted record first quarter adjusted operating income.", "So to reiterate, what Jeff said, we're off to a great start in 2014. Adjusted operating income margins expanded 60 basis points, despite a 9% increase in expenses and net expense growth was largely related to content investments at Warner Bros. and Turner, and the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic.", "SG&A was flat in the quarter and it would have been down, excluding the consolidations, as we continue to focus on funding aggressive investments in programming by limiting growth in other expenses.", "We were able to grow adjusted EPS even faster than adjusted operating income, due mostly to our ongoing share repurchase program and improved results at our equity investments, including HBO Latin America. We also had a benefit of almost $40 million from recognition of interest income on a long-standing note receivable that was collected.", "During the quarter, we repurchased close to $1 billion in shares, and combined with our dividend we've returned almost $1.6 billion to shareholders year-to-date. We also had a very strong quarter for free cash flow, generating $1.7 billion, nearly 80% increase from last year's first quarter.", "And as Jeff mentioned, in light of our strong first quarter and our confidence in the remainder of the year, we've raised our 2014 outlook for adjusted EPS excluding Time Inc. We now expect growth to be in the low-teens. I'll tough more on the details of our outlook throughout the presentation.", "Now, turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner. The revenues and adjusted operating income continued to grow despite rating and FX headwinds.", "Subscription revenues grew 7% in the quarter, which included more than 100 basis point drag from FX. Domestic subscription revenue growth was solidly in the high single-digits, a significant acceleration relative to the past couple of years. And that acceleration was the result of rate increases related to Turner's domestic affiliate renewals.", "Excluding the impact of FX, international subscription revenue was also up in the high single-digits with largest gains coming from Latin America, which remains our strongest region and where we continue to see healthy subscriber trends. Looking forward, we'll continue to benefits from Turner's domestic affiliate renewals for the remainder of the year.", "And as Jeff noted, we anticipate this will be a sustained lift in our subscription revenue growth rate. Based on deals we already have in place, we expect to grow our domestic subscription revenue at low double-digit rate on average through 2018.", "Turning to advertising. Revenues increased 5% in the quarter, which was at the lower end of the range we originally expected, and that included the impact of both soft ratings and moderate demand in the scatter market. Of that growth, about 300 basis points was due to the NCAA Tournament, including the benefit from airing two NCAA Elite Eight games.", "Domestic advertising increased similarly to the overall result, and that included mid single-digit increase at domestic entertainment, including kids and young adults and a low single-digit growth at our news networks.", "Excluding a drag of approximately 400 basis points from FX, international advertising would have been up high single-digits. That reflected solid underlying growth in Latin America and international news.", "Looking ahead to the second quarter, scatter pricing is up high single to low double-digits over the upfront, with volume still relatively modest and we expect ratings to remain a drag on our performance.", "Also keep in mind that as a result of airing two Final Four games, the NCAA should provide around a 300 basis point benefit in the quarter. Taking all of that into account, we anticipate total advertising to grow in the low single-digits in the second quarter.", "Moving on, adjusted operating income grew 3% in the quarter and that included a 9% increase in programming cost, primarily due to the NCAA Tournament and continued investments in original programming across our networks. Consistent with our focus on costs discipline, we limited non-programming expense growth to just 2% in the quarter.", "As we look to the remainder of 2014, we anticipate Turner's adjusted operating income growth to accelerate, starting in the second quarter. And despite ongoing investments in sports and original programming, we expect solid margin expansion for the year. So Turner is on pace for another good year in 2014.", "Moving onto HBO, where we saw strong growth in both revenues and adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up 8% in the quarter with consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic, contributing around 400 basis points to that growth.", "Building on a strong 2013, our domestic subscriber trends remain positive, and similar to the past few quarters, the majority of recent subscriber additions have been non-revenue generating. So while that's a good barometer of consumer demand for HBO, subscriber growth did not have a material impact on our revenue.", "Turning to content revenues, which were up 13% in the quarter, and that was primarily due to very strong home video sales of Season 3 of Game of Thrones, which more than offset softness in library product. Looking ahead, we anticipate a significant bump in content revenues in the second quarter due to the Amazon deal announced last week.", "As Jeffery noted, HBO intends to invest the majority of proceeds from the transaction back into programming, marketing and technology. So we don't expect to commensurate increase in profits this year.", "Adjusted operating income was up 11% in the quarter and margins expanded almost 100 basis points, and that was despite the drag on margins from the international consolidations. Programming expenses increased 8% with 600 basis points of that growth due to the consolidations.", "Underneath that, acquired theatrical expenses increased, while programming write-offs decreased. Absent to programming write-offs, original programming expenses would have increased in the mid single-digits.", "Across HBO's international properties, first quarter results were equally impressive. Total international revenue, including unconsolidated JVs, was up double-digits and subscriber trends remain strong, especially in Latin America.", "Like the rest of the company, HBO remains focused on containing overheads in order to help fund investments in programming and technology. And adjusting for the international consolidations, SG&A was down in the quarter and total non-programming expenses were up just 2%. So HBO started the year with a lot of momentum from both an operating and a financial perspective and it's on track for another year of solid growth.", "Turning now to Warner's, which had a record first quarter, growing revenue by 14% and adjusted operating income by more than 40%. Strong theatrical performance was the biggest driver of growth in the quarter led by the box office success of The LEGO Movie and 300: Rise of an Empire, as well as carryover revenue from the latest Hobbit installment and Gravity.", "On the TV side, revenue and associated profits grew due to higher initial telecast revenue related to increased production as well as continued growth from international syndication. We also benefited from double-digit gains and SVOD revenue, mainly due to international growth. We continue to see healthy demand for our product from SVOD services and expect contributions from the SVOD distribution channel to increase this year.", "Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue was down in the quarter, largely due to the timing of the release of the latest Hobbit installment on home video, which is in the second quarter this year versus the first quarter of last year. Despite that, digital trends remain positive with Warner electronic sell-through up over 20% in the first quarter.", "Consumer spending across the broader home video market was also down in the first quarter due to a softer theatrical slate and the timing of Easter. But digital growth was even stronger for the industry with electronic sell-through up 45%.", "So on the whole, we remain very encouraged by the ongoing transition to digital. To help drive that transition, Warner continues to champion industry-wide digital ownership initiative like UltraViolet, which now has over 17 million accounts.", "Looking ahead, Warner has very difficult theatrical comparison for the rest of the year. Even so, given a strong start theatrically and positive trends in the TV business, Warner is on pace for another record year in 2014.", "Now, onto Time Inc. With the new management team is driving significant changes critical to its success, as an independent public company. Revenues increased 1% in the quarter and benefited from the acquisition of American Express Publishing Corporation.", "Excluding this, revenues would have decreased 5% with advertising down 7% and subscription flat. Revenues also benefited from one additional issue each of people and time compared to last year. Adjusted operating loss was $94 million and that was primarily a result of $115 million in restructuring charges in the quarter.", "To offset challenging revenue trends, the management team has been extremely focused on cost discipline and changing the way Time Inc. operates, with a goal of stabilizing the business and freeing up resources to invest in growth initiatives. And excluding the acquisition and restructuring charges, expenses fell 3% in the quarter.", "Looking forward, Time Inc. remains on track with the outlook we provided in February. Excluding restructuring and severance charges, we expect modest declines in full year adjusted operating income in 2014. And that's largely a function of continuing revenue pressure and incremental public company and stock compensation expenses that Time Inc. will incur this year.", "As Jeff noted, we remain on track to complete the spin-off of Time Inc. this quarter. And as part of that process, Time Inc. recently issued senior notes and senior commitments for $1.4 billion in debt and a $500 million revolver. That's consistent with our plan for an initial capital structure that includes approximately $1.3 billion in net debt.", "We think this will allow sufficient flexibility to both invest in the business and provide direct returns to shareholders, while also optimizing its cost of capital and delivering attractive levered equity returns to investors. So, Time Inc. has made a lot of progress and is well on its way to executing against its goals for the year and successfully making the transition to a standalone public company.", "Moving to free cash flow and including Time Inc., which was very strong in the quarter, the big year-over-year improvement is primarily due to the strong growth in adjusted operating income and a favorable swing in working capital.", "The improvement in working capital reflects lower participations and production spend due to title mix at Warner Bros. and the timing of sports programming payments at Turner. Cash interest improved due to the receipt of interest income I noted earlier, but given the additional debt we took on late last year, we expect cash interest to increase for the remainder of the year.", "The decline in cash taxes was primarily the result of the timing of audit settlements. As with interest expense, our cash taxes are likely to be higher for the full year due to the expiration of certain favorable tax legislation.", "Putting that all together, we do not expect free cash flow to grow at this level for the year. Nonetheless, we're off to a great start from a cash perspective and we fully expect to deliver another year of strong free cash flow in 2014.", "Now, onto net debt. We ended the first quarter with $16.7 billion of net debt, down versus the end of 2013 due to the very strong free cash flow generation I just noted, and $1.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of our office space in Time Warner Center. Out net leverage ratio was 2.2x as of March 31.", "We returned about $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, and that's consistent with our continued commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders.", "As Jeff mentioned, we intend to move to a target net leverage ratio of 2.75x by the end of 2014, which is faster than our initial plan. Our decision to move more quickly to our target leverage is a reflection of both our confidence in the company's outlook and our view that our stock is very attractive at current level.", "In light of that, we'll be accelerating our share repurchase program in the coming quarters. By moving more quickly to our target leverage, we will also move back toward a more efficient cash position following significant inflows from the sale of our office space and the Time Inc. spent.", "At the same time, we continue to invest aggressively in our businesses. We've already discussed the investments we are making in great contents across our divisions. We're also investing in strategic M&A to improve our competitive position, add new capabilities and accelerate growth, especially outside the U.S.", "While we don't need to do M&A, we're always open to opportunities that complement our existing assets and provide risk-adjusted returns that are more attractive than our alternative uses of capital. And already this year we've committed over $700 million to acquire Eyeworks' international television production operations and to fund an additional round of investment in CME.", "This combination of investing in our businesses, opportunistic M&A and significant direct return to shareholders is the same balanced approach to capital allocation we've been employing for a number of years now, and we still believe it's the right approach today.", "Now, onto the final slide, which shows our outlook for 2014. We had a great first quarter and feel really good about how we are positioned for the rest of this year. That's given us the confidence to raise our full year 2014 outlook to low-teens adjusted EPS growth.", "And keep in mind, that despite our expectation of a negative swing in inter-company eliminations and a higher effective tax rate, between the two, we still anticipate a negative year-over-year impact of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 to adjusted EPS for the year.", "Looking more closely at the second quarter, we have somewhat more challenging comparison against what was a very strong quarter a year ago. Even so we anticipate solid growth in both adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS. We're doing all this while investing aggressively for future growth. And as Jeff mentioned, we think we can continue to grow adjusted EPS at attractive levels for the foreseeable future.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Howard. Joe, can you please open up the lines for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And it looks like our first question here comes from Mr. Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Meghan Durkin - Deutsche Bank", "This is actually Meghan Durkin standing in for Doug. So you talked for a couple of times about the softness in the scatter market. I am curious to hear how the tone is in the sports advertising market and how that compares to the entertainment ad market? And then I have a follow-up.", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Well, scatter has been relatively steady, but within the sports side it tends to be a little bit softer, we have seen that. And I think what's happened is we are seeing some pull from World Cup coming out of the marketplace just like we saw in the first quarter with the Olympics. So it's a little bit softer than we had anticipated.", "Meghan Durkin - Deutsche Bank", "The entertainment is just going along similar to how it's been, kind of a little soft?", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Well, I would say that, if I just stated generally speaking that, we're not seeing quite as much volume. On the entertainment side, we're seeing more of a drag from the ratings side, more so than just the volumes, it's more on -- there's a drag from the ratings.", "Meghan Durkin - Deutsche Bank", "And then on a completely different topic. I was interested to hear how Jeff would respond to Jeff Katzenberg's recent comments when he was quoted, as saying that movies are not a growth business, but television is.", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Well, maybe it's for him. He doesn't make very many movies. We've been doing fine in movies. And let's just put some context on. So 2013 for Warner Bros was a record year domestically. We had a very strong slate. We were number one in the box office. I think 2014 was off to a strong start, it's up about 7% in the first quarter.", "And we also see continued growth overseas, which has become a bigger driver of our business. International demand on theatrical side is particularly strong for the kinds of the best films that we produce. And we already talked in our -- what we've said already about the films that we had including LEGO and 300 this first quarter, but if you go to the rest of the year, we do have some tough comparisons given how strong we were last year.", "But we had a great year last year. For the rest of '14 the slate looks good. We have Godzilla coming, Edge of Tomorrow and the final installment of The Hobbit. So we think we're going to have a record year in 2014. We do think we can grow the business over time and we've been doing it. So we don't agree with that view. And I think it maybe -- the business at their end is quite different.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Mr. Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.", "Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Jeff, the extension of your affiliate revenue growth trajectory, the double-digit CAGR into 2018. Trying to get a sense for sort of how much is fully baked already? You have talked about the CAGR through '16, and you had seven of the top 10 deals done. Can you give us some context on the '18 outlook, why did you decide to reveal that to us today and sort of what's the new distribution landscape look like in your decision to go there?", "And obviously that lifts the growth of the company and the earnings power of the company over multiple years. Just want to get a little more color on that. And on HBO, the subscriber trends are great. What has to happen to translate the subscriber growth to better revenue growth in the U.S.?", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Let's do the Turner first. The reason we just wanted to go farther out, we've had the deals that we've been mentioning in place for a while. We had given guidance out three years, we thought that was enough in terms of how our affiliate sales were going. We kept getting questions about our growth after '16, since we have pretty good visibility in it, we thought, we ought to say, since we have deals that go beyond '16, we should provide a little more clarity.", "The rate increases we have, we're seeing not just through '16, but also through '18, because the outlook for the three years through '16 hasn't changed. It's still the attractive ramp that we told you about before, but it just continues for a couple of more years. We thought we ought to say that. So that's the Turner stock.", "In terms of HBO, there's really strong programming or strong critics and ratings performance, there is strong take-up of GO, there is strong take up of international subscriber growth and there is a pretty robust steady trend in domestic, which I think is where your question is focused. Basically, there is two ways to improve the mix in terms of how we view the deals to provide incentives for affiliate performance.", "First, we can focus more resources working with our underperforming affiliates. And that's a combination of incentives and other actions to get out of those markets, the natural HBO subscriber penetration that HBO really earns in terms of its program. And if we're not going to get it through the affiliates that are underperforming, we are going to find ways to make that happen.", "Second, we look to sharing the upside of our best performing affiliate and those are the ones who have been really setting a clear benchmark for where HBO can go. And so when we take those deal structures and fit into the more HBO participation in the upside that takes a little bit of time as the renewals come in.", "And then finally, if you add on top of that some of the innovations, that certain affiliates have come up with, which are lower-priced packages that you can put HBO in, some broadband-only efforts by facility-based distributors. These are all pretty promising. And I'm not going to give more specifics, but what we have, which is the fundamental underlying good fact is that the viewer's love the HBO program.", "The rights and ability of HBO GO to provide it in a very great exciting way is increasing, and the upside that we get from --so that's producing an ability on our part to invest a lot more in programming. We're going to use most of the proceeds from the Amazon transaction to increase our programming going forward. So it's adding up to a very nice platform for future growth, for acceleration of HBO, revenue and earnings growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson", "I have two, one is for Howard, and one is for Jeff. Howard, first on SVOD. You guys have been pretty transparent about SVOD revenues over the past couple of years. I know you won't call it Amazon particularly, but can you give us a sense in '14, how big will SVOD get for the company when you're looking at the entire landscape of SVOD deals? Would you be getting over $500 million or so for '14?", "And then for Jeff, I wondered what the move to Amazon represents in terms of what you see for HBO GO in terms of usage trends? Are you seeing pretty much the usage trend is focused on newer product, and therefore the catalog has been pretty much tapped out for HBO GO? And you think there's a chance that, find people who have never seen it before? So what do you have the research on usage by catalog versus new?", "Howard Averill", "Michael, first on SVOD. So the starting point, we generated about $375 million last year and that was up slightly from 2012 and we think that's near the top of our competitive set. By the way, it doesn't include the revenue that The CW network directly receives from SVOD, which is pretty significant. So we're going to be able to grow that again in 2014. And in terms of where the growth is coming from, a lot of that is coming from international territories", " But again, to keep the overall in the perspective, it is a small portion of our overall revenue. It's about 10% of our TV licensing revenue last year and it's only about 3% of film and TV revenue. More importantly, it's probably the fact that it's clear that there is consumer demand for this content in an on-demand environment and that's particularly true for past seasons of serialized shows. So I'm pretty confident that we're going to be able to continue to monetize that content moving forward.", "Jeffery Bewkes", "So you were asking about basically the usage in on-demand of HBO viewers between different categories of programming; older, newer and movie series et cetera? Is that what you asked?", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson", "Right.", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Well, so let me try to give me that. That gives me a lot of good news, and which good news outweighs this other good news, so you have all read in the press that the fairly impressive numbers for HBO VOD usage on current episodes of Game of Thrones or True Detective and so on. I mean there's a tremendous usage going on of all current and new series.", "There is also, which has not gotten enough attention, a fairly strong usage both in linear programming and in some on-demand usage of the movie slate, let's not forget the movie slate at HBO, it's got by far the strongest line-up of current movie releases. What we're seeing though, when you go and you look at the interest, that viewers have all around the world, included in your question, a lot of people didn't see some of the classic hits at HBO.", "And so when you make them available, whether it's the Amazon Prime deal where you can see tremendous shows like Sopranos, but most Amazon Prime subs don't have HBO, so it's a great opportunity to familiarize them with HBO programming, get them interested as prospects for our HBO sub, the affiliates that sell HBO.", "So it's a tremendous marketing thing for HBO subscribers over time, in addition to being a very fertile place for people to buy HBO programming, so most of this you do relativity, most of that huge viewing goes to current series. But I think we're going to see some fairly strong viewing and sampling of the HBO classics and the library shows that are coming on Amazon.", "Howard Averill", "Michael, just to follow-up on the financials of the Amazon deal. We're not going to disclose the specifics, but it is a multi-year deal and we're going to be recognizing revenue reasonably evenly over all years of the contract. So in 2014, we're going to see a pretty -- we're going to recognize pretty much all the revenue related to the transaction in the second quarter.", "So when you see a pretty sizeable bump, there's going to be a benefit to HBO season in the second quarter and you're going to see similar lumpy recognition in future years. But in terms of the overall profits, we intend to invest most of those proceeds back into the business including spending on additional programming, marketing and technology spend. So the impact on 2014 is not significant.", "Jeffery Bewkes", "So the move up, which we're telling you about, the strong year we are having in '14 and the increase in guidance is mostly core trends at Time Warner. It's not in the large part coming out of the Amazon, that's a little part of it, but we're going to invest most of that part.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets", "Kind of a follow-up on something. I think given your commentary around ratings, it definitely sounds like the softness, x the NCAAs over the past couple of quarters have clearly been driven by content cyclicality as opposed to secular issues. But I wanted to try and drill down a little further, because I think this has been something of a hot topic recently for investors, especially around the upfront.", "So I was wondering if you take those sort of core low single-digit growth numbers x the impact of the NCAAs shifting, I mean you have a really enormous portfolio and there are different dayparts, different demo targets, really hard I think for us to track ratings on the outside in a specific way.", "Can you give us kind of an aggregate revenue weighted basis GRP decline, so that we could -- how much of this is about pricing versus by impressions, right? I don't mean like scatter pricing over the upfront, but actual kind of blended pricing increases. And then I guess the second part of that is, Jeff, specifically, could you kind of comment on your thoughts right now about the secular strength of national cable advertising dollars versus some of the digital guys fighting for wallet share.", "Jeffery Bewkes", "I sympathize with that question. You're trying to pull a pattern out.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you for your sympathy.", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Yes, sometimes when we're talking amongst ourselves, we say, well, let me try to collect your thoughts sort of or my thoughts. So I would simplify, so basically it's about rate, which Howard try to get at and we have stronger and weaker ratings performance. We think that if you really get into under the performance that we're seeing, which we think, it's essentially ratings, a little bit of market, but it's mostly ratings.", "And on that issue and it's like anything, follow the money, the big money is TBS, TNT. TNT has been softer than it should have been as we've talked about. Let's get into that from an investment point of view. The way we look at it, we've got the two strongest big reach networks in cable, TBS, TNT and a lot of other networks that are very strong. None of them are flank or weak networks and we need to refresh the original programming and we've got a budget that we talked to you about, that's on our trend line that gives us plenty of money to move towards younger-skewing programming, edgier programming that will fit both brands.", "And to the question of how should we view the likelihood of our succeeding, let's remind ourselves that Warner Bros. is Hollywood's leading TV studio; HBO's been more successful with its original program than any other network; Turners had some great success in broad reach, somewhat to old-skewing originals, which we're now going to focus very intently on doing younger ones. There's nothing else to say about Time Warner across those divisions. We know how to create successful TV series. And since Turner has had its share of hits, we're now moving the target towards younger male and female-skewing stuff.", "And we have new management that's going to actively pursue this, we think that we'll be able to do this and come up with something -- look, we got to do it and not be complacent, which I'm not saying I tend to be complacent about it, but we're very excited about it and we think that we have all the pieces to have very strong programming strength there over time.", "It's going to take a little while, but let's keep a couple of rating things in perspective, and not over focused on current softness at Turner, which is that the Turner domestic advertising is less than 15% of total company revenue. Now, as it turns around that will be a nice lift for us. But just keep that in mind. TBS is still number one in 18 to 49 and 18 to 34 in primetime in the first quarter. Adult Swim remains number one in 18 to 34 and 18 to 49 in total there.", "Now, TNT which had the softest was the top five network in '13 and now it's slipped off a little. And CNN is showing great momentum right now. But if you go back to basically TBS and TNT, the answer to your question is the ratings are softer than they are going to be and unless we just can't figure out how to do it, which would be I guess the only downside, this is all going to get a lot better and turn into a fairly strong mid-term and out earnings story at Turner.", "Howard Averill", "So David, let me just give you a little bit more context about the current trends and it is a combination of factors, so looking at the second quarter for example, scatter pricing for Entertainment Networks is up, it's still up high-single to low double-digits over the upfront. But again, as I mentioned, we're just not seeing much volume overall.", "And also just generally speaking to it, but also more for sports, so as I mentioned we saw demand siphoned off in the first quarter and in the second quarter we are seeing it with World Cup, and again, the ratings tend to be a little bit of a drag. Further than that, on the international side, we're also seeing a slight drag from FX and the World Cup.", "But going in the other direction we do expect about 300 basis points benefit from NCAA in the second quarter. So as I said in my prepared remarks, that all translates into low single-digit growth in advertising. But from where we sit today that would probably be even on the lower-end of low single-digits. So that gives you a little more color.", "Jeffery Bewkes", "For that quarter.", "Howard Averill", "For the quarter, right.", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Our next question here comes from Mr. Anthony DiClemente from Nomura.", "Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities", "I have two questions for either Howard or Jeff. You guys mentioned that the Amazon revenue would be recognized evenly over the horizon of the contract. You also said most of this year's revenue will be reinvested in programming and other expenses. So my question is should we think about this year as a one-time step-up in investment in HBO or do you think that the incremental margin on that kind of evenly paced Amazon revenue will expand in 2015?", "And then my second question would be in terms of the new guidance or the extension of the double-digit domestic affiliate fee growth, how should we think about how international plays into it over the course of time over that extended five-year period of time? Do you think that international cable will be accretive to that growth rate on the domestic side or not?", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Let me do the first one and then may ask you about the second. On the HBO, Amazon, what percent of the revenue lift do we decide to take into earnings in a given year? So we said we're going to invest most of it in programming and technical capacity for GO that's because it's expanding so well.", "Probably our margin on it would go up over the next few years, but we may decide to invest it as we go in more programming that we find pretty attractive, and that programming, not just supporting the service, subscriber revenue and profit domestically and overseas, those things when we have them and we like them, like with the Game of Thrones, we haven't even sold it yet.", "They turn into tremendous sources of content revenue and profit with very large contribution, once you get past hit status, so depending on what we've got, we'll decide later whether we take more of it into earnings or whether we just use it to expand the future earnings basically.", "Howard Averill", "What was the other question? Can you repeat your second?", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Could you do it again? We didn't understand.", "Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities", "The other question is as we model Turner going forward, you've got domestic and international, and you guys are providing guidance on the domestic side, and we're just trying to figure out what that equates to on a global basis. So over the next five years, do you expect the international piece to be accretive or dilutive to your double-digit affiliate fee guidance on the domestic side? Is that clear?", "Jeffery Bewkes", "You are trying to find out if the international is double-digit on its own base, is that what you're saying?", "Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities", "Yes, that'd be great to know.", "Jeffery Bewkes", "We're trying to figure out if we have thought of it that way. The international trends are really strong. Does anybody have the exact percentage growth of international?", "Howard Averill", "Ends up high single-digits in the first quarter.", "Jeffery Bewkes", "It's probably better.", "Howard Averill", "Well, we think it's going to be that, I mean, there has been a drag on FX particularly this year, but it is growing from an organic standpoint.", "Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities", "Maybe another way to ask the question would be you have these deals in place on the domestic side that are long-term and multi-year. Do you have that kind of visibility internationally that would give you the conviction to put forth kind of a similar type of affiliate guidance for international or not?", "Jeffery Bewkes", "International's is not one country, it's many. So there's no simple answer, because each territory is different. The sub-growth is different. In Latin America, which is our biggest region, the biggest driver is not the price increase in the affiliates deal, many of which we have going on and there is some decent price increases, most of it is volume increases that are pretty significant. And you can just look at the numbers we have been posting and see extremely strong, secular sub-growth all across Latin America, our biggest region.", "You then go into our other regions, Eastern Europe, the Rim of Asia, we're launching new networks, such as HBO in the Netherlands and the Nordic regions and India. CNN in Indonesia, truTV in Brazil, TNT in Chile and some of the other expansion of our South America sourced channels.", "So generally we don't see that much of -- more of the increase overseas is in sub-growth than in pricing, because it is similar to the stage of development that the international markets are in. What's good about that is that the international trends are set. And if you don't have FX going against you, you would probably be in a pretty steady double-digit neighborhood. And it's hard to say what the FX trends are going to be.", "Operator", "Our next question here comes from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne, Agee.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne, Agee", "Jeff, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on the Turner and upcoming turnaround hopefully in ratings and programming. You said that some of the originals ended up skewing-older than -- was that by design or did it just end up doing that? And I wonder if you could tell us, where you think -- I am sure you have very sophisticated research, where the viewers' went and where, assuming the cable total viewership is stable, whom should you take share from with the new programming at Turner?", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Yes. So I think the first part of your question is the reason, some of our Turner original, particularly on TNT skewed older, is it because we aimed for that and hit the target. And the answer is yes. So that actually gives us a fair amount of confidence that when we move the sighting of what we're aiming at, we'll hit that target too.", "The reason we were doing the former aim at big general entertainment audiences is that is come-off the very successful Turner strategy of being the network -- the broadcast network replacement. That was working great for the advertisers and audiences. There were shows like The Closer, Rizzoli & Isles, which have the biggest audiences in cable right next to a broadcast series", "But what's happened I think as we all know is that the younger viewership has become more important and the advertisement interest in more younger skewing, a little edgier programming than what they wanted to buy a couple of years ago has become pretty pronounced.", "Some of that is probably because there have been some very good series that showed up on some basic networks that were like that, Breaking Bad is a good example. And some of it is because everyone has got a little change in their view advertising included, the viewers too, that came out of subscription via these shows that are serialized and edgier. And so basically the interest of the audience and the growth of the younger audience has meant back the better target and that's where we'll be.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne, Agee", "And would that also translate into higher CPM hopefully?", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Yes. More ratings, higher CPMs, more money.", "Operator", "Our last question here will come from Mr. Michael Morris from Guggenheim.", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim", "Two questions, one, for Jeff. Disney and DISH recently reached a deal that allows them to provide a personal subscription service via broadband, and it requires more participation. So my question is, have you considered that? Are you discussing the topic with DISH and what would it take for you to get involved or participate in a service like that?", "And then Howard, just on return of capital, clearly great cash flow and return of capital is primarily focused on the share repurchases. Can you talk a little bit about the thought process of continuing with repurchases versus dividends, just given how strong and stable and growing your affiliate streams are, could support higher dividend growth story?", "Jeffery Bewkes", "Let me start on the DISH question. So DISH, Sony, Verizon are all expressing interest in virtual MVPDs. There is a lot of discussion about this. Of course, we're talking with all of them as we have been, and are certainly open to opportunities to grow our business. We're not philosophically opposed to that kind of structure, but we have to believe it will be additive and sustainable. And so there are a fair number of questions in terms of the ad model, the quality of service over whichever broadband method they are thinking about and how this would impact investment in the plan that we all need to develop high quality TV.", "What you asked about I think specifically, which is the DISH-Disney arrangement could be interesting for us. And it's not so different than the Comcast innovation, selling HBO on a light weight TV package. So, yes, we're talking to DISH about whether there is some applicability of that for us.", "It could allow them and other distributors to target a group of consumers, but otherwise might not subscribe to multichannel TV. And to the extent that that is a good entree into the ecosystem for younger consumers, but then either because it serves them well and does not cannibalize what they would otherwise do as a video subscriber or leaves them to become bigger package video subscribers, that's good for everybody. So we are exploring that.", "Howard Averill", "Michael, on dividend versus buyback, obviously, we think both should play a role in our effort to try to get returns. But it's important to note that we have the highest payout and the highest dividend yield of our peer group. We announced the 10% increase in our dividend back in February, at the same time as we mentioned early, we think the stock is attractive, so we also find repurchasing shares to be a good vehicle for additional returns to shareholders. And this is all really consistent with what we've done in the past few years. And the clock is really not changing. So there is no reason to expect that we're going to deviate from that formula.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks everybody for joining us today. As always we're here for any additional questions. Have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Janette, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's third quarter earnings conference call. This morning, we issued 2 press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter and the other, updating our 2014 full year business outlook.", "Before we begin, there are 2 items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO; who will be borrowed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO.", "After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for a Q&A session to answer any follow-up questions you may have from our investor event last month. With that, Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning.", "We had another quarter of solid revenue growth and strong growth in adjusted EPS, and that puts us on track for another very good year of financial performance in 2014.", "But more important, we're executing our longer range plans to go after the large and growing global opportunity we see in video content, that opportunity and our plans to capitalize on it was a focus of the investor event we held last month. I'd like to thank all of you who took the time either in person or by videocast to attend.", "We were pleased to share our long-range plan and financial targets with you. Those targets include adjusted EPS of close to $6 a share in 2016 and over $8 a share in 2018, representing a more than doubling of our earnings over the next few years.", "We also discussed with you the significant upside opportunities that we believe exist above and beyond those targets. Those include the new global kids partnership between Turner and Warner Bros and the even greater exploitation of our IP at DC Entertainment, and the potential for breakout hits at Turner and a standalone broadband-delivered HBO product we intend to introduce domestically next year.", "We've been positioning ourselves to go after that big opportunity in video I mentioned earlier by streamlining our company, putting in a new generation of collaborative leaders and executing a strategy that has not only served Time Warner and its shareholders well over the past several years, but is also evolving to incorporate new opportunities outside the traditional ecosystem.", "And with our scale position and our leading portfolio of brands, we think we are the best positioned media company to take advantage of that opportunity.", "While evolving, our strategy remains focused on 4 key areas: content, technology, international and efficiency. And there's a reason that investing in content is at the top of the list because great content is the life blood of our company.", "We spent close to $14 billion on content and related marketing expenses last year. We'll invest even more this year and in the years ahead because of our confidence in our unique ability to monetize those investments.", "For example, both HBO and Turner had double-digit increases in Subscription revenues during the quarter, and that flows directly from having the best story to tell.", "You can see further evidence of our commitment to the best storytelling in the 19 Primetime Emmy Awards HBO received, the most of any network for the 13th consecutive year, with True Detective receiving 5 awards. And as I've mentioned before, True Detective was the most-watched freshman series in HBO history. And it wasn't the only successful new hit on a service that already boasts its strongest lineup of original shows ever.", "Newcomer, The Leftovers, averaged over 7 million viewers per episode, received a lot of critical acclaim and has been renewed for a second season.", "Turner is also investing in great original content, and you're seeing the results of those investments. TNT ranked its ad-supported cable's #1 prime time network for the second consecutive quarter. TNT's series, Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes and The Last Ship, comprised 3 of the top 5 original series on ad-supported cable in the third quarter, and TBS was the #2 ad-supported cable network in prime time among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54.", "But not to be outdone, Adult Swim was once again ad-supported cable's #1 total day network among all its key adult demos.", "Turner's recent extension of its 3-decade relationship with the NBA through the 2024 to 25 season is yet another great example of investing in distinctive programming that will serve us well for years to come.", "The agreement will further grow our partnership with additional games, continued management of NBA's digital assets and new digital rights for Bleacher Report.", "Our investment in great storytelling is also paying off at Warners, which is the leading producer for broadcast TV for the 11th time out of the past 12 seasons.", "This fall, the Big Bang Theory and The Voice are once again, the #1 scripted and non-scripted shows, respectively, on all of television. And we're particularly pleased with 2 new shows, Gotham, which ranks as broadcast's #2 new show with adults 18 to 49; and The Flash, whose premiere drew close to 7 million viewers, making it The CW's most-watched telecast ever. Both those programs are based on IP from our DC Entertainment group, and they lead a roster of 5 DC-based shows that we have on broadcast this season.", "As Warner announced at our investor event, DC is also a big part of our theatrical strategy with 10 DC-based films slated for release between 2016 and 2020.", "Warner also unveiled plans for films built around the LEGO franchise and the World of Harry Potter conceived by J. K. Rowling.", "More imminently, we're going to see another terrific example of our franchise products when the final installment in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, Battle of the Five Armies, storms theaters in December.", "As we're investing in great content, it's worth emphasizing our commitment to a strong multichannel ecosystem. That commitment is clear in the new NBA agreement I just mentioned, which represents an investment of more than $10 billion in the kind of must-have content that makes the TV bundle so valuable to consumers, and it makes our networks essential within these bundles.", "On top of our sports commitment, we intend to double our spending on original programming over the next several years. So in total, we expect to grow our annual programming investment at Turner to over $5 billion within the next several years.", "Our commitment is also clear in products like CNN Go, which we recently launched, and is perhaps the most advanced TV Everywhere product yet developed.", "Similarly, Turner's leading the charge in providing in-season stacking rights to our distributors and consumers when many of our peers have been reticent to do so.", "At HBO, we're equally committed to working with our distribution partners to grow our mutual business. Where others have cut back on their investments to drive margins, HBO has been investing aggressively in original programming, and it's extended its film output deals to maintain the very best selection of recent Hollywood hit. And HBO GO is the gold standard TV Everywhere product for the industry.", "At the same time, we can't ignore the growing opportunity outside the ecosystem. So we'll be investing there as well. I already mentioned our plans to expand the reach of HBO to consumers who are not currently multichannel subscribers, and we'll be working very closely with our current distribution partners in that area. We think that's a big opportunity.", "We are also thrilled with the performance of CNN.com, which in September surpassed Yahoo! News to become the most consumed news and information website in the United States, as measured by both page views and video starts.", "At Warner's, we recently created a new division, Blue Ribbon Content, to focus on short-form digital content. Its initial lineup consists of both original concepts and DC-based content, including an innovative virtual reality experience produced for the Samsung GALAXY Gear VR and Oculus Rift that will take you inside the bat cave. That's exactly the type of innovative storytelling that will allow Warner Bros. to remain at the forefront of the industry as consumer viewing habits continue to evolve.", "When we talk about pursuing opportunities outside the ecosystem, I think there's an important point to keep in mind. If you look back over the past decade, we've seen the introduction of all kinds of new platforms and services for video, including iTunes, YouTube and SVOD offerings from Hulu, Netflix and Amazon. And what we've seen, both outside the system and inside it, through services like our own VOD and our own TV Everywhere product, is that the more options you give audiences to access video content, the greater the consumption. Rather than merely shifting share from one platform to another, we continue to see growth in the video universe. And that's why we're convinced we can effectively pursue growth in both areas.", "Now before I turn it over to Howard, I want to say, again, how confident we are in Time Warner's position. We're proud of our track record of industry-leading EPS growth and shareholder returns over the past 5-plus years.", "We're really just getting started. The best video content is growing in value and we occupy the perfect position in the value chain to benefit from that.", "And so while there are risks, we're confident we can mitigate them. We have an industry-leading collection of must-have networks, we have unmatched film and TV production capabilities, we have leading global brands and we're investing in the very best programming to capitalize on growth across all distribution platforms, both within the traditional ecosystem and outside of it. All of that gives us great confidence in the financial plan we presented last month, in the upside opportunities we discussed and in our ability to continue delivering industry-leading shareholder returns.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Howard.", "Howard M. Averill", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.", "We're really pleased with our performance so far this year and the progress we're making toward the longer-term targets we discussed with you last month. While there were a number of moving pieces in the quarter, on the whole, our results were a little better than we expected, and that included a further acceleration and subscription revenue growth at both Turner and HBO.", "Before I go to our divisional results, I'd like to address the restructuring, severance and programming charges and tax matter that we outlined at our investor meeting 3 weeks ago.", "We will take over $400 million in restructuring and severance charges in the second half of this year. About $300 million of that was recognized in the third quarter. The charges reflect our company-wide focus on efficiency and stem from global reviews of our businesses by the new CEOs at each of our divisions.", "We previously discussed with you the importance of constraining non-programming costs, and this is a reflection of our commitment to that goal. We expect to generate annual savings from our restructuring actions of around $450 million over time, with much of it coming in 2015. That will allow us to invest even more in great content and help position us for future growth across the company.", "Additionally, Turner decided to stop airing certain programming that no longer fit the brand promise of its networks. As a result, Turner incurred a significant programming charge this quarter. Since some of the programming was licensed from Warner Bros., the net impact to the company after accounting for intercompany eliminations was $343 million.", "More than offsetting these items on an after-tax basis was a $639 million net benefit resulting from tax matters primarily as a result of a federal tax settlement.", "Given their nature and size, my comments throughout the presentation will largely focus on results excluding these 3 items.", "So excluding them, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.97, and that benefited from our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion in shares, and year-to-date, we bought back close to $4.9 billion of our stock. Combined with paying close to $850 million in dividends, that means we have returned over $5.7 billion of capital to shareholders so far this year, and that's after investing more than $10 billion in programming, production and related marketing. So we're continuing to invest aggressively in our businesses, while providing significant direct returns to shareholders.", "This morning, we increased our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance to high teens growth, which includes an estimated net benefit of around $0.15 from the reversal of tax reserves and the programming, restructuring and severance charges in the third and fourth quarters. So we're firmly on track for our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth and adjusted EPS. And I'll touch on that in more detail later in the presentation.", "Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll begin at Turner, where we continue to see strong subscription revenue growth. Subscription revenues increased 10% in the quarter, an acceleration from the second quarter, and that included a pickup in growth at both our domestic and international businesses.", "International subscription revenue increased in the low double digits, primarily due to positive trends in Latin America.", "Domestic subscription revenue growth remains very healthy and was, again, in the high single digits, as Turner continues to benefit from the rate increases associated with its domestic affiliate renewals. And as we look out over the next several years, we expect subscription revenue to remain a key driver of growth at Turner.", "Moving on. Advertising revenue declined just under 2%, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. Domestic advertising was essentially flat, and that included a low single-digit decline in domestic entertainment, including young adults, which was offset by solid growth at news.", "While our original programming at TNT performed well over the summer, ratings at our domestic networks have remained a headwind, and scatter demand in the quarter remained moderate.", "International advertising was down in the quarter, partly due to adjustments impacting year-over-year comparability and FX. Excluding those factors, international advertising declined in the mid-single digits, and that was largely a result of somewhat lower demand in Latin America following the World Cup.", "In the fourth quarter, scatter pricing has been pacing up high single to low double digits over the upfront, while volume has remained relatively modest. With that backdrop, we anticipate total advertising revenues to be about flat in the quarter, and that includes a drag of about 500 basis points as a result of fewer Major League Baseball playoff games, the strengthening U.S. dollar and DISH pulling down certain of our networks. Without those, we would have anticipated a return to growth in the quarter.", "Excluding the programming and restructuring charges in each period, adjusted operating income would have grown modestly. That reflects healthy revenue growth and our continued focus on limiting non-programming expenses.", "Excluding those charges, programming cost increased in the low double digits due to the new MLB deal and the airing of additional original episodes.", "Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect very healthy underlying trends and subscription revenues and have easier comparisons on the programming cost side due to impairments in the year-ago period. And depending on its length, those will be offset either modestly or to a more significant degree by our DISH dispute.", "Looking beyond 2014, we anticipate the restructuring efforts this year to result in over $200 million in annual savings at Turner, with a majority of those savings starting in 2015. Those savings will help fund aggressive investments in programming while allowing for sustainable margin expansion. And combined with what we expect to be accelerating subscription revenue growth in 2016 and beyond, we plan to deliver very strong growth and adjusted operating income for the next several years.", "Turning now to HBO, where we continue to have very good operating momentum. Subscription revenues increased 10% in the quarter with the consolidation of HBO Asia contributing about 400 basis points to that growth.", "As we discussed with you at our Investor Day, domestic sub-trends remained very healthy, with HBO on track for its best year in almost 2 decades.", "And combined with some improvement in the subscriber mix, that resulted in a modest acceleration in domestic subscription revenue growth in the quarter.", "As a reminder, we have now fully lapped the consolidation of both HBO Nordic and HBO Asia, so subscription revenue growth should return to a more normal level in the fourth quarter.", "Content revenues grew 7%, and that was driven by increased international licensing revenues and strong home video sales. Those factors more than offset lower domestic syndication sales.", "In the quarter, we recognized $48 million of restructuring charges related to the company-wide efforts I discussed at the start of my presentation. Excluding restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have grown modestly in the quarter.", "Programming expense growth included 600 basis points from the consolidation of HBO Asia.", "Looking through that, programming expenses increased 10%, driven by mid-teens growth in original programming as a result of spending on new series, including The Leftovers and The Net.", "HBO's international operations posted another quarter of solid growth, with total revenue, including unconsolidated JVs, increasing double digits. And that included growth in both licensing and our networks businesses, which continue to benefit from robust sub-growth, especially in Latin America.", "Looking after the fourth quarter, we anticipate continued solid growth in subscription revenues.", "At the same time, programming expenses should grow in the mid-teens, primarily due to the timing of theatrical expenses.", "But given the strong year-to-date results and very healthy underlying trends, HBO remains on track for another year of solid growth in adjusted OI. And we think HBO is well-positioned to grow at even more attractive rates for the next several years.", "Moving on to Warner Bros., where we're benefiting from increased global demand for our content, and are on track for another very good year despite difficult theatrical comparisons in the third and fourth quarters.", "Looking specifically at the third quarter, and excluding restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have fallen 6%, and that included both the benefit from a patent license and settlement agreement as well as a drag from a onetime VAT catch-up. Theatrically, our lineup was not as strong as the year ago when we released The Conjuring and We\u2019re the Millers and the carryover revenue from Man of Steel, but the fourth quarter got off to a great start with Annabelle, and we're excited about our upcoming releases, which include the international opening of Interstellar this week as well as the final installment of the Hobbit and American Sniper next month. And longer term, we think we have the strongest slate in the history of the company.", "So overall, we feel really good about the outlook for our theatrical business.", "On the TV side, demand for our product remains robust with revenues growing high single digits in the quarter. That included growth in SVOD revenue and increased TV production, including the consolidation of Eyeworks.", "Across theatrical and TV, Home Entertainment revenue was stable in the quarter. And digital trends remain very positive, with electronics sell-through growing over 50%.", "Looking at the fourth quarter, Warner Bros. will incur additional restructuring charges of around $100 million.", "In addition, we face difficult home video and theatrical comparisons. Recall that last year's fourth quarter set a record for Warner Bros. as it benefited from the home video releases of Man of Steel, Pacific Rim and The Hangover Part III as well as the theatrical release of Gravity.", "But if not for the restructuring charges I just noted, Warner's would be on track for record year. And the global demand increasing for the high-quality content that Warner Bros. specializes in, we're confident we can grow the business at very attractive levels for the foreseeable future.", "Turning to free cash flow, which also remains healthy, we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow year-to-date similar to year-ago levels, and that's despite a material increase in cash taxes due principally to the expiration of certain favorable tax legislation.", "As you can see on the slide, we've broken out the programming, restructuring and severance charges incurred in the third quarter, which had a significant impact on adjusted operating income. It's worth noting that the majority of severance payments related to the restructurings will come in 2015. Cutting through the noise, we're on track for another year of healthy free cash flow generation in 2014, and we expect to continue converting a very high percentage of our earnings into free cash flow in the years to come.", "Now on to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $19.3 billion of net debt. That's up over $1 billion versus the end of 2013, and that's primarily due to our commitment to direct shareholder returns.", "During the first 9 months, we returned $5.3 billion to shareholders, including almost $4.5 billion in share repurchases. And we continue to think our stock is very attractive at these levels.", "On the M&A front, we've invested about $880 million year-to-date. A majority of this came in the second quarter as we closed our acquisition of Eyeworks international television operations and completed financing arrangements with CME.", "Due to the programming, restructuring and severance charges in the third quarter, our net leverage ratio was 2.9x as of September 30. However, excluding those charges, our net leverage ratio would have been 2.6x.", "On that basis, we're on track to reach our target net leverage ratio of 2.75x by the end of the year.", "And as we said last month, we remain committed to maintaining our solid investment-grade credit rating.", "Now onto the final slide, which shows our 2014 outlook. This morning, we raised our full year 2014 outlook to high teens adjusted EPS growth. Our outlook includes a net benefit of approximately $0.15 from the tax matters and programming, restructurings and severance charges I noted earlier. One item that could impact our result is our current carriage dispute with DISH. And as I noted before, DISH has unilaterally dropped a number of our networks.", "Furthermore, our contracts for TNT and TBS expire soon. We're working hard to reach a new agreement in the near future, but if we're not able to, our adjusted EPS would likely come in toward the lower end of the range I just provided.", "Excluding the $0.15 net benefit I just mentioned and any potential impact from DISH, we would still be tracking ahead of the outlook we have provided in August. And that's despite the significant 4Q programming investments at HBO and difficult 4Q comparisons at Warner Bros.", "So we're pleased with our performance this year, and the investments we're making in high-quality video content put us in a great position to deliver the double-digit CAGR and adjusted OI and over $8 in adjusted EPS by 2018 that we discussed with you last month.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Howard. Janette, if we could go ahead and open up the line? [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities.", "Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions on programming at Turner. First, with respect to the size of the content write-off, it's pretty substantial relative to, let's say, the cost of an individual episode of programming. Can you provide more color on what was included in the write-off and how it affects sort of your investment on programming going forward? And then second of all, you recently announced the hiring of Kevin Reilly as the Head of TBS and TNT. Can you talk a bit about why he's the right person and how that affects the investment there?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I'll take that. Mike, I think as you may all remember, when we started this, we've got all the CEOs here. So John's here and I think it's probably better for you to start, John.", "John K. Martin", "All right, thanks. Good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. Listen, and I think Howard said this in his proactive remarks, that the charge that we took was a portfolio of programming that no longer fits the brand direction that we want to take each of TNT and TBS in. But the biggest components included The Mentalist and a number of shows that we had historically with the relationship with Tyler Perry, including House of Pain. And that is going to allow us to better program the network with series that better fit the evolving brands. In terms of the impact that it's going to have on overall investment levels going forward, as I said at the recent analyst meeting, our intention and expectation is to contain overall programming costs at Turner to be no more than high single digits over several years on an annual basis. And we have every confidence that we can do it. But I want to make sure I want to pause for a second because I don't want people to believe that acquired programming no longer has a place on our networks. I think the only change in our view of acquired is that we need to be more selective, which is similar to our strategy with originals, by the way, as we'll look to get -- to become more distinctive in our programming, and over time, targeting a younger audience, particularly on TNT. But acquired can still play an important role for the foreseeable future, and all you need to look at is the big, big hits like Big Bang Theory, which is going to have a place in prime time for the foreseeable future. So that answers that question, and thank you for mentioning the hiring of Kevin, which we announced yesterday. And speaking on behalf of David Levy, who is the Direct Hiring Manager and myself, we couldn't be more thrilled that Kevin's going to be coming over to join us here at Turner. I mean, he is absolutely one of the most respected, innovative and influential executives in this industry, and he's always been a champion of quality television, who does not shy away from taking bold programming risks. And we've carved out and created a new role for him because of his unique tastes, experience and his creative relationships. He'll have the title, Chief Creative Officer, which will allow him to work with and lead the Turner creative executives and finding new ways to reach viewers with programming that plays to the strength of our various brands and platforms. So really, really thrilled.", "Richard R. Plepler", "Yes, John. Michael, it's Richard. I'll just punctuate that. I mean, Kevin enjoys a truly stellar reputation in Hollywood. And my emails yesterday were plentiful with people from the community just saying, bravo to our cousins at Turner's for making that hire. I think it's a very smart creative choice, and he's going to do great things there.", "Kevin Tsujihara", "Warner Bros. has -- this is Kevin. Warner Bros. has a fantastic relationship with Kevin that goes back a long way. And as Richard said, the creative community response has been tremendous regarding this hire. So we're really excited about it.", "Howard M. Averill", "Mike, this is Howard. I just wanted to come back. Mike, this is Howard. I just wanted to come back and just reiterate the fact that on a net basis, the programming impairment is $343 million, which is consistent with what I outlined at the Investor Day. The decision was a jump point. It was really about making the most in programming so that we could move faster. We don't expect to have any significant savings over the term or the long range plan on that.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen of Bank of America.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "It's great that you have the division guys on, so we'll take advantage of that. One for John and one for Richard. So on the DISH dispute, which you guys brought up a few times, I'm just wondering, you said it might affect Q4 -- or Howard said it might affect Q4 earnings. But John, how do you -- how should we think about this over the longer term given the guidance you've given for affiliate fee growth of low double digits? And for Richard, I just want to ask about the broadband opportunity, which Jeff just highlighted. Do you see that -- and you've obviously discussed it at the Analyst Day, but do you see the standalone broadband opportunity as a bigger potential opportunity for HBO than simply driving performance from the poorer-performing pay-TV operators to like the mid or upper level? Like which one is the bigger opportunity?", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jessica, it's John. I'll start. Listen, I mean, ordinarily, we wouldn't be in the practice of commenting publicly as it relates to what's a private business dispute. But given Charlie Ergen's comments on the earnings call yesterday, I just want to provide a little bit of context from our perspective. And it think it's fair to say that we disagree with virtually everything he said as it related to the importance of our product, as it related to his platform. We were both disappointed in the very antagonistic and aggressive nature of his comments yesterday, and we're disappointed particularly given the fact that DISH had previously agreed to our network's rates and our carriage proposals weeks ago. And we were working hard to get a deal done. We were supportive, in fact, unclear now, of additional TT efforts, and we have found common ground on virtually all of the major issues there. So while there clearly were more deal points to get done, they are not of the type of nature that would result in networks going dark. And I think all of us sitting around the table have been in this industry a long time, so we have a pretty good sense of what those are. So to us, it's unclear exactly what the dispute with DISH is, and we were told by them that we were taken down because we wouldn't move an expiration date later into the year. What's kind of interesting about that is it was an expiration date for networks that aren't even up yet. And it's important to note that other top five U.S. distributors have signed up for the deal that DISH has now walked away from. And look, we're confident in our brands. The value of the Turner news, entertainment, kids and young adult brands and the content that we have are reflected in the leadership positions that we have across the media landscape. And we have 2 of the top 5, 3 of the top 10 and 5 of the top 30 cable networks. We're the only programming group that has that. And CNN is #2 in ratings, #1 in reach and it has the most innovative TV everywhere product available on the market. So we honestly have no idea what DISH was talking about yesterday. Having said all of that, Turner's had a long-term relationship with DISH that has been to a mutual benefit. And that's one of the reasons that we agree to multiple calendar extensions during this lengthy negotiation process, and we worked diligently and in good faith to try to address what those issues are. In fact, we even stayed at the table after DISH removed our networks from their service. And look, we believe in our brands and we're willing to work constructively to get a deal done in the near term.", "Howard M. Averill", "So Jessica, just to get your point about the impact on guidance, we still expect we'll reach a deal. So we don't expect this is going to impact our long-term guidance.", "Richard R. Plepler", "Jessica, yes, Richard -- Jessica, I'm going to answer your broadband-only question. So look, first of all, as I think I said on Investor, this is not binary, it is not one of the others, it's multilateral. We're going to go first after the enormous opportunity that I spoke about in 70 million homes that do not get HBO in the MVPD universe. We think, as I've told you, there's 10 to 15 million persuadable homes. We want to work with our partners to attack that market aggressively. And in the broadband-only universe, we think there's 4 million to 5 million also working with our partners. So to us, this is just net upside everywhere, margin upside everywhere. I talked to all of our distributors about it. We want to lean in with them early in the new year, begin working on the plans for this for 2015. And I see nothing but upside for us, nothing but upside for the consumer, nothing but upside for our distributors.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Janedis of Jefferies.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "John, you mentioned syndication earlier. As content has become available in more platforms, there is a view in the market that it's weighing on syndication broadly. So can you tell us what you're seeing globally in syndication, and to what extent you're seeing either inflation or deflation in license fees?", "Kevin Tsujihara", "This is Kevin from Warner Bros. I think that what we're continuing to see is on a global basis, demand for our product and the pricing for our product continues to go up. And as John said, the programming that -- the hit programming that continues to kind of dominate the airwaves today is the programming that you're seeing the most pricing power on. And so -- but international markets are very strong right now, and we continue to -- we expect to continue to see that in the foreseeable future.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe just going back, John, to this question maybe. Just going forward, it seems like distributors are appreciatingly focusing on ratings when negotiating fees. And so how relevant are ratings in your view? And is this argument missing viewers and platforms that aren't -- but will be measured someday?", "John K. Martin", "Yes. I mean, look, and I noticed from my experience on this side being a programmer, I also know from my experience having worked at Time Warner Cable for a number of years. Ratings are one measurement, but there is not a particularly strong correlation between ratings and affiliate fees because what's more important than ratings is the brand affinity and the passion engagement that subscribers have with particular branded environments and networks. And so you can have a network that has lower ratings, but has a subset of fans, like Turner Classic Movies, for example, that are incredibly passionate about a particular network. Those networks can command a premium and affiliate fees because the distributors value that relationship with the consumer. And so I don't want to say that ratings are unimportant because obviously, higher-rated networks mean that viewers are spending more and more time with them. But it's only one of a number of a variety of factors that determines what clears the affiliate fee price in the marketplace.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I just want to add, the classic example of that is sports.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "You guys talked about sort of moving into new areas and at the same time, supporting the ecosystem. And you highlighted the NBA, Jeff. There's a lot out there about the NBA looking to go over the top. Adam Silver did an interview talking about an urgency to do that soon. And I think ESPN has at least hinted at the idea of doing something as well. How does NBA, ESPN over-the-top fit into your worldview? And how does Turner participate or not participate in that opportunity?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "I'm going to give it to John to ask him about Turner.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, thanks. To a large extent, as you add more opportunities for consumers to see things on demand, that's probably a good thing to strengthen their attachment and engagement with the brands. And most of their -- most of the consumers' increasing excitement with, engagement, time spent every day goes across a number of channels that they watch on demand on their television, and then it they want to leave the house they can watch it on a mobile device. And so I think what you're seeing here is really an increase in the value of having these networks and having a lot of them on, on demand basis. But I'll give -- John, you can talk about the specifics of the...", "John K. Martin", "Thanks, Jeff. I mean, further to what Jeff just said, listen, we're supportive of the relationship between the NBA and ESPN as it relates to this OTT package, but I do think it's very important to understand what it is and what it is not. The OTT package is very targeted. It's a mobile product with select out-of-market games. It won't include any of the games that air on our networks. Those are exclusive to us and include our own digital rights with respect to those, and it wont's include any playoff games. So it doesn't impact the package that we have with the NBA at all. We still have the same package of exclusive Thursday night games. In fact, we got 12 additional games. And as I mentioned, we maintain all streaming rights there. We already partner with the NBA on an OTT call offering. It's called NBA League Pass, and we're continuing to manage the NBA's digital properties, and we partner on NBA TV. And lastly, I would mention, we also got increased digital rights for Bleacher Report, which is the #2 sports destination now in the U.S. So there were plenty of digital rights that were spread around, and we think it's good for the NBA. We think they were very smart the way that we're approaching, that they've approached it. And I think it's going to work out well for all 3 parties, us, ESPN and the NBA.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And can I ask Kevin a follow-up along the same lines around the ecosystem with Gotham? Kevin, can you talk about that deal, why that was the right deal for Warner with Netflix? You mentioned full seasons stacking and Fox does not have stacking rights for that show. So it went in a different direction. Why was that the right path for Warner and Time Warner on that property?", "Kevin Tsujihara", "It was the right deal for that particular show at that moment in time. I think that as we look more broadly at stacking, we believe that stacking rights are very much important to be part of the overall TV Everywhere experience, and that you can make that argument that by allowing cable networks and broadcast networks to stack our program, it actually increases the value, of the long-term value of the content. It increases the amount of sampling of a show. If you look at something like Gotham and if you add all the viewing, and I think Fox just reported this, if you take out live plus same day, you add the 7-day DVR, you add the days 4 plus, you're now looking at a P2-plus number of 22 million viewers. That kind of viewing when cum'd like that, that would put in a top 10 show 10 years ago. So I think we need to look at these kinds of things differently. We need to obviously figure out ways to monetize that audience more effectively, but it does kind of show the value of product and the fact that viewing is happening in many different ways today, and we just have to catch up in the way we measure it and we monetize it.", "John K. Martin", "It's John. We couldn't agree more. I mean, the same thing on Last Ship, where half of the viewing was non-live. Falling Skies, the same thing; Legends, significant increase. All of these shows, well Last Ship and Falling Skies were stacked, and we saw significant catch-up viewing deep into the season. So this -- we think the industry who is not granting stacking is looking at this the wrong way. This is about creating hits and the ability for consumers to find shows and to make it convenient for them, increases their discovery and their willingness to view shows. So at Turner, we have a deal with Warner's. And really, really couldn't be more pleased with Kevin's support and team's support of Warner's. We're going to be looking to stack all of our originals.", "Howard M. Averill", "Richard talk about -- I mean, HBO basically stacks our originals. So it's selling something.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "But I've said this before. If you just take Thrones or True Detective or as an example, on Sunday night itself, we're doing probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% or 30% viewing. And then on demand, it is doing another 60%. And then you have HBO GO. So even a show as popular as Thrones or True Detective is doing 75%, 80% if it's viewing on non-premiere nights. And for us, obviously, making show available when the consumer wants and how they want it is how we cume up the numbers as high as 19.5 million for Thrones, 13 million for True Detective. John Oliver, or Bill Maher cuming over 4 million, same viewing patterns.", "Unknown Executive", "So we -- this is more evidence that the TV Everywhere basically, including all networks on demand, and having it available on your television is what the ecosystem should do, it's what cable and telcos should offer, it's what networks should grant for their current year seasons. You can see it. It's as clear as a 5-lane highway. So let's get everybody out there on how to get it done.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Can you provide a bit more color on the upside in HBO subscriber growth domestically in the quarter? I guess, was it driven by more favorable terms with some of your distributors, more aggressive marketing? I guess, any color behind that? And if we should expect it to continue to the fourth quarter?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Yes, I think we have better performing distributors in Time Warner Cable and some of our others. And as I made clear, you have a vast disparity and penetration, as low as 14 and as high as 42. So we'll work very hard on this year getting some of our lower penetrating distributors up. That happened. We've seen nothing but a real upside on that going forward. And again, as I've talked about the data that makes clear how many persuadable homes there are out there, we are now taking all of that inside our distributors, breaking it down for them and making clear how much upside opportunity is available to them. The response, as I said on Investor Day, has been extremely enthusiastic. So we believe we're going to see all of those distributors leaning into that possibility going forward.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And just a follow-up, if I can, on Turner. Can you talk about the difference that you're seeing particularly now with a bit more volatility in the ad market between the demand and maybe pricing for sports programming versus general entertainment?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Sure. Right now, we're doing really, really well with the NBA. And so relative to general entertainment, which is probably a better proxy for the broader market, I'd say sports is stronger. And just to repeat what Howard said, we're doing fine in terms of pricing in the scatter market. There just isn't the type of volume that we would like in an ideal world, but sports for us is working quite well.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Would you say the volume deteriorated in October or is it about the same?", "Howard M. Averill", "I didn't hear the question.", "John K. Martin", "No, there hasn't been a demonstrable trends line difference in volume.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of Nathanson.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "I have one for John and Jeff, one for Kevin, which I want to take, if you can. In answering the DISH question, you did bring up that personal streaming service and you're positive about it. So can you walk us through the parameters of that deal? And what gives you comfort that signing up with a personal streaming service won't impact the 90 million homes that are paying for a bigger bundle?", "Kevin Tsujihara", "Well, yes, I mean, I mentioned it. I mean, look, we don't have a deal with them. So we -- and I think we've been fairly consistent, Michael, in our view of OTT and -- or what were called virtual MVPDs. What's important for us and what would make us support a service like this would be to get the networks that are leading networks into those packages. And I'll go back to what I said at the Analyst Day, we've got virtually all of our economics in our top 4 or 5 networks. And we don't have that many networks that are niche, that are small, that don't much in terms of ratings that aren't that important. And so we would anticipate, as over time, if bundles get smaller, we would be able to protect and hopefully, even expand as these services will appeal to a greater level of audience, our overall appeal and overall number of consumers that we can get in front of.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "So John, are there conditions on the size of the number of networks in that streaming bundle that you had to work with?", "John K. Martin", "That's a question for DISH, not for us.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay. And let me ask one for Kevin. Kevin, when answering the stacking rights questions, John and Richard both said, how important stacking rights are to their in the networks. And a lot of times, they mentioned their original content that they've stacked. I wonder, going forward, given the Gotham example, do you think your role as independent producer for broadcasters may change because networks want to may -- control more of their stacking rights and own more of those rights themselves? So how do you see that evolving at a broadcast level?", "Kevin Tsujihara", "I think the trend will be increased rights granted to networks in stacking. And as John mentioned, we reached an agreement between ourselves to grant those rights to Turner. And I think that as a company, we believe that there isn't an impact on long-term rights related to these kinds of stacking. And I think that therefore, you're going to see, on a go-forward basis, a more consistent grant of rights that is broader.", "John K. Martin", "Then just one quick further thing. The other thing I just want to mention, too, is that, I mean, our goal and expectation at TNT and TBS is we're going to own more of our originals. And when I say own more, that's Turner and Warner's, and Warner's being our most important studio partners. So we are going to make whatever the right decisions are to increase the probability of success for the shows that we air on our network. And obviously, right now, you can hear a unified approach that stacking is going to help the shows.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up, I guess, for Kevin and Jeff on the stacking right question. When you look at the value chain then between what you're doing with Turner in selling full stacking rights for those originals and then looking at the monetization outside of the Turner platform, frankly, like how much more do the Turner nets have to pay for those rights? And do they make them less valuable in the actual deals you're doing now with SVOD distributors? Like is the money more or is it less or is it the same?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes", "Look, I'm going to start, and let's go global here. You're talking about an evolution of the rights and windows for shows. And so I think the way to think about it is if the norm becomes that all television networks, when you go to whatever network you want to see your show on, and you know that you can watch any episode of the current season on demand, and you can do it on your television stream, you can do it on a broadband-delivered VOD service, what we're talking about here is taking television and making it VOD universal. Therefore, it would not have an effect on really the discrete change and the price of the show. And as Kevin said earlier, the -- when you do that, and you make the show easier to get attached and engaged and follow, you have actually a more valuable show in subsequent seasons and on later windows. So that's basically what's going to happen in the industry. If you focus too much on any particular deal in the transition period of going from rolling 5 to a full season, I think you'd be missing where this is going. The net effect of the whole thing is to have TV networks become more valuable and more powerful to have the value of any hit show become more valuable, and to then create basically evolution of the windows, where anything in a current season, you know it's on demand, doesn't matter what network you're watching. That's how we see the change in the definition of a television network. You can watch once a day. That works exactly like that, it's called Home Box Office. So just watch HBO. It's been doing that for years. You can -- Showtime now does it, too. You can see exactly how powerful that is. It makes all the networks more valuable, and it makes all the shows more valuable.", "Kevin Tsujihara", "Yes. And I think the only thing I would add is the key thing is the consistency. But you don't have to guess whether all those shows are going to be stacked on HBO or not, and I think we've got to get to a place where there's more consistency on the rights granted.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "A question for Richard, and then maybe a follow-up for Howard. On the Comcast-NBCUniversal calls, Steve Burke said about the HBO TT product. He said, \"I think it's going to challenging for HBO to go and try and attract new customers into this ecosystem without cannibalizing existing customers.\" I think you've been clear, Richard, that you don't think that will happen. Presumably, you'll be working with your traditional MVPD partners. I guess, the question is, if you have enough success with your partners on Internet Plus-type offerings, as you described, would you revisit your decision to roll out a standalone OTT product after that sequencing?", "Richard R. Plepler", "The answer to the last question is no. Let me go to the first, which is Steve. Steve called me personally to give some context to the comment, number one, and I think it was somewhat overreported, if you will. Neil called subsequently and I spoke to him and I think the real point is the one that Neil made in The Wall Street Journal, with namely that HBO and Comcast have been terrific partners. He expects us to be terrific partners going forward. I couldn't echo that more enthusiastically. So we're going to work very closely with them on our current business. We're going to look -- work very closely with them growing it not only in their current video business, but also on the broadband-only and Internet Plus side. And if you have any doubt that we're each -- helping each other to grow each other's business, just look at the performance, and look at 2015 and -- '14 and I think '15 portends even greater growth.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then one quick one for Howard. You mentioned you continue to track a little bit ahead of the full year earnings guidance that you had provided earlier in the year. If I flow through the third quarter beat and then the tax benefit, it does seem like the fourth quarter comes down a little bit. You called out, Howard, a few of those factors, programming, investments at HBO, comps at Warner, the DISH dispute and then the advertising expectation at Turner, how am I doing on those factors? And then maybe as a way, you can sort of rank those in terms of their impact on the 4Q.", "Howard M. Averill", "Your underlying assumption about us not looking as good if you take those things out is actually not correct. When I indicated it, if you exclude the restructuring and tax and the program impairment, we're tracking a little bit better than our prior guidance that we gave in August. And what was the question in terms of the ranking of ...", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Well, maybe another way to ask it would be specifically on Turner advertising, so I think you talked about flat. Was that where you had expected the fourth quarter Turner ad growth, for example, going into this part of the year? Or had you expected a growth for the fourth quarter Turner advertising?", "Howard M. Averill", "Anthony, there's a lot of puts and takes. I'm not going to go into the details of evolving individual components of that. But we are -- but financially, we continue to track well, as I indicated.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Anthony, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact me or Michael Senno. Have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Joe and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full year and the other providing our 2015 full year business outlook. Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover.", "First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.", "Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "I will now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara will join us for a Q&A session. Jeff?", "Jeff Bewkes", "Thanks, Mike and thanks for listening in this morning. 2014 was another year of strong financial performance for our company with solid revenue growth and 18% growth in adjusted EPS. That's our sixth straight year of at least high-teens adjusted EPS growth and it's consistent with our plan to reach close to $6 in adjusted EPS in 2016 and over $8 in 2018.", "We also grew free cash flow by 12% to $3.5 billion and we returned more than $6.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends and as we announced this morning, we anticipate another year of very good growth in adjusted EPS in 2015. We're also committed to building on our strong record of providing direct returns to shareholders which have totaled more than $26 billion since 2008. You can see evidence of this commitment in the 10% increase in our dividend approved by our Board. That is also the sixth straight year we have raised the dividend by double digits.", "So we expect another great year in 2015 and that is in the context of an industry where, like all of you, we see the pace of change accelerating. Consumers' appetite for high-quality video content is increasing globally, but we're in the midst of a secular shift to on-demand consumption. At the same time, advertisers' expectations for data analytics and targeting are also increasing.", "These changes create new challenges for our industry, but we think they are also creating big opportunities for the producers of the very best video content. In fact, we've spent the last several years positioning ourselves to take advantage of these trends. In 2014, we've completed our transformation into a more focused, nimble and collaborative video content company that takes better advantage of our leading brands and our global scale at Warner Bros., Turner and HBO.", "We also finished the transition to a new generation of CEOs at each of our divisions and we continued to invest even more in the very best content. In 2014 we invested $14.5 billion in programming, production and marketing. That's up about $3 billion compared to just five years earlier and we expect that to grow to around $19 billion a year over the next several years.", "That investment is going into increased original programming at HBO and Turner, into high-profile sports like the NBA, NCAA March madness and major league baseball; and also into the biggest film and TV franchises at Warners. And those investments will continue to pay dividends in the years to come as the demand for high-quality on-demand video content grows.", "We also continue to invest resources in improving the user experience in order to increase the value we're providing to our distribution partners and to consumers of multichannel television. Last year we launched CNNgo, the most advanced multiplatform news product on the market. We expanded HBO GO to additional platforms including Amazon Fire, PS3 and Xbox One and we started to make stacking rights available for some of our biggest hits at Turner.", "At the same time, we're increasingly investing outside the traditional TV ecosystem to help ensure that consumers can access our great content wherever, whenever and on whatever device they choose, even if they don't have a conventional multichannel TV subscription. The most notable example is our HBO OTT service which we're on track to launch later this year. We think there is a big opportunity for us to reach broadband-only consumers and to reduce the friction of subscribing to HBO for multichannel subs that don't currently have the service.", "We look forward to sharing more details about the service closer to launch, but HBO's OTT product is only one element of our digital strategy. At Turner, CNN Digital grew both average monthly video streams and mobile uniques by more than 30% in 2014. And Turner's Bleacher Report averaged 39 million monthly unique visitors, becoming the number two digital sports destination in the U.S.", "We have carried that momentum into 2015. All five of Turner's most important networks were included in Dish's Sling TV service, making up more than a third of the channels at launch. CNN and Bleacher Report were two of Snapchat's launch partners for its Discover feature. And last month Warners announced that it will be launching an SVOD service in Southeast Asia in partnership with SingTel and Sony Pictures Television. That is another opportunity for Warners to use new distribution platforms to grow its business in Asia, where it already has a significant stake in Hollywood VIP. That is a rapidly-growing SVOD service in China which recently expanded its content offering to include HBO programming.", "You will also see us investing in our advertising business by rolling out advanced products that provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting they are coming to expect. We started that process last year when we began selling based on consumer behavior rather than just the traditional age and gender demographics. This year we're going to take that one step further.", "For the first time, we will have one joint upfront for all of our networks and we'll provide our best partners the ability to buy behavior-based inventory across all of our networks and digital platforms. We started talking to our partners about this at CES last month and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Combining the reach and quality environment of TV with the analytics in targeting digital is the holy-grail for advertisers and if we do that successfully, we think we can take share back from digital competitors over time.", "So clearly, there is a lot of change occurring in our industry, but we're more confident than ever in our position. That confidence stems from our belief that the very best video content is becoming more valuable to both consumers and to our advertising and distribution partners. We produce more of that great content than anybody which was evident once again in 2014.", "It is awards season, so let's start there. We received 13 Academy Award nominations this year including a best picture nomination for American Sniper. In true Warner Bros. fashion, this film has been both a commercial and a critical success. After opening in select theaters on Christmas Day, it shattered records when it went wide last month including the biggest January opening ever.", "Last year we also released the Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies which was the final installment of the epic trilogy by Peter Jackson. Through last week, the movie had brought in well over $900 million at the global box office and that brings the total for The Lord of the Rings franchise to close to $6 billion. That gives Warners two of the top four global film franchises in history including the biggest ever in Harry Potter.", "No one manages film franchises better than Warners and they are at the core of its film strategy going forward. Warners has laid out the most ambitious slate in its history which starting in 2016 will be built around DC Comics, LEGO and the world of Harry Potter. And we couldn't be more excited and confident in the opportunity it has, not only to drive growth at the box office, but also to significantly expand its ancillary business.", "None of that should overshadow Warners' continued leadership in television production. Warners has more than 60 series airing for the 2014 to 2015 season including the most primetime series on broadcast of any studio for the 11th time in the past 12 seasons. This season was particularly notable for Warners mining of the DC library which gave rise to two of this year's bona fide new hits, Gotham and The Flash and The Flash is just one of three DC shows on the CW with their presence helping the CW to broaden its audience and grow its ratings this season.", "DC is also a major driver of our games business including last year's release of LEGO Batman 3. That will continue in 2015 with the highly anticipated release of the final installment of the Batman: Arkham trilogy. Along with the release of Mortal Kombat X and a new mobile game based on Game of Thrones, that should propel Warners' give business to a record year in 2015.", "Now going back for a moment to the multiplex, last week HBO concluded a limited IMAX run for two episodes of its monster hit, Game of Thrones. That is HBO's most-watched series ever. It was the first television show to ever screen in an IMAX theater and that is a testament to the anticipation for Thrones' upcoming fifth season as well as to HBO's creative excellence.", "Last year HBO received 19 Primetime Emmys including five for True Detective, its most-watched freshman series ever and HBO's content superiority translated into close to 3 million additional domestic subscribers that is its highest growth in domestic subs in over three decades.", "In 2015, HBO plans to raise its game again with returning hits like True Detective, Veep, Silicon Valley, The Leftovers and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. As well as adding several new series like Westworld which is the second HBO drama produced by Warner Bros. and The Brick, a comedy series starring Tim Robbins and Jack Black and Ballers, starring Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.", "As we start this year we also have a lot of momentum at Turner. In 2014, TBS, TNT and Adult Swim claimed three of the top 10 spots in primetime among adults 18 to 49. TBS was the number two ad-supported cable network in prime time among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54. And TNT was home to six of the top 15 original series on ad-supported cable that is more than any other network and that included three new hits in The Last Ship, The Librarians and Murder in the First. That is strong evidence that its emphasis on more distinctive original programming is starting to work.", "2014 was also an important year for our sports business with Turner extending its partnership with the NBA through 2025 and kicking off its new agreement with Major League Baseball. We dipped our toe into the water with sports internationally by obtaining the UEFA Champions League rights in Brazil which will cement the must-have status of our recently acquired sports network, Esporte Interativo.", "Adult Swim continued to attract the largest audiences of young adults including the top two new shows among adults 18 to 34, Attack on Titan and Black Jesus. That is the type of programming that helped Adult Swim to be ranked as the number one ad-supported cable network in total day among adults 18 to 24 and 18 to 34 for the 10th consecutive year, as well as being the number one ad-supported table network in total day among adults 18 to 49.", "And the network it shares a channel with Cartoon Network, is on an absolute roll. In a year where most kids networks were down double digits, Cartoon grew its audience from kids 6 to 11 and we gained momentum through the year. In the fourth quarter, Cartoon grew ratings in its key demos by solid double digits and that is a trend that has continued into the first quarter of this year. Despite these successes, we know we can do better, in particular at TBS and TNT and we're confident that with new leadership in place and a focus on distinctive original programming, we will do better. The success of CNN is a great example of how the right management and the right programming strategy can drive growth, even in the face of challenging industry trends.", "In 2014, CNN grew its primetime rating in adults 25 to 54, while MSNBC registered double-digit declines and CNN had an average total day monthly reach of almost 77 million total viewers, the largest cumulative audience of any cable news network. CNN took share by going deeper on the biggest stores, revamping key day-parts like morning and expanding its innovative lineup of original primetime series based around talent like Anthony Bourdain, Morgan Spurlock, Lisa Ling and Mike Rowe.", "Its original programming also helped CNN draw by far the youngest median primetime audience among its cable news rivals and match its youngest on record. CNN's strong performance has continued into 2015 with its ratings in adults 25 to 54 up 70% in January, compared to double-digit declines for MSNBC. And CNN will look to build on that success by further expanding its lineup of originals this year.", "Developing a robust slate of must-have programming is a process that takes time but that is one of the things our company does best and we're confident in the team at Turner, their strategy and their ability to drive increased viewership across platforms as they execute on the plans they are putting in place.", "Before I turn it over to Howard, I want to emphasize that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute on the ambitious strategy and growth plans we shared with you last October. We're proud of our track record of industry-leading adjusted EPS growth and shareholder returns over the past five or six years.", "But 2015 is really our first full year as the new Time Warner and we're just getting underway. We're mindful of the challenges ahead of us, but we've done a lot of work to get to the right structure, the right management and the right strategy so that we're positioned to lead the industry and continue to deliver superior value to our shareholders.", "With that, let me turn it over to Howard.", "Howard Averill", "Thanks, Jeff and good morning. I will begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results, we're pleased with how we ended the year and the progress we're making on the long term targets we discussed at our investor day. As we look out over the next several years we continue to expect that solid revenue growth, attractive margin expansion and accelerating growth in adjusted OI will, on average, lead to high-teens growth in adjusted EPS.", "In 2014, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 18%, our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. That is in line with our updated guidance and exceeded the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, adjusted EPS included a net benefit of $0.10 from the tax matters and programming, restructuring and severance charges that we previously discussed with you.", "Including the additional restructuring and programming charges we took in the fourth quarter and net of intercompany eliminations, we incurred $469 million of restructuring and severance charges and $388 million of programming charges in the second half of 2014. We're expecting the restructuring actions to translate into run rate savings of close to $500 million, most of which will come in 2015. That will free up resources to invest even more in content and position us to accelerate our revenue growth in the coming years, while also continuing to expand margins.", "Those actions were consistent with our ongoing focus on expense management, excluding programming, restructuring and severance charges from both periods, total expenses increased only 3% from the year, despite our continued investments in great content. And about 100 basis points of that growth was due to the international consolidations at HBO and Warners' acquisition of Eyeworks. Total SG&A declined slightly for the year.", "We also had another strong year of cash flow which was up 12%. Free cash flow per share was up an even more impressive 19%, benefiting from our ongoing share repurchase program. In 2014 we repurchased $5.5 billion of our shares, a significant acceleration from the prior year. Combined with $1.1 billion in dividends, we returned $6.6 billion to shareholders during the year and as evidenced by the dividend increase we announced this morning, we remain committed to delivering significant direct returns to shareholders going forward.", "So we had another good year of financial performance in 2014 and returned a substantial amount of capital to shareholders, while also making great progress in positioning the company for strong growth in the years to come.", "I have one additional item to note regarding our 2014 results. One of our equity method investments is currently undergoing an international tax audit. If there are any material developments with this situation prior to the filing of our Form 10-K at the end of the month, we may be required to update our results to reflect their final 2014 earnings.", "Moving on, this morning we provided our outlook for 2015. We anticipate another year of very attractive growth with adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70 a share which implies mid-teens growth when excluding the $0.10 benefit to 2014 I noted earlier. So we expect good growth despite foreign currency swings that at current rates would result in a year-over-year drag of approximately $0.20 to $0.25 and we will do that as we continue to invest aggressively in content to position the company to accelerate revenue growth in 2016. I will provide additional context around our outlook as we go through the presentation.", "Now turning to the segment highlights. I will begin at Turner, where we ended 2014 with a record fourth quarter for revenues and adjusted operating income. Just as important, we continued to make progress in positioning Turner to accelerate growth over the next several years and beyond.", "Subscription revenues increased 5% for the quarter and 7% for the year and that included an FX headwind of close to 200 basis points in the quarter and approximately 100 basis points for the year. Without that international subscription revenue would have increased double digits for both periods due to continued positive trends in Latin America.", "Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single-digits in the fourth quarter, but excluding the impact from our dispute with Dish, domestic subscription revenues would have increased in the high single digits, similar to our growth for the full year and that reflected the positive impact of our current domestic renewal cycle. We anticipate completing new deals with the remainder of our top 10 affiliates by the end of this year which should drive very attractive growth in our subscription revenue over the next several years.", "Largely as a result of timing of those renewals and as we indicated to you in the past, we will not see the same benefit from domestic renewals in 2015 that we saw in 2014. At current rates we also expect headwinds of around 300 basis points from foreign currency movements including the move to the SICAD 2 rate in Venezuela. Taking into account those factors, we anticipate subscription revenue growth will slow materially this year before re-accelerating well into the double digits in 2016 and beyond.", "Moving on, advertising revenues declined 1% in 4Q, similar to our expectations coming into the quarter, but were up 1% for the year. The fourth quarter included a drag of close to 500 basis points as a result of airing fewer Major League Baseball playoff games, foreign currency movements and the impact from Dish. Absent those, ad revenue would've grown in the quarter. Domestic advertising declined modestly in the quarter and that included a decline in domestic entertainment including young adults which was partly offset by healthy growth at news, where we continued to benefit from positive ratings momentum and very strong trends in our digital business. Excluding the impact of FX, international advertising increased on the high single digits with growth across all regions.", "Looking to 2015, current rates imply about 200 basis point drag on advertising foreign currency movements including the move to the SICAD 2 rate in Venezuela. In the first quarter, we're seeing a modest improvement in the domestic environment. Scatter pricing is pacing up mid to high single digits over the upfront, while volume remains moderate. Putting all those factors together, we anticipate total advertising revenues to be about flat.", "Excluding programming and restructuring charges in both periods, adjusted operating income would have grown modestly in the quarter and 5% for the year and without those same charges, programming expenses increased 2% in the quarter and 7% for the year. That reflects our ongoing investments in both sports and original programming which we expect will generate attractive returns over the next several years.", "Looking through the charges I just discussed, we limited total expense growth to 4% in 2014 and that was a result of keeping SG&A costs flat, reflecting our commitment to tightly managing our non-programming expenses in order to direct additional resources to key programming. So in 2014 we continued to execute our plan at Turner and we feel we have laid the groundwork to expand margins and grow the business at very attractive rates over the next several years.", "Turning to HBO, where we had another year of solid growth in both revenues and adjusted operating income, subscription revenues were up 5% in the quarter and 8% for the year. The consolidations of HBO Asia and HBO Nordic contributed about 300 basis points to the full year growth. As a reminder, we had fully lapped both consolidations before the start of the fourth quarter.", "Domestically we had steady subscription revenue growth throughout the year. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO and Cinemax together added over 2.8 million domestic subscribers in 2014 that is the best domestic sub growth in over three decades. As we've previously discussed, most of these subscriber additions are non-revenue-generating. Still, we saw some improvement in the subscriber mix in 2014 which contributed to a modest acceleration in domestic subscription revenue growth and we expect a further acceleration in that growth over the next few years.", "Turning to content and other revenues which increased 14% in the quarter and 24% for the year that was boosted by a record year in home video led by sales of season three of Game of Thrones. HBO's licensing deal with Amazon also contributed to the strong full year results. Across HBO's international operations including unconsolidated JVs, we increased revenues double digits in 2014 and that included growth in both our licensing and networks business. International subscriber trends also remained strong, growing double digits across most regions. Sub growth was especially strong in Latin America and Europe in 2014.", "Adjusted operating income declined 5% in the quarter and that was largely due to the timing of theatrical expenses and investments in original programming which drove mid-teens growth in programming expenses. Marketing expenses were also higher in the quarter as we continued to invest in the brand.", "For the full year, programming costs were up in the high single digits when excluding the international consolidations. To help fund that investment, HBO remains focused on constraining non-programming expenses and excluding the international consolidations, we limited SG&A growth to 1% in 2014.", "Despite the drop in the fourth quarter and higher restructuring charges, adjusted operating income grew 7% for the year, so we had another year of solid growth and we continue the subscriber momentum we have had over the past few years, both domestically and internationally. Given the strong demand for the product globally, we feel very good about our ability to further accelerate growth over the next several years.", "Now on to Warner Bros. where excluding restructuring and severance charges, 2014 would have been another record year for adjusted operating income. And we achieved that thanks to continued growth in the TV business and our focus on cost containment. 2014 also benefited from a patent license and settlement agreement.", "On the TV side, revenues grew double digits in the fourth quarter capping off a great year. Internationally, Warners continues to benefit from the growing demand for high-quality TV content from both linear and SVOD buyers. We're also seeing growth in local production from Eyeworks acquisition we completed earlier in 2014 and domestically Warners remains the industry leader in primetime series produced for broadcast networks for the 2014-2015 TV Season. So the trends in TV production remain positive and we're confident we can continue to grow this business over the next several years.", "Theatrically coming into the year we knew we had tough comps, especially in the fourth quarter and that played out as expected with revenue declining for both the quarter and the year. But we're off to a terrific start in 2015 with the success of American Sniper and longer-term we think we have the strongest slate in the history of the company, so overall we feel really good about the outlook for our theatrical business.", "Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 12% for the year in part due to a softer slate. That was roughly in line with the overall market which was down 7% excluding SVOD, however we continued to see positive trends in digital across both theatrical and television product with electronic sell-through revenue up 40% for the year.", "On the expense side, consistent with our companywide focus on efficiency, Warner continues to tightly manage overhead costs. Excluding restructuring and severance charges from both periods, total expenses increased less than 2% and SG&A was down 4% for the year. As we head into 2015 we will start to see the benefit from the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter which we expect to contribute to margin expansion over time.", "So on the whole, Warners had a very good year and with our slate of franchise films starting in 2016 and the strong secular demand for high-quality TV content, we feel we're in a great position to grow Warners at attractive rates for the foreseeable future.", "Turning to the next slide, we had another year of strong free cash flow generation, growing free cash flow 12% to $3.5 billion. As can see on the slide, we've broken out the programming, restructuring and severance charges incurred in the second half of 2014 which had a significant impact on adjusted operating income. Our cash taxes increased primarily due to lower foreign tax credits. Cash interest increased as a result of the additional debt we issued during the year and the improvement in working capital was primarily due to lower participations at Warner Bros.", "Looking to 2015, keep in mind that we will have approximately $300 million of severance payments related to the restructuring actions we took this past year. In addition, we expect working capital to be a more significant use of cash, primarily due to the large syndication sales at Warners. All that aside, we still anticipate 2015 will be another healthy year for free cash flow generation and we expect to continue converting a very high percentage of our earning into free cash flow in the years to come.", "Looking at our balance sheet, we ended 2014 with $19.9 billion of net debt, up $1.6 billion compared to the end of 2013 that is primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders. As I mentioned at the start of my presentation, during 2014 we repurchased $5.5 billion in shares and, combined with our dividend, returned $6.6 billion in total to shareholders.", "During the year we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2 billion of long term debt at very favorable rates. On the M&A front we invested just under $1 billion in 2014. The majority of that was directed towards our financing arrangements with CME and our acquisition of Eyeworks' international television operations.", "Due to the programming, restructuring and severance charges in the second half of the year, our net leverage ratio was around three times at the end of 2014. However, explain those charges, our net leverage ratio would have been 2.7 times, slightly below our target level.", "One item to keep in mind in terms of our use of capital during the next few years will be the cash payments related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. The majority of these payments will be recognized in investing activities including a few hundred million dollars in 2015.", "On balance, I'm pleased with how we executed on our capital plan in 2014. And as we look ahead, neither our philosophy nor our processes around capital allocation have changed, so you can expect us to remain very disciplined and balanced in our approach to capital allocation.", "We remain committed to maintaining our solid investment grade credit ratings and are comfortable with our net leverage target of 2.75 times. We continue to believe that target provides us the flexibly to invest in our businesses, engage in strategic M&A and provide direct returns to shareholders, while at the same time optimizing our cost of capital and providing strong access to the capital markets in a variety of macroeconomic scenarios.", "With that, let's move on to the final slide which looks at our outlook for 2015. In 2015, we expect to deliver really attractive growth in adjusted operating income and another year of solid double-digit adjusted EPS growth and we expect that will be as a result of strong growth across all of our divisions.", "Before getting into the details, please note that my comments will be based on 2014 results, excluding the programming, restructuring and severance charges taken in the second half of the year. At Turner we will benefit from around $200 million in savings from the restructuring efforts and more modest programming expense growth as our NASCAR deal ended in 2014. Those factors should translate into healthy margin expansion.", "While we continue to see positive underlying trends internationally, the strong dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela will provide headwinds. Nonetheless, we anticipate a return to very healthy adjusted operating income growth which is evidence of our continued ability to manage our cost structure to drive attractive growth even in years with more modest top-line trends.", "At HBO we continue to see strong demand for our services globally and that should result in continued solid subscription revenue growth. And along with disciplined expense management, we anticipate that we will drive a significant acceleration in adjusted operating income growth in 2015. As we've previously discussed, we plan to launch an over-the-top service domestically this year and will provide more color on those plans as we get closer to launching.", "At Warner Bros., we anticipate revenue growth to be led by our TV syndication slate which includes 2 Broke Girls and Person of Interest. We also have a robust slate of video games anchored by key franchise releases, Batman: Arkham and Mortal Kombat, so we expect strong revenue growth combined with cost savings from the restructurings to translate into very attractive adjusted operating income growth and another record year at Warners.", "Looking across all three segments, we're set up for a very good year from an operating perspective and that is despite an expected drag on adjusted operating income of approximately $250 million to $300 million as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar and the exchange rate change in Venezuela. That impact will primarily show up at Turner and Warner Bros. and equates to approximately $0.20 to $0.25 at the adjusted EPS level which we have factored into our outlook.", "It is also worth noting that intercompany eliminations will be a material drag this year due to increased content sales from Warner Bros. to HBO and Turner including the syndication sale of 2 Broke Girls. In addition, we started to recognize 100% of CME's losses in our equity income in the fourth quarter as a result of our accumulated net losses exceeding the book value of our common stock investments. For context, in 2014 this change would have resulted in an additional $0.05 negative impact to adjusted EPS.", "In terms of cadence, we expect 2015 adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year given the timing of both syndication availabilities and this year's theatrical slate at Warner Bros. Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2015 which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70 or mid-teens growth, when excluding the second-half restructuring and programming charges and tax matters we noted earlier and that is despite the negative impact of foreign exchange that I just noted.", "At the same time, our continued investments in high-quality video content and our industry-leading brands will position us for accelerating revenue growth in 2016. So we continue to expect high-teens adjusted EPS growth on average through 2018 and remain on track to hit the financial targets we shared with you at our investor day in October.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Howard. Joe, can you open up the line for questions please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question here comes from Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Please go ahead, sir.", "Doug Mitchelson", "One for Howard or John, one for Jeff. There has been a lot of focus on affiliate revenue growth for Turner Networks. I was hoping first, that Howard or John, you would help us know whether Turner domestic affiliate revenue is on track towards your initial budgets for pricing and subscriber levels or if those budgets have been shifting around as you saw 4Q results. And are you able to be more specific regarding the year-over-year domestic drivers for 4Q, the Dish impact and subscriber changes versus core pricing?", "And for Jeff, you expressed a lot of confidence in achieving 2016 EPS guidance, but I think some investors are still uncertain with all the cross-currents right now for affiliate revenue. You've got Sling TV and cord cutting, cord shaving; the Dish outage in October. I'm just curious, how many of the top 10 renewals are left to be completed and what drives your confidence in hitting your 2016 and beyond affiliate revenue goals? Thanks very much.", "Jeff Bewkes", "It's Jeff, I'll start. Let me just begin by saying I am and we're all still confident in our '16 and '18 targets and let me go into some of the reasons and then John and Howard will pick up from there. We did see some sub declines last year in the basic cable universe and we have planned for modest declines to continue. And I think, as everyone knows, ad growth has been very muted, but we still see very strong consumer demand for multichannel TV and increasing viewing across all the platforms. And we think that TV and video remains the best platform for reaching a mass audience for advertisers.", "We also see that multichannel revenues are all still growing at a healthy clip, so we think there is pretty good opportunity for continued growth. We're working closely with all our distributors to improve the consumer value proposition, that means more and more vibrant VOD offerings from all the networks.", "It means providing stacking rights for original series; that would be another example where I think HBO has all its series up pretty much. Turner has all of its series up. And we think more SVOD -- more VOD and more and better user interfaces are going to make a difference in all of the retention, basically, of multichannel TV. We're also moving aggressively to provide advertisers with the analytics and targeting that they are coming to expect. And we think that as we do that more successfully we're going to take back share from digital competitors over time.", "Beyond the traditional ecosystem, we think there's a lot of opportunity for companies like ours that specialize in high-quality content, not just in the U.S. but also globally. But if you just go back to the United States, Sling TV is one example of increased value and opportunity from networks like ours. HBO over-the-top is another example.", "So on the whole, we think the value of that content and of our networks is growing and we think some of the changes that all of us are beginning to see in having more flexible consumer offerings are going to support the value of the best networks and the strongest brands. That\u2019s basically why we see ourselves on track for our targets in '16 and '18. And John and Howard, I think you have a few things to add.", "John Martin", "Just a few additional comments, with regard to the rhythm of our affiliate contracts, we've got seven of the Top 10 affiliates closed and we anticipate closure of remaining deals this year. As we reported in the past, everything is going exactly in accordance with plan. We're achieving the rate increases and the terms that we have been seeking. And this year in the multiyear overall cycle we fully anticipated and we have communicated before, that there will be somewhat of a moderation in subscriber revenue growth, but then it's going to pick back up beyond 2015.", "I think it's important though, when you look at the longer-term trends of multichannel in the U.S. to understand that the evidence that we see clearly indicates that the main reason why people are leaving the multichannel universe, let's call them cord cutters is because they either can't afford it or they don't think there's enough value in the offerings that are currently being provided to them by the MVPDs. We also believe that a portion of that community would like to sign back up for multichannel TV if the offerings were comprised of more affordable and greater flexibility.", "I think Sling, as Jeff said is a great example, but I think it's important to understand that it is the first example. A lot of the economy packs that the MVPDs are currently offering are based more on whether the contracts allow for them and they are based more on cost and they're offered as retention tools as opposed to proactive marketing opportunities. I think that is going to change over time.", "We've been saying for a long time that there's too many channels in existence today. The approach that Time Warner and Turner have taken over the years of investing heavily in a core group of channels we think is going to really pay handsome dividends in the future, as we have two of the top five, three of the top 10 networks and 85% of our affiliate fees are comprised in the Top 4 and we're pleased to be in the Sling initial offering.", "So we're quite optimistic about how things are going to continue to evolve over time and we're quite optimistic about the hand that we have in terms of the value of the networks.", "Howard Averill", "Doug, just a quick point in terms of the drivers in the fourth quarter, the biggest impact was the result of FX and that was followed by the impact of the Dish dispute and then finally, there was a smaller impact from subscriber declines that includes sub losses, the move to smaller bundles, a redefinition of bulk accounts. So it's a handful of smaller impacts that make up the sub declines.", "Operator", "Our next question here comes from Mr. John Janedis from Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.", "John Janedis ", "Maybe a slight follow-up, can you give us an update on the Dish negotiation? I guess with the launch of Sling including your networks is the read-through that you\u2019re confident that something gets done in the near-term? And is the issue more on pricing or rights? And then, Howard based on your response to Doug's question, is Dish one of those three that are still outstanding? Thanks.", "Jeff Bewkes", "I will start and then the chorus will go. We're having very good conversations and we have a good business going with Dish that is why we all came -- Charlie's management and ours to I think a happy agreement on the Sling product. And we feel very good about our overall business together, whether it is at Turner or HBO. Beyond that, I don't have more to add. John, do you have more?", "John Martin", "John, I was just going to point out that Dish is one of the deals that we have not completed at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. David Bank from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "David Bank", "So it looks like Kevin Riley now has basically his team in place and I think we could assume that the new content cycle has begun. So could you, I guess first articulate is there a different vision that that team has in terms of genre or programming? Is it basic continuation of sort of the BOOM! [ph] brand and the Turner Comedy brand?", "When do we expect to see the impact of Kevin's team and his process on ratings for the schedule and ultimately on advertising? Then also, how close is he working with Peter Roth for a holistic Turner Warner product, as well as Kevin, for broader monetization outside of the first window? If you could talk about the holistic approach Warners has to the Turner properties there for content creation and distribution.", "John Martin", "It's John, I will start. Look, Kevin is here. He has hit the ground running. He has brought great new perspective, a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm. He has officially been here for just over a month and he is already announced a new organization and a new structure and he is bringing in some fresh talent. And he is working terrifically with David Levy and together working towards the upfront on the existing development slate and working on sharpening the brand positioning reach of TNT and TBS as we move into the future.", "I want to just caution that we got to give Kevin some time, because he hasn't been here for very long, but I couldn't be more pleased with the talent and the direction that our big networks are going to be going in and we're starting to build off of an increasing position of success.", "As we said before, TNT we're going to look to go a little bit younger, more dual and sharpen the TBS brand promise. But if you think about in the fourth quarter we premiered The Librarians which is the highest premiere on all ad-supported basic cable. It beat out Last Ship which was number two. We had six of the top 15 original dramas, as Jeff said. And on the original program side on TBS, we've got six new shows, three returning and 2 Broke Girls coming on from Warners. So I would love for Kevin to give some perspective on how Kevin and the team are working with Warners.", "We're really excited about two big dramas coming out of Warners that are going to be moving on to TNT soon and just from my perspective at Turner, I think the relationship has never been better and Warners is our most important partner.", "Kevin Tsujihara", "Peter Roth and Kevin Riley have a long history together at both FX and Fox and they've really hit the ground running. They can talk in shorthand; they have a great relationship. As John said, we have two big dramas that we feel really good about and we have a number of other projects in the hopper and so we feel great about where we're at with Turner as well as HBO. I think things from a Warner Bros.' production perspective and getting access to our roster of talent and being able to work as we're currently with Turner and HBO is a huge opportunity.", "Richard Plepler", "It's Richard. I would just add that this is the first time in history that Warner Bros. and HBO are doing business together in television production. Huge success with Leftovers doing over 7 million viewers, in production on Westworld with Jonathan Nolan and tremendously talented cast and I think it just speaks to what we talked about on investor day which is working together across divisions to maximize our capacity.", "Operator", "Our next here comes from Ms. Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Alexia Quadrani", "I've a question on HBO. It's been several quarters now since you had the deal with Amazon which obviously has the obvious benefit of giving you the revenue stream that you've been able to reinvest in programming. But beyond that benefit I guess can you talk about how you think it has maybe changed audience habits and sense? Are you seeing more -- do you think it's driving consumers to HBO, traditional HBO in terms of getting them hooked on shows or attracted to that kind of programming?", "Richard Plepler", "Couple of things, first of all the performance on Prime and everything we have heard from our friends in Amazon has exceeded even their expectations in terms of usage and customer satisfaction. We said at the beginning that in addition to helping us monetize some of our library -- remember it's windowed at three years, we thought it was a wonderful opportunity to have some of the 70 million non-HBO homes have a chance to sample some of our best programming. We think that only has the catalytic effect of driving people back to the network.", "Listen, we had the biggest sub growth last year any time in 30 years and I think there is a lot of factors that contributed to that, but Amazon I think might have been one of them because people have an opportunity to see what they previously haven't seen. So it has been a tremendously positive relationship for us which we expect to continue.", "Alexia Quadrani", "And then just a quick thought, if I can, on your commentary earlier about Turner subs. I think you mentioned it was a small cause I guess of the weakness in the subs in the quarter. And you said you had mentioned that you are expecting further sort of modest declines in subs in 2015. I guess are you looking for that decline to accelerate or is it kind of the same sort of level?", "Howard Averill", "We're expecting to see the same sort of levels that we saw over the past year or so.", "Jeff Bewkes", "But if I could add, you may see, as time goes on, some important increases coming out of more, better targeted bundles, smaller bundles with powerful networks that are more intentional by the distributors rather than just retention save packages that they have now, where they are essentially using low-cost networks to do retentions. So we would not necessarily sign up to a long term decline on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Jessica Reif Cohen", "I have two questions; the first is a follow-up to Jeff's comments on the expanded -- on behavioral-based advertising. Could you just talk a little bit about how you will sell this? Is this addressable advertising? And can you do it on your own or do you need the industry to participate?", "John Martin", "Listen, we will be talking a lot more about this at the upfront, and we have released this in a press release some time ago that we've got an arrangement with a third party who is going to help us with our mix of programming, connecting with advertisers and providing us with certain behavioral targeting capabilities that we previously didn't have. And we really look forward to the upfront, because I think you are going to see a much more unified Turner and much more focus on targeting and delivering audiences to advertisers, not just key demos.", "Just to repeat what Jeff said, because I think this is really, really important, the holy-grail for us, as advertising-supported cable network companies is to sync together the targeting capabilities which is the big selling point of digital right now, link that together with the reach and the fantastic immersive environment of full-scale, long-form video.", "And so we think that -- and that's just going to continue. We're going to invest. We're going to build internal capabilities and we're going to use the best products on the market to continue to get better at delivering ROI to our marketers.", "Jessica Reif Cohen", "Okay. We could go on forever on that one, but then just to switch gears; on HBO I know you said multiple times on this call that you will have an OTT offer later in the year. Can you just give some color on pricing and positioning? How do you not cannibalize your existing subs? There is a huge universe that doesn't get right now, whether they are pay-TV subs or non-pay-TV subs. So can you just talk about how you are thinking about approaching it?", "Richard Plepler", "Jessica, it's Richard. Look, we're going to price it in a way that obviously maximizes the value on all platforms. Quite obviously, it is a premium product and it will be priced accordingly. But the other point I would make as we talk to our distributors is there is a real opportunity out there in the low-hanging fruit of the 10-or-so-million broadband only homes and we're very excited about working together with them to leverage that opportunity. Our meetings have gone very well in that regard and I think it's a tremendous advantage for them and us to use HBO to drive broadband and to drive some of the low packaging.", "Michael Kopelman", "Joe, I think we have time for one more question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question here comes from Rich Greenfield from BTIG. Please go ahead.", "Rich Greenfield", "Kind of a conceptual question, your Netflix has come out and said they are spending $3 billion to $4 billion on content and I think Jeff Bezos announced as part of Amazon earnings, that they are going to spend $1.3 billion on content. So we're clearly seeing that big tech companies are investing heavily in content. Time Warner made the decision to scale back its tech investment and outsource technology to Major League Baseball. I just wanted you to go through the puts and takes of outsourcing technology versus having your own internal tech stack. Particularly I think it sounds like you are going to use HBO as kind of the leading force to build a direct-to-consumer business for your other brands and just how that all evolves.", "Richard Plepler", "Rich, it's Richard, let me start. First of all, I would dissent slightly that we're pulling back from our investments. We're not -- we're continuing to invest in technology. MLB is an investment in technology. We just happen to think that working with a partner that already has a platform built makes the most sense and we're very comfortable, we're on track for our launch. I can't say more about the date other than that we have a date and we feel very comfortable with our schedule.", "The thing I would add about content is, look it's true that there is a plethora of competition out there. It's also true that more is not better, only better is better. And I like our hand a lot, as I've said to you before given the range of talent that comes to our door, I think on a forward [ph] first call basis. So as we've said, this isn't a zero-sum game, other people are going to do good work, but we're going to have a first look at most everything that we want to make an investment in in terms of content.", "Kevin Tsujihara", "And I would add, as Richard said earlier, when we can go to our talent base and be able to demonstrate through Leftovers and Westworld that we're taking the best projects and projects over to HBO, it helps us as well because they are going to get access to the best talent that we have on a daily basis.", "Jeff Bewkes", "Rich, it's Jeff. I can't resist adding, those were nice numbers you gave on some of our new brothers and sisters in the content business. But as we mentioned in our call, I don't of it me or Howard, we have been ramping up our content spending dramatically over the last five or six years and we're continuing to do that. We're spending $15 billion a year on production, marketing, etc. It's going up to $19 billion in the horizon that we've been giving plans for.", "So there is global support in terms of viewers and attachment to video content. These check changes, whether they are being provided as platforms by other companies or which part of it we decide to provide, are simply making the content more powerful and bringing in more viewers and giving us more ways to monetize.", "Rich Greenfield", "If I could just follow-up -- that's a great answer. I'm just curious, is there any way to think about total companywide spending on technology?", "Jeff Bewkes", "We don't have that number sitting right here because it's hard to do the borders on that. There is so much technology, Rich involved in our ongoing operations. Just take CNN with its tens of feeds all over the world, all digital. We've got HBO GO. I think it's artificial to take a border on certain broadband-delivered tech products and not consider the very adjacent and very intertwined technology that is required in digital transmission backhauls, all of our feeds across the planet. We have hundreds of them, so that's why we don't segregate.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Rich. Thanks, everybody for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we're always around. We appreciate your time. Have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President-Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's fourth quarter and full-year earnings conference call.", "This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and full-year, and the other providing our 2016 full-year business outlook. Before we begin there are two items I need to cover.", "First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on Management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.", "Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "I will now to the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks our divisional CEOs, John Marten, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?", "Jeff Bewkes", "Thanks Mike. Thanks, everyone, for listening in this morning. We had another strong year in 2015. Our revenues increased 3% to $28.1 billion, adjusted operating income grew 19% to $6.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% to $4.75 a share. That's our seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS and we've outpaced all of our peers over that time.", "We also returned close to $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends and our updated $5 billion share repurchase authorization and our 15% increase and the dividend underscore our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and continued direct returns to shareholders.", "It's the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's allowed us to provide superior long-term returns to shareholders.", "As we discussed with you last quarter, the shift to on-demand multiplatform consumption of video content is accelerating. Consumers increasingly have greater control over where, when and on what device they watch their favorite content and they're responding by spending more time and money watching video than ever. With more options available they're also demanding great content be accompanied by a great viewing experience.", "And while these shifts present challenges, they also create enormous opportunities. In this environment we're convinced that the strongest brands, biggest networks and the best content will take share. Our strategy was designed with these shifts in mind and we're more confident than ever that we are ideally positioned to benefit.", "For years we've been investing in the very best video content and using technology to enhance the value of our brands. With our revenue growth is set to accelerate this year, we will be investing more aggressively not only in content, but also in new capabilities in digital products to ensure our brands and content are available wherever and however consumers look for them. And that we can monetize them effectively when they do.", "At the same time we will continue to take our brands around the world and operate as efficiently as possible to help fund investments in future growth. Our structure supports this strategy.", "We've deliberately reshaped the company to focus on high-quality video businesses with global scale and are well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for the very best video content.", "The combined scale of our businesses is critical to our ability to take advantage of that growth and it's particularly important in distribution and programming, the core of what we do as a company.", "The benefits of our strategy and the advantages of our scale and structure were evident in our many successes in 2015. Let me share a few highlights starting at our networks which continued to lead the industry.", "Turner was the only programming group with three of the top 10 ad supported cable networks in prime time among adults 18 to 49. And TBS finished as the number one entertainment cable network in that demo for the third consecutive year.", "Our operating momentum was strongest at CNN and Cartoon Network. In 2015 CNN was the fastest-growing top 40 cable networks in the U.S. in its key demo and Cartoon network was the only top three kid\u2019s network to grow ratings.", "And then when it comes to premium content HBO remains peerless. Its 43 content Emmy awards not only led all networks for the 14 consecutive year, but was also the most Emmys received in a single year by any network in at least 25 years. That included 12 for Game of Thrones setting a record for any series in one year.", "We demonstrated the combined strength of our brands and the scale of our network in affiliate negotiations during 2015. Last spring for example Turner and HBO worked together to renew their agreements with Dish and later in the year, Turner completed a deal with one of its largest distributors and now has all of its top 10 affiliates on a new rate card that will drive accelerating revenue growth starting in 2016.", "While strengthening its place inside the multichannel ecosystem, Turner has been expanding its presence outside with two of our biggest digital properties CNN Digital and Bleacher Report growing revenue over 25% on a combined basis.", "CNN Digital remains the top position in news for multiplatform views and Bleacher Report again finished the year as the number two digital sports destination in the U.S.", "HBO also accelerated its efforts outside the ecosystem with the pioneering launch of HBO NOW last April. HBO NOW was a significant contributor to HBOs 2.7 million domestic subscriber additions last year, capping its best two-year period of subscriber additions in the past 30 years. Just as importantly, HBO continue to have positive momentum with its traditional distributors.", "Outside the U.S., HBO Latin America introduced a standalone OTT product in Columbia followed recently by Mexico, expanding the international reach of our streaming products.", "We also extended high return, low risk licensing agreements in Canada and certain European territories as we continue to execute the multi-model international distribution strategy that we think best monetizes our great content.", "At Warner Bros we had a record year in both revenue and profits driven by growth in its television business and a best ever year in video games. While our overall theatrical performance was not as strong as another years, we\u2019re really proud of our two Oscar-nominated films, Mad Max: Fury Road and Creed.", "In television we were the leading supplier to broadcast again and we had the top new broadcast show in Blindspot, the top reality program with The Voice, and the top comedy in The Big Bang Theory.", "And Warner Bros ended the year as a top three video game publisher in the U.S. and Europe on the strength of Mortal Kombat X, Batman Arkham Knight, and the successful introduction of a new franchise in Lego Dimensions.", "Warner has also continued to build its international business to tap into the significant growth opportunity we see in China specifically. Last year Warner entered into an exciting new venture to produce local language films.", "Our confidence in the China opportunities that we enforce by the success of Hollywood VIP, an SVOD partnership between Warner' and Tencent, Holiday VIP added more than $5 million new subscribers in 2015 helped by its exclusive access to Warner Bros Movies and HBO's original program.", "So 2015 was another very successful year on multiple fronts and thanks for the investments we've been making we're poised for an even better year in 2016 as we roll out richer, more engaging content line ups across the company and accelerate the pace of investment and innovation.", "At HBO that includes increasing the hours of original programming by 50% globally. We'll have an unmatched line-up of returning shows including Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, John Oliver, Ballers and VEEP as well as some of our oldest new programming in years including Vinyl from Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger which will debut this Sunday, Westworld from JJ Abrams and produced by Warners, and Divorce with Sarah Jessica Parker.", "We also have an ambitious roster of new programming geared to the NOW audience, including shows from Jon Stuart, Bill Simmons, Sesame Street and a Daily Vice Newscast.", "As we introduce all this new content and further expand distribution, we\u2019re going to step up our marketing reach beyond that. We think the combination of an even stronger original programming line-up and best selection of hit Hollywood movies and ever improving digital products will drive continued subscriber growth both at HBO NOW and with our traditional distributors.", "As we renegotiate some of our more important affiliate agreements over the next couple of years, we expect to better monetize those subscribers and accelerate subscription revenue growth at HBO.", "We\u2019ll continue to expand HBO streaming products internationally as well. We anticipate significantly expanding our OTT footprint in Latin America and recently we announced plans to launch a standalone streaming product in Spain later this year.", "We\u2019re equally excited about everything to Turner has in store for 2016. It\u2019s going to historic year for Turner Sports, which will broadcast the NCAA Men\u2019s Basketball Finals for the first time and we\u2019re rolling out Turner's new E-Sports league in partnership with WME/IMG.", "And as we head into the home stretch of delivering 2016 presidential election race, CNN will continue to be the place to find authoritative political coverage and analysis.", "In Kids, Cartoon will look to build on its momentum from last year and we\u2019re excited about Boomerang's content refresh and global expansion which is the centerpiece of the Kids partnership between Warner and Turner.", "This year we\u2019ll also start the brand refreshes of TBS and TNT. TBS recently kicked off it's near line-up with launches of Angie Tribeca and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. We're already changing perceptions of what to expect from the network and there is a lot more to come.", "TNT will start its own refresh later this year with projects such as Animal Kingdom from producer John Wells and Warner Bros. Good Behavior and The Alienist joining its existing line up of leading original, while it will take some time to fully refresh their line ups, we\u2019re already seeing evidence of a bolt new voice from both networks.", "These changes at TBS and TNT are just the latest steps in a multiyear transformation at Turner. Over the last several years, we put in place new management teams at Cartoon Networks, CNN, truTV and Turner's international portfolio and the results give us a lot of confidence in our ability to further strengthen TBS and TNT in the years ahead.", "In 2015, CNN and Cartoon significantly outpaced their peers and one year after it\u2019s rebrand truTV's ratings in its key demos returned to growth in the fourth quarter and excluding the impact of FX, Tuners internationals networks have grown profits over 60% since 2013.", "2016 is also set to be blockbuster year at Warner Bros. We\u2019re expecting another record performance this time led by our theatrical business. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice arrives in theatres on March 25 and its one of the most anticipated films of this or any year. More than just to class between the two iconic super hero\u2019s it will mark the beginning of a multiyear slate of franchise films at Warner\u2019s.", "DC will be a significant part of that slate including Suicide Squad this August and Wonder Woman and the First Justice League movie in 2017. Cartoon Network is also launching a new justice league TV show which will join Teen Titans Go, another DC-based program from Warner Bros and the number one show on Cartoon Network.", "That underscores both DCs success in television. It has eight shows on air this season and the deepening integration between Warner\u2019s and Turners Kids business.", "The strength of our theatrical slide extends far beyond the DC titles. We're just as excited about fantastic pieces and where to find them. The magical return to JK Rowling's world of Harry Potter set for release this November and we\u2019re already looking forward for the return of our Lego franchise in 2017 with and Lego Batman and Ninjago.", "As those title migrate into premium and broadcast windows we'll also benefit from them on HBO and Turner's network.", "While it's too early in the development season, we're very confident about the prospects of Warner Bros TV and the upcoming TV season. We're expanding and diversifying our slate of programming working to expand our leadership position in broadcast to basic cable, premium cable and OTT services.", "That includes some of HBO's and Turner's biggest new shows that I noted before as well as original broadening for SVOD services like 11/22/63 for Hulu and Fuller House for Netflix.", "Putting all of this together, I hope you can appreciate why we expect 2016 to be a standout year for Time Warner. We expect the investments we've made in recent years to drive and acceleration in revenue growth.", "Along with continued cost discipline that will allow us to invest aggressively in the business while delivering very attractive financial results. All that's reflected in the outlook we released this month.", "We're just as confident about our long-term prospects. As I noted earlier, the shift to on-demand consumption is accelerating and we're stepping up our pace of innovation investment to match it.", "Because of our industry-leading brands and scale, we're in a great position to take advantage of the many opportunities these shifts are creating and we have clear momentum across the company, so we fully expect to continue delivering industry leading financial results and shareholder returns in many years to come.", "Thanks for listening in. I'll turn it over to How.", "Howard Averill", "Thanks Jeff and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.", "As you'll recall, 2014's results were affected by significant restructuring and severance charges across the company and programming charges at Turner. Given the nature and size of these items my comments today related to expenses, margins and adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter and full year will exclude these charges from all periods.", "Starting with consolidated results, for the year revenues grew 3% or 7% excluding a drag of almost 400 basis points from FX. Adjusted operating income increased 6% or a very healthy 13% absent or more than 700 basis points currency headwind and that came despite a decline in the fourth quarter primarily due to the timing of programming expenses at Turner, programming charges at HBO and difficult comparisons at Warner.", "As a result of the restructuring actions we took and ongoing efficiency measures, we limited total expense growth to 2% and increased margins close to a 100 basis points. When we took those actions, we set a goal of $500 million in cost savings.", "We recognized the majority of those savings this year and expected to catch our initial target in 2016. Those savings helped find nearly $12 billion in content investments across the company. So we were able to drive margin expansion while still investing aggressively in the business.", "Moving down the income statement, adjusted EPS of $4.75 exceeded our outlook for the year and when excluding an FX drag of $0.50, adjusted EPS growth was a very strong 27%.", "In addition to our strong operating performance, we also benefited from our share repurchase program. In 2015, we repurchased $3.6 billion of our share. So combined with $1.2 billion in dividend we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders during the year. So we had another really good year in 2015.", "That was the result of the same combination of top tier operating performance, relentless focus on efficiency, growth investments and disciplined capital allocation that has allowed us to provide our shareholders with long-term returns well above our peer group average and that's the combination we will continue to strive for in 2016 when we anticipate another year of attractive growth.", "That's reflected in our 2016 outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40 achieving current rates including approximately $0.15 year-over-year headwind from FX. Since that additional FX headwind, our outlook would imply mid to high teens growth in adjusted EPS. I'll provide additional context during our outlook as we go through the presentation.", "Now turning to the segment highlights. I'll start at Turner where we grew adjusted operating income double digits in 2015 even in the face of significant FX headwinds and while we continue to invest in the transformation Jeff discussed.", "Advertising revenues increased 2% for the year and 5% in the quarter that was ahead of our expectations for the quarter due to the strong domestic ad market and improved ratings trends.", "Domestic advertising grew high single digits in the quarter. That was boosted by particularly strong results in news and kids record ratings for MLP Playoff games and comparison for last year's dispute with Dish and the airing of three additional major league baseball playoff games.", "International advertising grew low double digits in the quarter excluding an over 18 percentage point drag from FX and the benefit from the consolidation of our sports network in Brazil.", "Looking ahead to the first quarter we're seeing a continuation of the recent positive trends. So we expect total advertising revenue to be up in the mid-single digits despite continued FX headwinds and with the scatter pricing pacing up double digits versus the upfront, historically low cancellation levels and great momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to our very strong upfront this year.", "Moving on, subscription revenues were up 1% for the year, but looking through the impact of foreign currency would have increased 5%. In the fourth quarter domestic subscription revenues grew in the mid-single digits, which included a benefit of from the top against the dispute with Dish last year and absent a greater than 20 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue grew in the low single digits. A slowdown internationally was due in part to the timing of revenues related to a contract renewal.", "Looking to 2016 we now achieved the rate increases we were targeting with all of our top 10 domestic distributors. So we continue to expect domestic subscription revenue growth to accelerate into the low teens starting in the first quarter.", "We also anticipate attractive local currency growth at our international networks. So our current rates FX headwinds will prevent a return to reported growth until the later parts of the year.", "Adjusted operating income was up 11% for the year. As we anticipated, that included a fourth quarter decline due to 13% programming cost growth, which was mainly a result of higher MLB expenses and the timing of original programming.", "For the year, total expenses declined 3% and margins expanded over 300 basis points to the highest level in Turner's history. That was due to continue tight cost control and the benefits of the restructuring we undertook in 2014.", "Putting that all together, Turner delivered very strong growth in adjusted operating income while making progress on the multi-year transformation of our core networks. We took share in both news and kids and started the hard work of rebranding our entertainment network. And with the investments we made across the business we laid the groundwork for continued attractive growth in the years to come.", "Turning now to HBO where we had another year of strong subscriber growth, while continuing to make the investments necessary to go after the significant global opportunity we see for the business.", "Subscription revenues were up 3% for the quarter and 4% for the year. Both periods included about 100 basis point headwind from the combination of foreign exchange and the transfer of HBO's basic cable service in India to Turner.", "Domestic subscription revenue increased in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and the year. We continue to see very strong growth in our subscriber base, but subscriber mix remained a constraint on revenue growth.", "At the same time, we're pleased with the early progress we're making with HBO NOW who's contribution to subscription revenue increased sequentially throughout the year.", "As we move into 2016, we expect the revenue contributions from HBO NOW to increase further as we rollout new programming and expand distribution allowing us to invest even more aggressively in marketing the product and later in the year, we expect to begin renewing some of our affiliate deal, which should result in improved monetization of our subscriber base.", "Moving to content and other revenue, which grew 20% in the quarter and 6% for the year, that's mainly due to higher international licensing revenues and is indicative of a strong demand we're seeing globally for HBO's premium content.", "Across the HBO's international networks including unconsolidated JVs, revenues increased high single digits for the quarter and year when excluding the impact of FX and transfer of the basic service in India and subscriber growth remained strong especially in Latin America and Europe.", "Adjusted operating income was down 3% in the quarter but up 1% for the year. The decline in the fourth quarter was mainly due to higher programming expenses, which increased 11%.", "That growth included programming charges primarily related to series and development that HBO decided not to move forward with. Looking through those charges programming cost would have grown 1% in the quarter.", "For the full year, total expenses increases 5% reflecting investments in technology and marketing related to the launch of HBO NOW as well higher programming cost.", "So 2015 was another successful year for HBO as we maintained the subscriber momentum we had for the past few years and with another year of profit growth and continue to execute our key strategic initiatives including the launch of standalone streaming products in the U.S. and Latin America.", "And given the strength of both the global demand for our product and our programming slate, we remain very confident in HBO's ability to accelerate its growth over the next several years.", "Moving on to Warner Bros, despite a dip in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with record revenues and profits lead by our TV and games businesses. We achieved that even with a material drag from FX.", "On the TV side, revenues increased modestly in the quarter due largely to international growth and for the year, TV revenue grew double-digits that was primarily due to significant growth in licensing revenue including the domestic licensing of 2 Broke Girls, Big Bang Theory, Person of Interest, Seinfeld and Friends.", "We also continue to see increasing demand and strong pricing around the globe for Warner's hit content. So we remain encouraged by the strong secular trends in the TV business.", "Turning to video games, we have difficult comparisons in the quarter against Lego Batman 3 and Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor. Even so, we posted record video games revenue up close to $1.5 billion for the year and with the great IP and strong franchisee at Warner's we're confident we can continue to grow our games business over time.", "We actually knew 2015 would be a challenging year given the lack of any core franchisee releases and the comparison against the end of the Hobbit trilogy, as well as the releases of the Lego movie and Godzilla. So as expected revenues declined for both the quarter and the year.", "Looking ahead, 2016 will mark the beginning of an ambitious slate of franchisee movies including at least 17 releases from our DC, Lego and World of Harry Potter franchises through 2020. So we feel great about the outlook for our theatrical business in 2016 and beyond.", "Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenue declined 10% for the year due to continued weakness and physical sale in particular catalog releases and lower carry-over revenue.", "However, digital trends remain healthy with the FT growing in the high teens for Warner's. On the expense side and in line with the enterprise wide focus on cost efficiency, Warner's reduced SG&A by 2% for the year and that included significant savings from the 2014 restructuring actions.", "So on the whole Warner's had a terrific year and with a moment at our TV and games businesses and ambitious franchisee film slate for the next several years we're in great position to drive attractive growth at Warner's for the foreseeable future.", "Turning to the next slide, we generated very healthy free cash of $3.6 billion in 2015 converting over 90% of our earnings into cash. The year-over-year increase was due to the growth in adjusted operating income and lower cash taxes and not despite the increase in working capital as a result of increased content investments across our division and severance payments related to the restructuring initiatives in 2014.", "Our cash taxes declined primarily due to the timing of tax legislation and related payments. Looking to 2016 we expect another year of solid growth and free cash flow driven by strong profit growth and continued high conversion.", "Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended 2015 with $21.6 billion of net debt up $1.8 billion from the end of 2014. That's primarily a result of our continued commitment to direct returns to shareholders.", "During 2015 we repurchased $3.6 billion in shares and combined with our dividend return $4.8 billion to shareholders. And as Jeff noted earlier the Board authorized a 15% increase in our dividend and up to $5 billion in share repurchases, reinforcing our commitment to provide direct returns to shareholders.", "During the year we took advantage of favorable marketing conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $2.8 billion of long term debt including our first euro denominated debt offering. We also extended the maturity of our revolving bank credit facilities through the end of 2020.", "Meanwhile we retired $2 billion of debt in the year as a result of a maturity and a tender offer and redemption of higher price debt and on the investments front, we spent close to $700 million about half of which is related to our real estate project at Hudson Yards. We expect to invest a similar amount in that project in 2016.", "We ended the year with a net leverage ratio of approximately 2.85 times just about our target level. Looking forward we plan to return to our target leverage ratio of 2.75 times over the next few quarters and we don\u2019t anticipate a change in either that target level or our capital allocation\u2019s velocity which will remain focused on investment back into our businesses, coupled with M&A and consistent direct returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "With that let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. 2016 marks the start of what we anticipate will be a strong content cycle across the company and that should translate into an acceleration in revenue and adjusted operating income growth and another year of strong growth in adjusted EPS.", "At Turner we expect another strong year as we take advantage of faster revenue growth and continued cost efficiencies to increase investment for the future.", "As I mentioned earlier, subscription revenue growth should accelerate meaningfully and advertising revenue should benefit from a strong ad market, continued momentum at CNN, including from its election coverage, and entering the NCAA championship game for the first time.", "And at the same time, we are planning for higher programming and marketing expenses tied primarily to the NCAA championship game and the start of our new NBA deal in 4Q as well as election coverage at CNN and investments in originals related to the brand repositioning at both TBS and TNT. We remain focused on continuing to efficiently manage overhead expenses to help fund these initiatives.", "At HBO we also expect faster growth in subscription revenue in 2016 driven by continued subscriber gains including from HBO NOW and improved monetization of our subscriber base. Over the next couple of years we would expect that to take HBO subscription revenue growth into the high-single-digits.", "That will be balanced against investments associated with HBO's slate of new originals as well as the new programming targeted for digital platforms. We will also continue to invest in marketing and technology to drive growth on HBO's digital platform.", "At Warner Bros. we will kick off our slate of franchise films with the release of Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and the first of Jo Rowling's Fantastic Beasts films and while we are facing challenging comparisons in TV licensing and video games, we expect both businesses to continue to deliver healthy results.", "In addition, we remain focused on driving margin expansion through efficiency measures and the transition to digital. So all in all we expect very strong growth and another record year at Warner.", "So looking across all three segments we are set up for a very good year from an operating perspective. That is despite an estimated year-over-year FX drag of approximately $125 million on adjusted operating income and approximately $0.15 on adjusted EPS, which we have factored into our outlook.", "And if we look back relative to the expectations we shared with you at our Investor Day, the FX drag on adjusted EPS in 2016 is in the range of $0.55 to $0.60. Absent that we would be on track for the close $6 in adjusted EPS we shared with you then.", "In terms of the cadence of the year, we expect our earnings to be weighted toward the back half as a result of the timing of both our film slate and marketing investments at HBO and Turner.", "Putting all that together, we expect another very good year in 2016, which is reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40. And that incorporates continued investments in high quality video content and new business models and capabilities that should position the Company to continue to drive very attractive growth for the next several years and beyond.", "With that I will turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Howard. Mike, can we please open up the line for Q&A?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Hi. Thank you. There seems to be a lot of opportunity ahead with HBO, traditional domestic opportunity, HBO NOW and international. I guess can you provide us some color of where you think the most upside is, specifically any upcoming milestones that come to you from the outside, for signs of traction?", "I know you mentioned some renewals later this year, I guess any color on when and what to expect there and any more color you can give us on HBO NOW subscribers.", "Jeff Bewkes", "Hey, thanks, Alexia. This is Jeff, I'm going to turn it to Richard.", "Richard Plepler", "Alexia, thank you. Look, we had a terrific year in sub growth, 2.7 million additional subs. Quite obviously our mission and our opportunity is now, as we have said, to go capture the revenue that reflects that sub growth toward the end of this year and into next year and we are going to do that.", "HBO NOW, where we are just getting started, I think we have made a lot of progress. We are not yet out on two major platforms, PlayStation and Xbox, which, for example, on HBO GO account for over 20% of viewing.", "And we've not yet put out the content like Jon Stewart, Bill Simmons, VICE daily news show that we think is particularly suited for those platforms. And that of course will catalyze a great deal of marketing, digitally and otherwise, which we think will drive subscriptions.", "So, we are very excited about where we are. I think it is important to punctuate that of the 2.7 million, those are full paying subscribers. Our job now is to go -- as the deal renewal cycles open up at the end of this year and into the next 18 months, to go capture that revenue and we intend to do that.", "Jeff Bewkes", "Richard, why don't you add a little about international HBO?", "Richard Plepler", "Sure. Well look, we have three basic tenants of course of profit around the world, one is our networks business in 60 countries, and of course licensing into over 150 countries. And it is not, as we've said to you before, a one-size-fits-all strategy. We look at this market by market where we think we can make the most money and we follow the money.", "We just added an OTT service in Spain, doing the cost benefit and decided that that is where the best long-term growth opportunity was for us. We extended a licensing deal in Canada with Bell Canada and Bell Media because that's where we thought the best long-term growth opportunity was.", "So we take this market by market, we have a lot of flexibility and the reason I think that we're uniquely suited to exploit these opportunities is because we own our own content and that gives us an enormous amount of flexibility however we choose to pivot around the world.", "Howard Averill", "Hey, Alexia, this is Howard. Just to clarify one thing. The 2.7 million subs, they are paying consumers, we're just not seeing the benefit, as Richard pointed out. That we need to go and we need to work with our distributors to renegotiate as we go forward so that we capture some of that upside as we move forward.", "Alexia Quadrani", "And then would you see some of that I assume when you do some of the renewals that you pointed to toward the end of this year as well?", "Richard Plepler", "Precisely right.", "Howard Averill", "Yes, that starts this year and it goes over the next 18 months or so.", "Jeff Bewkes", "Look I can't resist -- this is Jeff. I can't resist adding, this is exactly what we've been telling you and it is on track because, remember what we are all focused on here, particularly at HBO, is that we want to show the value and demonstrate consumer penetration, these are paying subs, the value of the service.", "We intended to do that before then aligning the affiliate renewals to capture the money and this is something we do in partnership and in order to incentivize our distributors. And we are pushing HBO out both in traditional distribution and on the NOW platform to cover either of the 70 million basics that don't have pay TV or to go after the 12 million or 13 million broadband only's, again just in the U.S.", "But if you look at it across all of those platforms, it's basically quite an advantageous position that HBO is now in to accelerate the revenues, not just in '16, but in '17, '18 and beyond.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Thank you very much.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Alexia. Mike, can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "The next question is from John Janedis from Jefferies.", "John Janedis", "Hi. Thank you. Just wanted to start maybe with a couple of housekeeping questions. First, can you clarify the programming charges during the quarter by segment? And do you foresee more in the near-term? And then secondly, for the '16 guidance, how much of its driven by the tax rate and do you expect to buy back a similar amount of stock this year?", "Howard Averill", "Hey, John, this is Howard. So in terms of program impairments, at Turner we had about $130 million in the fourth quarter and that was tied to the TBS and TNT transition which has now started at TBS and we have rolled out some new shows and we are pretty pleased so far with where that is going.", "There is another $50 million or so of charges at HBO and that was tied to some series that we decided not to move forward with which happens occasionally. So in the quarter it was about $180 million of charges.", "As far as the taxes and the buyback, I would say the tax rate in '16 will actually go up versus '15. That's in part because we saw some fourth quarter benefits that lowered the rate overall for '15. So I think if you look forward you should see a tax rate that might be up a couple hundred basis points, more in line with what we had in the first three quarters of 2015.", "In terms of buybacks, as always that's going to depend on what our free cash flow generation is and what other alternative uses of capital are. But given that we ended the year at about 2.85 times, which was above our target leverage of 2.75 times, I would expect that the buyback would come down a bit versus 2015 levels.", "John Janedis", "Thanks, Howard. And maybe, Jeff, separately. You talked a bit now about potentially retaining rights longer or delaying SVOD sales. Can you give us updated views? And is there any anecdotal evidence that there would be an impact on ratings given how millennials consume content?", "Do others need to follow to strengthen the industry broadly and if there is anything to share in the context of partnering in Hulu that would be helpful, thanks.", "Jeff Bewkes", "That's a lot of questions. Let's start with what you were talking about in terms of either syndication sales, windows, etc. We are not ideological about syndication windows, that depends on evolution and a lot of factors.", "But I think the overriding point everybody ought to focus on is that it is becoming crystal clear that consumers want the ability to watch their favorite show, their favorite network on demand across whatever platform they are watching, whatever window it is, whether it's a new show, current season, whether it is one- or two-year-old show they want to see it on demand.", "We want to make sure our networks have the flexibility to meet that consumer demand. Now if you look at HBO, a perfect example. HBO has for many years provided on demand access to almost all the content, multiple seasons that it has ever produced. Some of the new entrants in the business that have VOD as a primary feature have also put multiple seasons on.", "The Turner networks are committed to delivering more programming on demand across their distribution channels, that is whether you get it in a new bundle over the top, whether you get it through a traditional distributor. And Warner's already sells broad suites of rights when partners are interested in them. And of course Warner sells to every kind of network, broadcast, premium, cable, over the top subscription VOD services.", "So the overriding development, which is a good development, is that consumers want VOD on whatever show or window they are watching and we are basically moving to satisfy consumer demand.", "Now your second question, which is what has to happen, not just in our company, and I think we have been pretty clear about what we said, is that distributors need to be able to offer more on-demand functionality.", "We see them moving quite rapidly now to do that. You can look at interfaces and on-demand offerings at Comcast. You can see new bundles and moves at Verizon or Sling and I think Sony has a new product.", "I think you are going to see ever increasing innovation across the distribution platforms over the top and in traditional distribution package offerings. So this consumer demand is going to be satisfied and it is basically going to be good for any brand, any network or any show that has strong consumer residence.", "And that is why we think that it's very good for our very concentrated suite of networks at Turner and HBO and we think it's very good for the world's leading producer of TV shows and films, which is Warner Bros. He had one more question, what was it?", "Howard Averill", "Well I just want to go back to it. I want to just do some housekeeping on your housekeeping question which you talked about are there future plans for charges. There is not any plans for any material charges going forward.", "Jeff Bewkes", "I think you asked a question about Hulu.", "John Janedis", "Correct.", "Jeff Bewkes", "Yes. Well, as you know, we're not going to comment on someone else's asset or any press speculation. But so putting aside who -- we're actively pursuing opportunities outside the ecosystem. You have heard it at Turner, at HBO, at Warner's.", "It is part of our efforts to meet the consumer demand who are looking for more video and more VOD, whether it is HBO NOW, whether it is our Turner networks and all the new over-the-top bundles, whether it is both Turner HBO product or Warner product in overseas markets, basically that is what you are seeing. We think it is a good thing that we have these new entrants offering more on-demand.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, John. Mike, can we have our next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thank you. I have one for Richard and one for John. Richard, now you are into the first year of life at HBO NOW. I wonder what has surprised you in terms of the roll out. And how have you adjusted your strategies based on that learning?", "And then for John, there's been increasing focus by us on minimum carriage agreements between networks and distributors. So if you could talk a bit about how close Turner is to your floors on those minimums and whether or not you have to adjust down any of your minimums in exchange for the better pricing that you received?", "Richard Plepler", "Michael, thank you, it is Richard. Look, we are learning all the time. We are at this eight months, we are at about 800,000 paying subscribers. We see an enormous amount of opportunity ahead.", "As I said to Alexia, we are excited about getting on additional platforms. We're excited about bringing new content to the product which we think is going to draw people in on a daily basis, things like Stewart and VICE News and Simmons and we're going to begin to market more aggressively.", "But again, I don't want to bury the lead. HBO NOW is an additive part of our growth strategy. And what we have seen in the ecosystem where we see the vast amount of growth is that we have huge opportunities there as well. So we are going to work on a multifaceted way to expand our sub base and to expand our sub revenue as I discussed earlier.", "John Martin", "Hi, Michael, it's John. So with respect to your carriage agreement question, for a long time now Turner has paid a lot of attention to it distribution commitments. And I'm not going to speak specifically about any one of our distributors, but we do have protections in all of our agreements and we feel really confident from a contractual standpoint that we will be highly penetrated and remain highly penetrated.", "I think more importantly over time what's going to determine the distribution strength is going to be the strength of your brands. And we have now -- and this has been a long time coming for Turner and Time Warner, we've just now completed a distribution rate renewal cycle that we started planning for four years ago and beginning in the first quarter of 2016 we're going to see meaningful acceleration in our domestic subscription revenues.", "And we feel great about that, we think it is a tremendous validation of the brands that we have. And I feel very confident that our brands are going to be carried in all and any major programming packages going forward. So we haven't made -- and specifically to your question have we made adjustments down on penetration, the answer is no.", "Michael Nathanson", "Okay. Thanks John,", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Michael. Mike, can we have our next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.", "Ben Swinburne", "Thank you. Good morning. A couple. Howard, I don't know if you would be willing to help us with working capital and cash taxes for '16. And then, John, just picking up on the Turner outlook, as I am sure you are well aware, there is a big focus on domestic affiliate revenue growth across the space.", "Now that you have got all of your deals done can you help us with '17 and '18? I think you had guided to low teens again in 2017. But given what you are seeing in subs and sub trends and your deals that are now done, you probably have pretty good visibility so any comfort there you could give us would be really helpful.", "And then if I can sneak one more in on HBO. Richard, have you thought about -- I am sure you have thought about it, but are you -- are there any restrictions to changing the price point on HBO NOW? Just wondering if you have considered lowering the price of the over the over-the-top product in the U.S. given where the sort of other over-the-top services are priced? Thanks.", "John Martin", "Do you want me to start? Hey, Ben, it is John. I will start on the carriage agreements and visibility. Look, I think this is one of the great benefits of being in this business and having the great partnerships that we have with our affiliates is that we have multiple year deals with great visibility on how that is going to translate into revenue.", "And so, as I said, we still continue to expect, and we have been predicting this now for a long time, that our subscription revenues are going to accelerate into the low teens in 2016.", "I think in 2017 I would expect the growth rate to be in a similar level. We feel really terrific about and confident about our ability to achieve those levels. We have done everything we said we were setting out to do on our rate renewal cycle and we feel great about that.", "Ben Swinburne", "Thank you.", "Richard Plepler", "Yes, Ben, you wanted to know about price. Look, we don't have any plans to change the price point at this point. We have a lot of flexibility. But what we are seeing is an enormous amount of growth in the ecosystem. So, listen, we think that our premium price right now makes sense. And we will assess that as we go forward, but right now we have to plans to change it.", "Howard Averill", "Back to free cash flow, Ben. So as I mentioned, in 2015 we converted at over 90% of our earnings to cash flow. We see strong conversion going forward, nothing really unusual from a working capital standpoint.", "I would say with respect to cash taxes, we did see some benefit this year from some legislation. We're going to see continued benefit in '16, but I would expect it might tick up a bit from a cash tax standpoint in 2016.", "Ben Swinburne", "Thank you all.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Ben. Operator, Mike, can we have the next question please?", "Operator", "And your next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura Securities.", "Anthony DiClemente", "Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Kevin and one for John. Kevin, of course big film year for Warner's. I wonder if you can also touch on the TV licensing comparisons that Howard mentioned, the large syndication sales that you guys had in 2015 in the prepared remarks.", "And given those compares on content licensing, I wonder if you could help us with the swing factors around the growth trajectory for Warners in 2016. So can video games and film kind of more than offset the tough TV licensing comps this year?", "And then for John, Howard said just back to restructuring, I know Howard just said that you have no plans for further restructurings as of now, but I was just wondering at Turner what gives you the confidence and do you think the businesses are right sized at this point given the cable TV environment.", "Do you have any further cost-cutting for the non-programming expenses planned and just walk us through how you evaluate that on an ongoing basis. Thank you.", "Kevin Tsujihara", "Anthony, it's Kevin. As Howard mentioned, we do face a very difficult comp from a TV licensing perspective. We don't have -- we had 2 Broke Girls, Person of Interest, Friends and Seinfeld and the second cycle of Big Bang Theory. We don't have similar type product going down the pipeline in 2016.", "But I will say that one of the things that we do have we have Monk coming up. And the lumpiness of television licensing has decreased as you have seen more of the SVOD revenue.", "Shows like Blindspot, Supergirl, Lucifer and Legends of Tomorrow, which are big first-year shows this year, won't have the same type of one-time kind of lumpiness as you look at how we are recognizing revenue and how we are selling these shows going forward.", "'16 and beyond, '16 and '17 are big film years, it's what we talked to you about in October. Feel really good about kind of setting up a film franchise with Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts look great. And so yes, I do believe that film and games will more than offset the difficult comp in TV and we will have strong growth in 2016.", "Anthony DiClemente", "Thanks, Kevin.", "John Martin", "Hay, Anthony, its John. So let's start with where we are at right now, yes we've taken some pretty material restructuring recharges over the last couple of years. As you heard Howard say, no plans on the programming side. Look, I would say -- to take additional restructurings that is.", "Look, with regard to expenses overall on an adjusted basis, Turner finished 2015 with the highest margins we have had in its history. And I think our margins are now at or near the top of for the industry is and having said that, we are going to remain incredibly disciplined across the entire Company as it relates to expenses and pay very close attention to how and where we are spending our money.", "And we are going to be doing that at the same time that we are going to be investing to improve capabilities and build new businesses. So, I feel terrific about the efficiency of the operations of the Company right now.", "I still believe longer term that our programming costs will grow in the high-single-digit range which is what we have been saying now for a long time and our non-programming costs should grow much, much more slowly than that.", "Howard Averill", "I just wanted to follow on and just point out -- John's discussion of the efficiency at Turner that is a philosophy across the entire company. It is something that we continue to be focused on as we move forward.", "Anthony DiClemente", "Okay, thanks.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks, Anthony. Mike, next question please.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Richard Greenfield with Deutsche Bank.", "Brandon Ross", "Ross from BTIG in for Rich. Two questions, one for Jeff and one for Richard. First for Jeff, one of your peers, Facebook, grew mobile ad revenue by $2 billion year over year in Q4 alone, largely on the back of video advertising.", "As consumer engagement shifts to mobile away from TV what is your strategy for competing specifically in mobile? Do you need to start new businesses, make acquisitions, or combine with another entity?", "Jeff Bewkes", "Brandon is this Jeff. Good question. We're focused on that opportunity. And let's break it into a couple of pieces. One is availability and that is we are committed to making our content available across all platforms including mobile. That is why we went out years ago and put the TBE contracts in place for VOD to all of our affiliates. That is why HBO announced On Demand more than a decade ago and now they have NOW.", "And so what we have been doing, if you go beyond those two pretty obvious examples, is we've been building more digital businesses that go straight to mobile.", "So let's look at them. There is CNN, which is the leader in mobile news and you are seeing very strong growth in CNN in all digital platforms but certainly in mobile and domestically and internationally, by the way.", "You have the launch of Great Big Story, that is already with 170 million video views in just the first few months. Bleacher Report -- the number two online sports destination in the country has a very strong mobile presence given the nature of that programming, particularly with its team stream app.", "Super Deluxe, which is a new launch at Turner of a digital studio that makes short form video that is very weighted to mobile, is yet another one. So if you take all of those together, that could -- probably should add some -- John, add the cartoons.", "John Martin", "Yes, just to amplify what Jeff said, the other category where we have a very strong competitive position and we are really focused on growing the business is in kids. We re-launched the mobile app for Cartoon Network in the summer and within two months I think our traffic doubled.", "And so, there is going to be consistent innovation as we are going to continue to make our products better and better and better. And I think the monetization of our traffic on all of these platforms is going to begin to improve.", "Jeff Bewkes", "And then let's go back to HBO. You were asking mostly from the position -- from the point of view of ad revenue. HBO doesn't do that. But we have a lot of sub revenue there that is tied to mobile as well.", "So new content like John Stewart, Bill Simmons, the VICE daily show we think is going to thrive on digital platforms. And then not to leave at Kevin, because he is sitting here, with Griffin Studio, that Warner is focused on short form content also for this kind of environment. So we're basically moving with many avenues into this business.", "Richard Plepler", "Brandon, its Richard. So is that\u2026", "Michael Kopelman", "Brandon, do have another, I can't remember, do you have another question?", "Brandon Ross", "Yes, yes. So my second question for you, Richard, was a year ago you thought all the ISPs would be actively marketing HBO NOW. But it seems like they clearly want to protect their legacy video bundle at all costs.", "Do you think this is why you only have 800,000 HBO NOW subs? And does it alter your thinking about the economic viability of OTT? And does it change your view on ISP consolidation?", "Richard Plepler", "The answer to the last two questions are no and no. Let me make a couple of points. First of all, I wouldn't say only 800,000 HBO NOW subs. We are just getting started, as I said earlier. I think we are going to make a lot of progress as we put new content on and get onto new platforms. And listen, our distributors are selling HBO in a variety of different ways.", "I had dinner with one of our major distributors the other night. We talked about our growth opportunities. Part of the conversation was HBO NOW and they were very excited about it.", "So I reject the notion that our major distributors out of hand don't want to bundle HBO NOW, I don't think that is true. And as our deals come up for renewal I think we will see different kinds of packaging.", "But listen, if they want to sell HBO through skinny bundles, fantastic. If they want to sell HBO through triple plays, fantastic. And I think it is very important to remember that in the last four years we have grown eight million subscribers over the 44\u2026", "Jeff Bewkes", "In just the United States.", "Richard Plepler", "In just the United States. In the 44-year history of our Company that is 20% of our sub growth. What that tells you is, and I have said before, nobody is doing us any favor selling HBO. They're growing their own businesses by using our brand to grow their different companies.", "So, I think this is a win-win. And whether they want to market and bundle NOW or whether they want to do skinny bundles or basic packages or triple plays, there is growth opportunities for them and parenthetical growth opportunities for us. That's what we are excited about.", "Michael Kopelman", "Thanks Brandon, Operator, Mike, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "The last question is from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Jessica Reif Cohen", "Thank you. I have two questions. We've talked a lot on the call about TV windows. Can you discuss how you are thinking about film windows, how they might change and how that would affect both Warner Bros and HBO?", "And the second question is you and all of your peers have talked about the strength of the ad market. What do you think finally drove it back up and how are you feeling going into the upfront market?", "Jeff Bewkes", "Kevin, you start on it.", "Kevin Tsujihara", "On the film window question, I think that similar to the conversation that Jeff had on television windows, we are constantly looking at what consumers are looking for, what consumers are asking for and evaluating how to monetize that demand for content earlier and earlier. We obviously have constituents in the film exhibition community that we are trying to also weigh the impact on that as well.", "But I think that we continue to look at it. I think the industry is looking at it. And it also would affect the pay-TV window. And Richard and I have had a number of conversations about what that would do to that and how HBO would play potentially even in that world as well.", "Jeff Bewkes", "Well, let me add something because Richard it's good for HBO; however, that ends up. And one of the reasons is if films get more available in your home on demand and you have got to look at what kind of price will be yielded by that, it is going to make the movie aspect of premium TV, which HBO has the lead of, more valuable from consumer -- in terms of what consumers value they're going to see what they're getting in the HBO subscription just on the movie side, leave out the original program -- as ever more valuable. That's a good thing.", "Richard Plepler", "Absolutely. I would just add that, because it is often obscured, that our film viewing across all platforms is over 72% of viewing, and on a linear network it is over 77% of viewing. So the truth of the matter is, the film business continues to be an enormous engine of viewership and subscriber satisfaction for HBO.", "John Martin", "Hey Jessica, it's John. So I will take the advertising question. We were really pleased with how strong 2015 ended. And I'm also pleased, as Howard said, that we have seemed to be continuing a meaningful amount of momentum into the first quarter. And I think there were a number of factors, I think some of them are company specific and I think some of them are market specific.", "The company specific factors would be right now our news business is killing it. And we are really taking advantage of the hot news cycle and sports is really strong for us. We're seeing very strong demand for the NBA and for the NCAA men's basketball championship. We are also seeing great strength in the kids market and I think we are taking share there.", "In terms of the overall ad market, I think you are seeing a few things that are contributing to the buoyancy and the vibrancy of the market. Number one, the strength of scatter all throughout 2015 means that if you sat out the upfront you paid for it in the scatter market.", "So we're looking ahead and we think all indicators would seem to suggest that this year's upfront is going to be particularly strong. And I think that is going to reverse what has been a couple of years of being not so strong.", "And I think there is a recognition that TV is still the best reach medium and the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey their message. And so, there is going to be a lot of innovation happening in advertising. We want to lead the market there. But we feel really good about where things are right now.", "Michael Kopelman", "All right, thanks, Jessica. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions please give us a call. Have a great day.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Mike, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right, do we have a line?", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "We do. I think we're actually on now, sorry about the delay with that.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "How do we ask if anybody can hear us?", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Hopefully, if people can hear us, then please go ahead and e-mail us.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Are you going to tell them about our merger with St. Jude Medical?", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "That was our big news, and now you all know why we moved our call to 8:30 in the morning. Good morning, everyone. Sorry about the delay there. Obviously, we've got some time, so hopefully you can all stay with us for the duration of the call.", "I just got a text message saying that you can hear us. So thanks, everyone, and good morning. Welcome to Time Warner's first quarter earnings conference call. This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter and the other reaffirming our 2016 full-year business outlook.", "Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.TimeWarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler, and Kevin Tsujihara, will join us for our Q&A session. Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everybody, for listening in and staying on the call through our medical report at the beginning.", "We told you on our last call that we expected 2016 to be another standout year for Time Warner. And in recent years, as you all know, we've been investing aggressively in the very best content while moving quickly to take advantage of new distribution opportunities that are emerging around the world. At the same time, we've maintained our disciplined approach to cost controls and capital allocation in order to maximize shareholder returns, and we anticipated that that combination would allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading performance. That's exactly what you're seeing in our first quarter results.", "Revenues increased 3% to $7.3 billion, and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share grew 25% to $1.49 per share, and we also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.", "In addition to strong financial results, we're off to a tremendous start this year from a content perspective. In just the past few weeks, we've had the buzzer-beating final game of March Madness on TBS, CNN's must-watch election coverage, a global hit from Warner Bros. in Batman v Superman, and the return of HBO's epic series Game of Thrones. Those are just a few examples of how our investments are translating into great content that deeply engages audiences across platforms and around the world.", "But there are many more. Let me start with Turner. Once again, Turner had three of the top 10 basic cable networks in the U.S. and it continued to make progress on a multiyear transformation of its brands. The first quarter marked the start of TBS's repositioning as the place for young, fresh comedy, with the successful premieres of Angie Tribeca, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, and Separation Anxiety. We followed those up last month with our new hit, The Detour. It's the biggest new comedy on cable this year.", "The early results are very encouraging, with TBS ending the first quarter ranked as the number one ad-supported cable network in primetime among adults 18 to 49. And we have a number of additional distinctive shows on tap this year, including Wrecked, which will debut next month.", "The first quarter also marked the start of an acceleration in Turner's domestic affiliate revenue growth, which we've been talking to you about now for some time. That acceleration underscores the strength of the Turner brands and the investments we've been making in them in recent years. One of our most important investments was March Madness. And last month, Turner brought the championship game of the tournament to cable for the very first time. This year's tournament was another great success, delivering both a stirring finale and record revenue. Recently, we agreed to build on that success by partnering with CBS to extend our television, digital, and marketing rights to the NCAA Tournament all the way through 2032.", "Marquee live sports continue to grow in importance both to consumers and to advertisers. And combined with our extensive multiplatform rights, that gives us a lot of confidence we'll be able to generate a very attractive return on our investment in this unique property.", "As March Madness wound down, the NBA Playoffs were just getting started. The NBA on TNT grew viewership double digits in the first quarter. And with the playoffs underway, we have a great platform for TNT's own drama-focused brand refresh, which starts with Animal Kingdom from Warner Bros. in June.", "Nowhere is Turner's transformation more evident than at CNN, which more than doubled its primetime audience in the first quarter. CNN's ratings benefited from its own reliable coverage of the U.S. presidential race as well as from its continued success with original series. Those two areas overlapped in Race for the White House, which premiered as the most watched CNN original telecast ever.", "Over at Home Box Office, I mentioned Game of Thrones already, which grew its opening night viewership double digits versus a year ago on a cross-platform basis. But it doesn't stop there. That same weekend, HBO was host to Beyonc\u00e9's headline-grabbing visual album, Lemonade, also the television premiere of Jurassic World, a world championship boxing match, and the return of our two hit comedies, Veep and Silicon Valley. It was a great example of the range and quality of the content that HBO delivers to its subs.", "We're just as excited for what's still to come this year at HBO, including the second season of Ballers. That's our new series, started last year; a new series, Divorce, with Sarah Jessica Parker; and our limited series, The Night Of, which just previewed to a tremendous reception at the Tribeca Film Festival.", "At Warner Bros., Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice set a record for a March opening weekend, and it's already Warner's biggest ever first quarter release. Even better, it's only the opening chapter of an exciting slate of DC Entertainment films that we think will captivate audiences globally for years to come. Next up is Suicide Squad this summer, followed by LEGO Batman, Wonder Woman, and Justice League, all in 2017. And as you know, these franchise films are the cornerstone of a strategy that's making DC a growth driver across film, television, digital, games, and consumer products.", "Warner's has a lot more on deck, including J.K. Rowling's return to the big screen this November with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Judging by the huge crowd since the opening last month of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood, there are plenty of fans who are just excited as we are for the next installment of this great franchise.", "In television, Warner's has built on its leading position in broadcast with three of the top five new series this season. That includes not only scripted series like the number one new show, Blindspot, but also unscripted series like Little Big Shots, which has already been picked up in two major international territories. Given the performance of Warner's current shows, with a record 21 renewals ahead of the upfront this year and a strong slate of pilots, Warner's is in a great position to once again lead the industry in broadcast series programming this coming season.", "Now we're also expanding our production for cable and over-the-top [OTT] services. We have twice the number of new series orders for next season. So across the company, we're continuing to lead the way in producing groundbreaking content.", "And to capitalize on the rapid shift to on-demand consumption and broadband delivery of video, we're focused on innovation both in the type of content we produce and how we get it to consumers. For example, on May 24, Turner is launching ELEAGUE. That's our professional competitive gaming league in partnership with WME | IMG.", "In addition to its telecasts on TBS, ELEAGUE will have a significant digital component in partnership with Twitch. ELEAGUE reflects Turner's commitment to creating and delivering content for multi-platform audiences. That commitment is also reflected in Turner's other efforts to grow its presence outside the traditional television ecosystem, particularly in news and sports. CNN finished the quarter as the leading digital news brand in multi-platform video, and Bleacher Report remained number two online sports destination. We'll be ramping up investments in both of these properties over the next couple of years to further expand on their leadership positions.", "HBO is also investing in content geared toward digital audiences by bringing on board talent like Bill Simmons and Jon Stewart. Any Given Wednesday with Bill Simmons does not debut until next month, but Bill is already making his mark with HBO's first after-show, After the Thrones. Like Animals, After the Thrones is debuting first on HBO NOW and HBO GO. We continue to see significant growth in both users and usage of our digital platforms, and we expect that to continue with our recent expansion of HBO NOW to Microsoft's Xbox and to Samsung's smart TVs.", "We're also expanding the reach of HBO's OTT products internationally. In the first quarter, HBO LAG [Latin America Group] launched an OTT service in Mexico, and HBO announced plans for OTT launches later this year in Spain, Brazil, and Argentina. That's all part of a broader push across the company to develop new services and capabilities.", "We talked to you previously about Warner's SVOD [Subscription Video On Demand] investments in Asia. In February, Warner Bros. announced the acquisition of DramaFever to further bolster our OTT capabilities. And just last week, Turner announced its first domestic SVOD service, FilmStruck, which will build on the curation expertise of TCM to target enthusiasts of independent, foreign, and art house films.", "At the same time, we're deeply committed to strengthening our core networks and to helping our traditional distribution and network partners improve their products to satisfy consumers' desire for on-demand content. HBO and Turner have been at the forefront of providing on-demand and multi-platform rights to our partners. And in March, Warner's announced a new deal granting ABC Network in-season stacking rights for its new series.", "So we're making progress on many fronts both inside and outside the traditional ecosystem. We're seeing the benefits of strong execution of our strategy and how that can continue to deliver superior returns for our shareholders. We've also ramped up our investments and our pace of innovation to meet the high expectations of today's and tomorrow's consumers. And that's why we're so confident about the rest of 2016 and beyond.", "Thanks for listening, and let me turn it over to Howard Averill.", "Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website.", "Starting with consolidated results, we're off to a terrific start in 2016, with growth across each of our divisions. And that resulted in a quarterly record for adjusted operating income, which reached over $2 billion, and a 25% increase in adjusted EPS. Total revenues grew 3%, and adjusted operating income was up a very healthy 11%, with margins expanding 200 basis points. And we did that while continuing to grow our investments in programming and marketing at HBO and Turner. That was balanced by lower costs at Warner Bros., mainly due to the timing of our theatrical slate in light of continued company-wide focus on constraining growth and overhead costs.", "And we were able to once again leverage our positive operating results into even faster growth in adjusted EPS. That was partly due to our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter, we bought back $700 million of our shares. And combined with our dividend, we've returned close to $1.3 billion to shareholders year to date. This morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2016 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.40. So we're pleased with how we're executing and have significant operating momentum across our businesses, which gives us great confidence in our outlook for the rest of this year and beyond.", "Now turning to the segment highlights, I'll start at Turner, where the benefit from our domestic affiliate renewal cycle and continued strong advertising performance resulted in our best quarter of revenue growth in almost three years and record adjusted operating income. Subscription revenues were up a strong 11% in the quarter, and that included a close to 300 basis point headwind from FX. Domestic subscription revenues grew close to 15%, as we benefited from the higher rates we achieved in our recent affiliate agreements. Excluding a 15 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth was in the high single digits. While there may be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to a variety of factors, domestic sub revenue growth is on track to be in the low teens for the year, and we expect total subscription revenue growth through the rest of the year to be similar to the first quarter.", "Advertising was up a solid 5%, despite approximately 150 basis points of headwind from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the mid-single digits. That was due to double-digit growth across Turner's linear and digital properties for both news and sports, including strong growth from the NCAA Tournament. International advertising was also healthy in the quarter, up high single digits excluding a close to 15 percentage point drag from FX.", "Looking to the second quarter, scatter pricing at our domestic entertainment networks continues to be up well in the double digits versus the upfront and will benefit from the NCAA Championship Game, while FX remains a headwind. As a result, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits. And with a healthy ad market, the continued rollout of our industry-leading advanced advertising products, and momentum at many of our brands, every indication points to a very strong upfront this year.", "Adjusted operating income increased 10% and margins expanded 100 basis points. And we achieved that even as we continued to invest in programming and marketing, as Turner kept all other expenses close to flat in the quarter. Programming expenses increased 4%, mainly due to our investments in sports and election coverage. And marketing costs were up well into the double digits to support the TBS and TNT rebrands.", "So Turner is off to a terrific start in 2016 and is well positioned for another strong year, and we're confident the investments we're making across our brands will enhance our competitive position and allow us to sustain strong revenue trends and attractive financial results in the future.", "Turning now to HBO, where we continue to see very strong global demand for the product in the form of both subscriber growth and content licensing, domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits, and that included a sequential increase in the benefit from HBO NOW. However, despite year-over-year subscriber growth, we continued to experience headwinds from fewer revenue-generating subscribers at certain MVPDs [Multi-channel Video Programming Distributors], which has been partially driven by M&A activity. Over time, we actually see an opportunity to help those partners grow their businesses while accelerating our own revenue growth.", "Content and other revenue increased 23% in the quarter. That was mainly due to higher international licensing revenues, as HBO continues to benefit from its ability to effectively monetize its original content around the world.", "Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up in the double digits excluding the impact of FX. And international subscriber trends remained strong, with healthy growth across all regions, especially LatAm and Europe.", "Adjusted operating income was up 6% in the quarter, and that was despite a double-digit increase in programming costs as well as continued investments in marketing and technology related to HBO NOW. The increase in programming expense is related to new original programming like Vinyl and Sesame Street as well as programming charges related to series in development.", "Overall, HBO is off to a great start to the year. We're excited about our upcoming programming lineup. And with continued investments in the brand and product, we're in a great position to capitalize on the significant global opportunities for premium services.", "Moving on to Warner Bros., where we posted record first quarter adjusted operating income, on the TV side, we benefited from higher international licensing revenues. And at our Games business, the continued success of our LEGO and Mortal Kombat franchises helped drive another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Despite the strong box office opening of Batman v Superman late in the quarter, total revenues were down modestly due to the difficult theatrical comparisons from last year's release of American Sniper and carryover from the final installment of The Hobbit.", "Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down 12%, as last year's quarter benefited from the home video release of the final Hobbit. Despite the difficult comparisons, EST [Electronic Sell-Through] revenues were still up mid-single digits in the quarter, and we expect our home entertainment trends to improve in the back half of the year as a result of a stronger theatrical slate.", "Adjusted operating income grew close to 30%. In addition to our strong Games performance, we also benefited from lower P&A spending as a result of fewer releases this quarter.", "So Warner Bros. has great momentum, and we're just getting started on the theatrical side with Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them leading what should be a very strong lineup for both the remainder of this year and many years to come. Along with our strength in television and video games, that gives us great confidence in Warner's ability to continue delivering attractive growth well into the future.", "Turning to the next slide, free cash flow totaled over $700 million, which was down from a year ago due to a significant increase in working capital. That was largely related to increased production spend at Warner Bros. as well as the performance of its theatrical product in the fourth quarter of last year and the related impact on accounts receivable. Even so, we still expect very strong cash flow in 2016, driven by strong profit growth and another year of high conversion.", "Now looking at our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up $500 million compared to the end of 2015. That's primarily a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation. We ended the quarter just above our target leverage ratio of 2.75 times, but we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings and are on track to return to our target by the end of this year.", "With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We got off to a strong start in the first quarter, delivering growth across each of our businesses and setting us up for another very good year. That's reflected in our outlook for adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.40, which we reaffirmed this morning. And based on current rates, that includes an estimated $0.10 headwind from foreign exchange.", "Looking ahead, we still expect growth in adjusted OI to be weighted toward the back half of the year. Specifically in the second quarter, we continue to see positive trends in both advertising and subscription revenue, and global demand for our content remains very strong. But there are several items that we expect to weigh on adjusted operating income, including the timing of content licensing revenue, the comparison to strong video games profits at Warner's in last year's quarter, and programming investments at Turner.", "Despite that, we're on track for another year of very healthy growth in adjusted operating income and solid double-digit earnings growth, extending our history of delivering consistently strong operating and financial performance. And with Turner's revenue trends accelerating, HBO positioned to accelerate its subscription revenue growth over the next couple of years, and Warner's in the early stages of an exciting theatrical slate, we feel we're in a great position to continue delivering strong results for many years to come.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Howard. Operator, can we please open the queue for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.", "Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Thanks. I have one for Kevin and then one for Richard. I'm going to hold off my St. Jude's questions for later. Kevin, as Jeff just said, ABC and Warner's announced a deal in March that gives ABC in-season stacking rights to all new series. So I wonder, can you talk about whether or not that's going to be a standard, do you think, for other networks going forward? And then how do your back-end economics \u2013 are affected by giving people more early window rights? What does that mean for your SVOD windows and maybe the second and third windows after that?", "Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.", "We don't think it impacts the back-end value of the rights. We've given Turner stacking rights. We sold stacking rights to FOX last year on Lucifer. And we feel really good about the deal we did with ABC. I can't speak for the rest of the industry, but I know that we are having a number of conversations with all the networks about stacking rights and think that it's certainly a good thing for consumers.", "Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "And will you only sell rights going forward with stacking rights included? Is that your template, or are you flexible depending on what the networks need?", "Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.", "I think each conversation with every network is an individual conversation with them, and so I can't speak for every single show we're going to sell.", "Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay. And then, Richard, we've had a lot of questions about the timing of your next round of affiliate fee negotiations. Can you remind us what percentage of your footprint is coming due over the next few years? And is there any one year in general that's a bigger year for your next round of negotiations?", "Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.", "Michael, look, as we've said before, a large percentage of our deals are up in the next couple of years, some of them toward the end of this year. We think that's a huge opportunity for us because some of the poorer performing affiliates are being acquired by some of the higher performing affiliates, and obviously we see that as a big opportunity going forward for revenue growth. And some of the better performing affiliates, those deals will come up in the next year or so, and we see an opportunity to monetize some of those subs as well. So you can look for the next 18 months to two years for the vast preponderance of our affiliate fees.", "Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Thanks, Richard.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "It comes from the like of Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you. My question is on Turner. You've increased your investments in some of the original programming, which I know you highlighted in your opening comment, with some of these premieres coming out recently. How are you trending I guess on this front? How have they been doing versus your plan, and I guess do you have any overall commentary on the upfront?", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Thanks, Alexia. It's John. Listen, I think we are proceeding exactly on pace with our internal plan. And so if you think about it, Kevin Reilly, as the head of our entertainment networks, has been on the job for about a year, and it's really his new programming slate that's just beginning to roll out.", "We did view 24 new seasons of owned original series on our domestic networks in the first quarter alone, and we have 20 more slated for the second quarter. And these new series hopefully give you a small sense for the bold, high quality and engaging programming that you can expect from Turner going forward. And we're very happy with the critical acclaim and the performance that these new shows are demonstrating across, frankly, all platforms, TV, digital, and social.", "And just to add a little bit more flavor to that, premiering Angie Tribeca in a very new and unique way with a 25-hour commercial-free marathon brought about 36% new young audiences to network. Median age was about 10 years younger than our TBS median. And it continued its success in its regular season run, and it ranked number one on Monday nights across all of cable sitcoms.", "I think it was Jeff that said we couldn't be more pleased than with the success of The Detour, which recently premiered and is reaching over 5 million viewers per episode across all of our TBS platforms, and it's ranked number one of the new comedy releases in adults 18 to 49. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, huge critical and commercial success across all platforms. We're reaching around 3.5 million viewers and we're driving 30 million views on the show's YouTube channel. And that's really just TBS.", "During the first quarter, we had new seasons of Impractical Jokers. And for those who can't actually DV, We Bare Bears and Steven Universe on Cartoon Network, and The Race for the White House and The Eighties on CNN. So we're driving, I think, a general improvement in the quality of our original programming across all of our networks, and we've got a lot more to come. And most notably, the TNT rebrand will begin later this year, and Jeff mentioned some of the shows that we're really excited about.", "With respect to the upfront, I just would reiterate the enthusiasm that Howard suggested, which is that given the strong scatter where we're seeing some of our inventory sell for upwards of 30% to 50% higher than last year's upfront levels. And given low cancellations, we think all signs point to, frankly, the best upfront we will have seen in years. And we think our networks stand to gain at least our fair share of what happens in the upfront. And we think it spells very, very well for just television in general, as television is experiencing resurgence in the minds of brand advertisers, as we're delivering reach and increasing targeting and audience capabilities. So we're very, very optimistic.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "It comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from UBS. Your line is now open.", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks so much, two questions. One, Richard, you noted a lot of affiliate renewals coming up. Can you talk about how the environment for distribution renewals might have changed over time, what the give-and-take in negotiations might be in this next cycle? It seems like you're going in asking for an uplift with all the promotional subs at a higher level than you might have been in the prior cycles.", "And for Kevin Tsujihara, Kevin, it seems you've got a pretty good line of sight on 2016 at this point. When you look out the next few years, do you still see continued strong growth from Warner's, and what are the key drivers of that? Thank you.", "Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.", "It's Richard. Look, I think as I said earlier, a huge opportunity for us going forward because in the higher performing affiliates that are acquiring the weaker affiliates, the blended penetration is below industry average. That gives us an opportunity with our partners to grow together up to the better performing affiliates' penetration levels and beyond. So we see this as an opportunity for them and we see this as an opportunity for us. And listen, all negotiations are difficult, but we think this is going to be a win-win.", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.", "We feel great about our \u2013 can you \u2013 let's move the mic so you can hear. We feel great about the long-term growth of Warner Bros., and we continue to feel that way. We're going to continue to grow, as we said in the past, our leading television business. We have 21 shows, as Jeff mentioned earlier, coming back, and there are still three or four more shows that might also get picked up, and we feel great about our pilots so far.", "We're going to continue to build on the theatrical slate. We love the pipeline, and the foundation is going to be the franchises that we've talked about, DC, Fantastic Beasts, and LEGO. And we're going to continue to focus on margins. We think that we've done a very good job in reducing costs, but we think there's still work to do. So we feel really good about the long-term growth of Warner Bros.", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks, Kevin.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, can we have our next question, please?", "Operator", "It comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. I have two separate questions. The first is for John or \u2013 I guess John. But following up on something Howard said, which was Howard mentioned the advanced advertising array of products, could you talk a little bit about what you're planning to do this year in terms of targeted or advanced advertising? And how different is it for television versus over-the-top? I know this is a long one question. But on over-the-top, will you participate in Hulu or not?", "And then the separate second question is for Kevin. Do you think the sale of DreamWorks Animation will spark mid-size or other studio consolidation? And if yes, will Warner Bros. participate in consolidation?", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Thanks, Jessica. I guess I'll start just taking it in the order that you asked the questions, and I appreciate the question. We're spending a lot of work, a lot of time, investment in increasing our capabilities in advertising. And frankly, we're holding ourselves accountable to lead the charge to modernize TV advertising by combining the unparalleled reach of television and the engagement of TV with the measurement and targeting capabilities of digital. And we are quickly evolving the advertising industry to simultaneously benefit our advertisers as well as improve our overall consumer experience, and we don't see these goals as being mutually exclusive. Frankly, what we're trying to do is combine the best of both TV and digital, uniting scale and targeting with top tier content, and that's one of the reasons why we're very bullish about the upfront.", "In terms of our own new products, we've discussed before that we have built Oracle into Turner Data Cloud, which is the central repository of all of our consumer information. And that's helping us launch new innovative products that focus on analytics, targeting, and ROIs. So just the names of the products, of some of them, we've got individual products called Targeting Now, Audience Now, ROI Now, Provable ROI. And what all that means is that it's going to be targeting audience-based selling coupled with our data cloud and client insights. And I think there are going to be increasing opportunities over time, and that's going to be a major, major focus in our upfronts.", "And then I think you asked specifically with respect to OTT. I think the opportunities to develop advanced targeting capabilities in OTT are absolutely there. They're available. That is assuming that the OTT offering is, in fact, ad-supported. FilmStruck, which is our first domestic offering, is going to be non-ad-supported, which is consistent with Turner Classic Movies. So I think the targeting opportunities will only grow over time, and we're still in the very early stages. So we believe that TV advertising has to evolve, but it's going to remain the most effective option for brand advertisers to convey their message at scale. And that's why we expect a resurgence in TV advertising, beginning at this year's upfront.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So you had a question, there were several points. Is there a Hulu question, Jessica?", "Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "What was it?", "Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Sorry, obviously, Hulu announced this week \u2013 and it can potentially be a really compelling product. And I was just wondering if you envision yourself participating in Hulu and the Hulu over-the-top service.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I see. Okay, let me start. And, John, you may want to fill in. Just maybe, maybe we want our networks in every one of these packages. I think we ought to include that in a larger view of how the industry is evolving. And if you think about subscription VOD, it's been an opportunity that started with the first SVOD service, which is called HBO, a long time ago.", "And what we're watching happen, and I think it probably did start with HBO a decade ago, is consumers want, they expect, they're going to demand SVOD access to all their favorite networks, all their favorite shows. And what we've been seeing as an evolution is the on-demand functionality and better guides are sprouting up, first at HBO, then at some of the broadband delivered services. And increasingly, you're seeing more full on-demand offerings of current exhibition networks and better interfaces, guides, and recommendation engines at places like Comcast, Verizon. Sling has one.", "And for us with our networks, whether it's the Turner networks or the HBO networks, we've long said that we'd like our networks and their programming, including the debuts of current first season exhibitions like what John is talking about and what Richard has been building for years at HBO. We want them to be on-demand. And we would like to see most of our networks, whichever exhibition window, first run or syndication, to be on-demand. And we're basically in an enviable position that our networks, Turner and HBO, are among the most desired networks for consumers and therefore to be included in all these packages.", "So you will hear I think increasingly of different packages with different network offerings that consumers can choose between at different price points available from existing cable, satellite, and telco distributors, increasingly from new virtual distributors, whether it be Hulu, whether it's Amazon, Apple, whoever comes in and creates packages for consumers. So I think what you're seeing is a very vibrant rebirth of the strength of TV networks and TV programming across all of these distribution platforms. And because of our \u2013 we've always taken the position, being the first to launch VOD, that we think more of it is better for consumers, and therefore we're going to try to be available in all the packages consumers are interested in.", "Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.", "As it relates to the DreamWorks Animation transaction, I don't think you're going to see significantly more consolidation. That being said, the business is getting more and more stratified. Big franchises are more valuable than ever. But I don't think there's a lot of those that are actually available at this point in time. And so I don't think that that's going to be a precursor to a lot of transactions.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "One thing I should add; I should have said it. Let's not limit the VOD transformation to the United States. You're seeing very strong SVOD proliferation all over the world. And whether it's the Warner Tencent venture in China, whether it's some of our HBO overseas VOD services, whether it's companies like Sky and others in the UK, and in South America they're launching VOD, whether it's networks or programming, we're seeing our stuff going into all of these new platforms. And it's raising the value not only of our content if you think of it show by show, but also of our networks.", "Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Jeff, one last follow-up, but is it all television, or do you think this is film-based as well?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You mean SVOD exhibition of films, because you have certainly have had that for more than a decade on HBO.", "Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "But not so much outside the U.S.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, you do. Kevin, you can add. You've got film licensing on SVOD all over the world.", "Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.", "Yes, I think you're seeing \u2013 it's a critical component of any SVOD offering that wants to be at scale, be it either movies and television.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And let's remember, and we've tried to make this point over and over. The SVOD exhibition \u2013 or the VOD exhibition is not just on what you think of as an SVOD service. It's also in what used to be thought of as traditional TV services that become on-demand services.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Jessica. Operator, can we have our next question, please?", "Operator", "That comes from the line of Michael Morris from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, guys, two Turner-related questions. First on the affiliate fee growth, several of your peers see impact from the distributor consolidation and some rate resets dragging on their growth. Obviously, you're putting up great growth right now. Do you expect to have any impact in the future from consolidation? Is any impact of consolidation already in your results, or perhaps the way you're structured you won't be impacted by that?", "And then my second question is on ELEAGUE, specifically most strategies we see as taking linear content and finding new digital avenues. This is a case where you're taking something that's done well digitally and you're bringing it to TV. Could you just talk a little bit about why you think that's the right strategy, what your hopes are for that product? Thanks.", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Sure. Thanks, Mike. Look, with respect to our affiliate fees, I think the forecast or the guidance that we provided for this year and next year where we expect domestic subscriber revenues to be in the low teens, I think it's fair to say that that considers the current environment of the number of distributors and what's happening in the marketplace. So when you have a highly concentrated portfolio of must-have networks, which we do, where we've got 85% of our affiliate revenues in four networks, I think it's a really advantageous place to be. So I think I'll leave it at that because obviously we're not going to specifically comment on any particular consolidation.", "And then with respect to ELEAGUE, look, this is one of the innovations with respect to content that I think we're particularly excited about and proud of. And it's really not necessarily by design that we're looking to take digital content and move it to the TV. It's more just really trying to position the company to be where consumers are. And in looking at secular growth areas and in looking at areas where particularly young people are spending tremendous amounts of time, you obviously have to pay attention to the gaming industry. But this whole notion of a very significant population of individuals who are really excited to sit and watch professional gamers and some of the best gamers in the world, that's already happening. It's happening globally. In some countries, it represents some of the highest levels of consumption of video content. So in some respects, having ELEAGUE be aired on TBS is somewhat of an experiment. I think we're going to learn a lot this year. And I look forward to hopefully building a big franchise and a big asset along with our partners on both TV and digital platforms.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Mike.", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thanks, John.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, can we have our next question, please?", "Operator", "Your line comes from Vasily Karasyov from CLSA. Your line is now open.", "Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thank you, good morning. John, I have a couple quick ones for you on Turner. I think in Jeff's remarks, he said that sports was up in advertising and news. Can you tell us what the advertising for entertainment at TBS ex-sports is with Turner?", "And also, my question is you spoke in answering Alexia's question about what went right at Turner. Is there anything that you think will be changing in the next TV seasons and how you approach things? Thank you.", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Terrific, let me start with the last part. Listen, I think, to be completely candid, not everything goes right in any of our businesses. But...", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Wait, really?", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "But I have to say we are off to a terrific start. And at this moment, I can't think of a thing that if we were to look backwards that we would do differently, and really excited about looking forward. I think you should expect us not only to continue to produce high-quality compelling programming, but to try to rebrand these networks into \u2013 continue to be must-have distinctive destinations for original programming, acquired programming, and sports. And so I couldn't be more proud of the team under David [Levy] and Kevin's direction and where we stand today and where we're going. So the simple answer is really pleased, wouldn't really want to change a thing.", "Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "In terms of advertising...", "Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC", "And advertising and ratings for entertainment ex-sports and news?", "Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, so I would say across the portfolio most of the growth did come from both news and sports, which is why we have that diverse portfolio. Ratings on the entertainment networks, the audience levels were down a bit, and the scatter pricing was not enough to offset that. But in aggregate, overall domestic entertainment advertising was fine.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Vasily.", "Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thank you.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "It comes from the line of Vijay Jayant from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI", "Thanks, just a question for Richard. I just wanted to understand. As HBO NOW is a stand-alone product, trying to be an all-encompassing product for a consumer, is there an optimal amount of content you expect in terms of new originals every year, split between comedies, dramas, kids? And as you go international, how much local content do you need to make that a viable or a successful product rather? And where are we on that transition, if there is one? Thank you.", "Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.", "In terms of how we aggregate our programming decisions, I think as you look at the network right now, you see a textbook example of how we break up different genres, documentaries, mini-series, half-hours, hours, original films, sports programming. And as I've said before, the mission of programming is to build as many addicts as we can out there in the consumer base. And different people love different things. So you have huge Silicon Valley fans, huge John Oliver and Bill Maher fans, huge sports fans. So we like the way we're breaking up our choices. And a lot of this of course is informed by the talent that comes through the door. If somebody comes in with a brilliant idea for an additional half-hour, we're not going to say no to it because we have a certain number that we think is a ceiling. That's not how we make choices.", "In terms of HBO NOW, what we have done is we've augmented our programming with decisions like Jon Stewart and Vice News and I think Bill Simmons will work across all platforms. So again, that opportunity to not be constrained by schedule is opening up a lot of creativity on the part of our talent who are coming in literally every week with new ideas. So you're going to see more and more of that going forward.", "So listen, we like our mix. We think if you look at just the Emmy nominations and the Emmy wins of last year, I think the thing that was most rewarding for us was that they were across all categories, a wide range of categories, and I think that's what makes our programming mix so special.", "Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI", "If I can try my luck, any update on HBO NOW subscriber numbers?", "Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.", "I'm not going to get into numbers other than to say that we've had a good start with sub growth this year, both in terms of the traditional ecosystem and NOW, and we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. And as we learn more and more about our subscribers and our marketing becomes more precise, particularly with NOW, I think we're going to do even better.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Vijay. Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "It comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Your line is now open.", "Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question, just one question for Howard. Howard, the company had a really strong quarter across the board, beating Street estimates by a lot. But just on the outlook, you didn't raise the outlook. So totally hear you on the 2Q items you mentioned in your prepared remarks. But is this just a little bit of conservatism, or has the visibility around the rest-of-year expectations changed at all as you look segment by segment? Thanks.", "Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We had a terrific first quarter, again, with a double-digit OI and the 25% EPS growth. We are really pleased with how we're executing, and we see that continuing across our businesses. But look, it's still early in the year. We did mention, and you just mentioned back, the fact that we are making some investments across the business. And look, we're also mindful that FX can move around. So at this point, we're still comfortable with the $5.30 to $5.40, and we are on track clearly for that.", "Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Thanks a lot.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Anthony. Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "It comes from the line of John Janedis from Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you. Jeff, maybe a follow-up to your comment on SVOD and related distributors or offerings. From your perspective, how do you think about the potential for them to expand or stabilize the pay TV universe relative to the declines over the past 18 months or so? Or maybe asked differently, do you have any line of sight or confidence in improved sub trends as a result of new entrants or offerings?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's important to look basically to de-aggregate the performance in the cable/telco/satellite world. So you do have affiliates, cable affiliates who are growing subs and penetration. And the reason basically is they're offering very effective packages of VOD. They've got various packages at different prices with different network bundles for consumers. They've got good guide interfaces. And so you have a fairly large disparity in performance between distributors. And I think if you look at the high performers, you see where the future can go. And the fact you that now have more VOD offerings and different packages and price points is basically, I think, and we've seen it happen, it's going to increase penetration because consumers are going to find more packages that suit what they want. And in most cases, that will be the biggest and largest packages of the big networks, but not in all cases.", "And so I think you're going to see \u2013 and remember, to the extent have you some marketing of VOD products, think of broadband delivery with good navigation, it basically increases consumer demand, consumer recognition for powerful networks like CNN, TNT, HBO. All of that has a national effect of increasing the presence of TV networks because all age groups increasingly now are finding their favorite programs offered the way they want, and they find their way to the networks if we sell them in the right distribution offering.", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Can I just say one thing? There are too many networks in the United States. And we've been saying for years that there's going to be a rationalization of those networks. So as you think about subscription trends going forward, I think there are going to be increasingly differentiated subscription trends, meaning that marginal or lesser-valued networks are going to find it very difficult to keep their footing and keep pace with the best networks. And I think further to what Jeff just said, as affiliates, whether they're traditional or non-traditional affiliates, put out packages \u2013 smaller packages of better networks at lower economic price points, we're going to be able to attract back households into the multi-channel ecosystem that have frankly moved away because they don't see the value of the uber-bundles. That will be good for us.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. And then maybe separately, just back to HBO for a second, with Game of Thrones premiering a week or two ago, can you talk about your confidence in the slate's ramping and accelerating subscriber growth the rest of the year, and to what extent maybe the programming budget is locked in or may need to move higher? And on HBO NOW, that you're a year in, can you share some data on how the subs are different from traditional linear subs from either maybe a churn or engagement perspective? Thanks you.", "Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.", "Sure, the second first. Obviously, it's a younger demo. It's about a decade younger than our traditional HBO sub.", "In terms of the programming slate, look, we're very excited about what's coming, Vice Principals with Danny McBride, Sarah Jessica Parker's Divorce, our co-production with Warner Bros., Westworld, just an extraordinary varied and dynamic slate of stuff coming. And Game of Thrones also has a couple of years left as well before they finish out their story.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "Richard, do HBO NOW subs churn more, or is it negligible?", "Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.", "Look, as we saw in the Nordics, churn was a bit elevated initially. But as you would expect, the churn has been coming down as our subscriber base has aged. And I think as we continue to drive churn down over time, we improve the service, we improve our UI and UX, we roll out more of the programming that I spoke of earlier, I think we'll learn and we are learning how to better serve our customer and continue to effect a decline in churn.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, John. Operator, we have time for one more question, please.", "Operator", "It comes from the line of Bryan Kraft from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, good morning. I had a question for Richard and for John. Richard, just a question on HBO, following up on John's question. How do you gauge what is a successful show on HBO versus an unsuccessful one? Is there a minimum audience level that you're looking for?", "And then for John, John, I'm just curious. How is the reduction in ad loads at truTV going to impact pricing and audience levels for advertising on the network? Do you see the increase in CPMs and ratings offsetting the reduction in ad loads? Thank you.", "Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.", "On your question of how we gauge a successful show, look, it's largely about whether we think something is elevating the brand, and that's obviously a subjective judgment that we make all the time. It's not so much about rating as whether or not it's serving what we think is its design purpose to affect resonance with a particular part of our consumer base. So as I said earlier, it's all about developing a kind of engagement with our subscriber. Some people are going to look at Real Sports with the same degree of passion that other people look at Bill Maher or John Oliver. Some people are going to look at Veep with the same passion that other people will look at Silicon Valley.", "So this is a very subjective determination. We've been doing it for a long time. We think we have pretty good instincts about how to build a large variety in our slate which appeals to a huge part of our consumer base. There's no exact science to it. Obviously, critical acclaim plays a role. But we have a very good collective instinct inside the company when we think something is resonating with a particular part of our audience. And we give our creative teams an opportunity to stay with it and develop story and continue to build the show, as we've shown over many years.", "Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks.", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Thanks, it's John. With respect to \u2013 for anybody who's unaware, because you made reference to truTV and ad loads, we had announced a number of months ago our intention that beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, we're going to essentially take the number of minutes per hour on truTV dedicated to advertising, and we're going to essentially cut it in half. And that again is consistent with our desire to evolve the industry. That's going to simultaneously benefit our advertisers and improve the overall consumer experience.", "I will tell you we are not doing it to lose money. So we fully intend to provide increased value per inventory unit that we sell. And now it's up to you to us to demonstrate that, but we are actively going to be moving beyond the 30-second spot business to create innovative new ad products for our advertisers and marketers. And we made a number of announcements a number of months ago at CES, including Native Plus with longer-form brand ad breaks, and Launchpad, which is a social tool, and Courageous, which is our own in-house ability to develop branded content in the form of advertising. Again, I would say we're going to learn a lot, but we absolutely believe that this experiment is not going to result in us taking a step back.", "Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I just wanted to see if I could follow up on that. John, how are you thinking about the ad loads on the other networks? Do you first do this with truTV, see what you learn, and then start thinking about the larger networks, or is there anything that you're doing now in terms of ad load reductions on TBS and TNT?", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "We're not doing anything material today. And one of the reasons why we are starting with this commitment on truTV is obviously it's a network where we have less advertising exposure than some of our larger networks like TBS and TNT. Having said that, the type of approach and ideology that we have with truTV, which we think will succeed, we're already beginning to plan for on some of our other networks, and I believe it was Kevin Reilly at TCA [Television Critics Association] that mentioned that on some of our new original programming, we're actually going to be making more minutes of content, with the expectation that on a number of those new original scripted series, we'll probably be running fewer ad commercial breaks. So this is going to be an evolution, but it's something that we're planning now for what's going to take place in the future.", "Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks to you both.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I just want to thank everyone for hanging in through our medical section and hope you can all see how we're so excited about not only our prospects for the business this year but in the years out beyond that. We think the company is very well positioned, and the evolution at the networks, at Warner's is going global, is proceeding as well as I could have hoped. And I'm also seeing a lot of encouragement in industry developments. I think the industry around the world is finally starting to catch up to the innovation speed necessary to take this huge value that's resident in all the network offerings, not just ours, and bring it to consumers in the way that consumers increasingly want. So we're quite encouraged about the environment that we're operating in and particularly our strength relative to the others.", "Michael Kopelman - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, everybody.

LLC", "Operator", "Welcome to the Time Warner, Inc. Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Holscott, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mrs. Holscott, you may now begin.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Rob, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's second quarter earnings conference call. This morning we issued three press releases; one detailing our results for the second quarter, one updating our 2016 full year business outlook, and the third announcing Time Warner's agreements with Hulu, including making an equity investment.", "Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at timewarner.com. Reconciliations of expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.", "Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on the 10-Q.", "Time Warner is under no obligation and is in fact expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO, who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO. After the prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara will join us for our Q&A session.", "With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jessica. Thanks everybody for listing in this morning. We're about halfway through the year and we're well on our way to exceeding our original 2016 goals. At the same time, we've been making the necessary investments in the very best video content and the development of new and exciting distribution opportunities in order to continue driving industry-leading growth over the long term. In the quarter, we generated revenues of $7 billion and adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion. And adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.29 per share. We also returned over $1 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Our financial results continue to be fueled by creative excellence across our divisions.", "Since we last spoke with you, we received 148 Primetime Emmy nominations, that's more than any other company, with HBO's 94 again setting the pace for the industry. TNT and TBS finished the second quarter as the two highest graded cable networks in primetime. With TNT airing cables most viewed NBA telecast of all time and Warners once again came out of the upfront as the leading supplier to the broadcast network. We expect that momentum to continue this weekend with the opening of Suicide Squad, one of the summer's most anticipated movies.", "Our results also reflect the consistent execution of a strategy that we've been discussing with you for years. A core part of that strategy is to ensure that our networks, our shows and our brands are available to consumers on a wide range of platforms and devices and in all-important bundles, both within the traditional ecosystem and outside of it. With state-of-the-art user interfaces and more and more on-demand functionality. Now in many cases, we'll simply extend our traditional wholesale model of licensing our content and networks to third parties, but we are also investing in new services, both wholly-owned and with partners that have a more direct relationship with consumers. In doing that, we're positioning ourselves to develop new revenue streams for our industry-leading brands.", "Among our initiatives is to-date, HBO NOW is the most significant and the second quarter was its strongest yet. But even HBO NOW is just one of many investments and initiatives in this area. HBO has launched similar services in the Nordic region and in parts of Latin America with additional launches scheduled for later this year. At Turner, we're in the process of launching an arthouse film SVOD service called FilmStruck which follows the recent launches of SVOD services by Adult Swim in Canada and Esporte Interativo in Brazil. And those join short form digital content initiatives like Great Big Story and Super Deluxe. And over at Warner's, the SVOD service we partnered on in China with Tencent video VIP recently passed 10 million subscribers. We've also enhanced our broadband distribution capabilities with acquisitions like iStreamPlanet and DramaFever.", "This morning, we announced another exciting next step in that strategy, and that's our investment in Hulu. This investment fits our strategy like a glove. It will increase our company's exposure to the secular growth in over-the-top services, and it will give Hulu more resources to offer consumers more shows and more choices, fostering competition and innovation amongst both SVOD services and among MVPD services. We also announced that the virtual MVPD service Hulu expects to launch early next year will include live and on-demand access to the full suite of Turner networks. Consumers clearly want innovative interfaces. They want more robust on-demand capabilities, and they expect a greater variety of content packages. And we want to support services that do just that.", "So consistent with our strategy, our investment in Hulu leaves us free to continue to support fully, as we always have, other traditional and broadband delivered distribution platforms. We look forward to working closely with our existing MVPD partners and with existing and new over-the-top partners in bringing consumers more choice in how to access our best-in-class shows and networks. We expect there will be a number of additional virtual MVPDs that launch over the coming year, and we think that the increase in choices available as a result of these new services will be great both for consumers and for our industry-leading brands.", "Speaking of brands, let me share a few more highlights from the past quarter that show how our investments in Turner's core brands are helping transform its business by driving increased engagement with audiences across both traditional and new platforms. Here in the US, Turner had three of the top five ad-supported cable networks in prime time among adults 18 to 49. That's TNT, TBS, and Adult Swim. And Adult Swim, which continues to be far and away the most watched by millennials. It attracts 60% more 18- to 34-year-olds than its nearest competitor, 60% more.", "Now we've talked before about the bold programming refresh underway at both TBS and TNT, and we couldn't be happier with the initial results. We've launched five marquee originals across TBS and TNT in this year, and we've already renewed all of them. Together, Wrecked, Angie Tribeca, The Detour, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, and Animal Kingdom are great examples of where we're taking the TBS and TNT brands, and they've all surpassed our expectations for our initial slate of new shows.", "We're particularly pleased with the audience growth we've seen from Samantha Bee and Animal Kingdom since their launches, and we're also gratified by the strong positive response that we've had from the gaming community to the launch of ELEAGUE. That's our eSports initiative.", "The strong demand we saw in the upfront clearly demonstrated the belief advertisers have in the direction we're moving in and in the value of our brands, and that translated into double-digit CPM increases for Turner's entertainment networks. We also benefited from Turner's continued innovation in advertising products, with our targeting analytics capability setting the pace for the industry.", "Demand in the upfront was particularly strong for CNN, which has undergone nothing short of a renaissance over the past few years. To date, 2016 is the most-watched year in CNN's history and as the US presidential election draws closer, CNN continues to gain momentum and take share from its peers. CNN was the number one news \u2013 let me say this very clearly, CNN was the number one news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time for the third consecutive quarter, and CNN Digital becomes the number one news service in multi-platform and mobile uniques.", "During the conventions of the past two weeks, both conventions, CNN led all networks, broadcast and cable alike, in viewership. And while CNN's in-depth news coverage continues to lead the industry, it's also building its next generation of viewers with a strong lineup of originals and leading digital products.", "We're just excited about the momentum at HBO, which once again proved it's without peer when it comes to premium content. It's 94 Emmy nominations led the industry for the 16th straight year and included nominations for Game of Thrones for outstanding drama and both Veep and Silicon Valley for outstanding comedy, as well as John Oliver and Bill Maher for outstanding variety talk show.", "HBO's status as the gold standard for premium content was also reinforced by the response to the most recent season of Game of Thrones, which averaged over 25 million viewers per episode. That's more than 25% higher than last year's record, and it's nothing less than astounding if you consider HBO's sub base. Much of that growth was driven by its digital platforms, where viewership nearly doubled from a year ago. Our digital platforms also contributed to double-digit growth for Veep and Silicon Valley, both of which reached series highs.", "We've been thrilled with the overwhelming critical and consumer response to the limited crime series The Knight Of, which will be followed up this fall by the much-anticipated sci-fi series, Westworld, from Warner Bros. and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker to HBO in Divorce.", "So we couldn't feel better about HBO's content lineup. The strength of the HBO content and brand have been evident in the growth of HBO NOW, and we're looking to super serve that audience by introducing new content geared for our digital and on-demand platforms. That started with the debut of Bill Simmons' Any Given Wednesday that happened in June, and we're going to follow that with the VICE News Tonight and John Stewart's highly original and much-anticipated new project later this year.", "Now let me turn to Warner Bros., which remains on track for another record year as it continues to take advantage of its iconic IP with a franchise-driven strategy that spans television, film, and games. The strength of our great IP at Warners was evident this quarter in the performance of Warners television, which is once again leading the industry.", "For the 2016 to 2017 season, Warner TV is set to be the number one producer of broadcast shows for the thirteenth time in the last 14 seasons. With 31 series, 22 of which are returning. That's the highest returning series number in the company's history.", "Across all networks and services, Warner Bros. will produce 65 series for the upcoming year. That includes 10 shows originating in the DC Comics universe, underscoring the importance of the DC franchise to our television business, but DC is also critical component for video games business, which coming off a record performance last year just had its being biggest LEGO launch ever.", "We're going to follow that up next month with Batman: The Telltale Series from our publisher at Telltale Games. Batman is also the star of Batman Arkham VR. That's our first virtual reality game. Arkham VR will be one of the launch titles for PlayStation VR, and it's Batman like you have never seen him before because you basically are him. It's a great example of how great IP translates across many different platforms and experiences, and it underscores the strength of our competitive position as new platforms continue to emerge.", "On the Theatrical side, we are starting to build some real momentum with the recent string of highly profitable performers in Me Before You, Central Intelligence and Conjuring 2. Conjuring 2 has already past $300 million at the global box office, and it's become one of the most successful horror franchises in history. And we're thrilled with the recent opening of Lights Out. That's another micro-budget horror hit from New Line. Looking forward, Suicide Squad is tracking to be the biggest opening ever for an August release.", "So we're already well on our way to what we think will be a blockbuster second half performance for our theatrical business. We follow Suicide Squad with War Dogs, a raucous comedy from Todd Phillips starring Jonah Hill and Bradley Cooper that will debut later this month. And next month, we'll have the inspiring story of Sully from Clint Eastwood starring Tom Hanks and Storks, a charming movie from Warner Animation.", "Later this year, we will all have a chance to return to the Wizarding World created by J.K. Rowling when Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them hits theaters. Months ahead of its release, excitement about the franchise is already building. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which is J.K. Rowling's first stage production, recently opened, and it's already sold out through next May. The book version of the play script was released last week, and it had the most preorders of any title at Barnes & Noble since the last Harry Potter book was released in 2007. And the opening of the Harry Potter \u2013 Hogsmeade attraction at Universal Hollywood has been really well received, driving significant increases in audience.", "That all sets the stage for the November release of Fantastic Beasts, a stunning new chapter in J.K.'s continuing saga. We couldn't be more excited, and as Warner announced earlier today, the second installment of the series is already set for release in November 16, 2018.", "So we're in the midst of a very vibrant content cycle here across our businesses, and that puts us in a great position to benefit as global demand for the best video content continues to rise. We're making a lot of progress, both in strengthening our position within the traditional ecosystem and building new revenue streams and capabilities outside. And our investment in and Turner's agreement with Hulu is just another example of how we're taking advantage of new platforms to serve consumers, increase competition and further grow our business.", "We're seeing increased value accrue to the very strongest brands and to the very best video content, and along with that come new opportunities that arise from digital distribution all around the world. And that's why we're very confident about the rest of 2016 and well beyond. Thanks for listening. Let me turn it over to Howard who has the fantastic financial details to give you.", "Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first side of our presentation which is now available our website. Starting with consolidated results, we're pleased with our operating and financial performance to date and we're on track to exceed the outlook we provided at the start of the year.", "Through the first half of the year adjusted operating income was up 3% and adjusted EPS was up 14%, and we delivered that while making significant investments not only in our traditional businesses but also in new capabilities and revenue streams that will drive future growth.", "We knew coming into the second quarter that we faced difficult comparisons from the timing of content licensing revenue across our divisions, last year's record gains performance at Warner's and the timing of programming investments at both Turner and HBO. So as we expected, both revenues and adjusted operating income were down in the quarter.", "Even so, we were able to keep adjusted operating income margins for the quarter steady year-over-year at 25%. That reflected our mix of revenue, a positive swing in eliminations, and our continued company-wide focus on limiting growth in overhead costs, which were roughly flat in the quarter.", "Adjusted EPS was up 3%. That's primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and the benefit of our ongoing share repurchase program. During the second quarter, we bought back around $700 million of our shares and paid close to $320 million in dividends. And year-to-date, we returned about $2.3 billion to shareholders.", "So we had a strong first half and we feel great about how this year is shaping up. As a result, we raised our outlook for 2016 adjusted EPS which we now expect to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. I'll touch on more of the details of our outlook later in the presentation.", "Now turning to the segment highlights, I'll start at Turner where the investments we've been making in the transformation of our core brands contributed to another quarter of very strong revenue growth. Subscription revenues once again grew 11% in the quarter, and that included approximately 150 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic subscription revenues were up in the low-teens as we continued to benefit from the rate increases we achieved during our affiliate renewal cycle. And excluding a close to 10 percentage point drag from FX, international subscription revenue growth would have been in the high-single digits.", "Advertising revenues increased a solid 6% despite approximately 100 basis points of headwinds from FX. Domestic advertising grew in the high-single digits, marking the third consecutive quarter of healthy growth. That reflected another quarter of double-digit growth in both news and sports, which included the benefit from airing the NCAA National Championship game for the first time this year. International advertising would have been up mid-single digits excluding a close to 10 percentage point drag from FX.", "Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect total advertising revenue growth to be in the low-single digits. The scatter market remains healthy with pricing at our domestic entertainment networks pacing up well into the double-digits over last year's upfront. At the same time, we're going to air significantly fewer hours of original programming across our domestic entertainment networks, and that's partially an effort to stay out of the way of this year's Summer Olympics. The third quarter is also our lightest quarter for sports inventory, and FX remains a headwind.", "Moving on, content and other revenues declined 15% in the quarter. That reflects lower licensing revenues due to the comparison of last year's deal with Hulu. Adjusted operating income was flat in the quarter as healthy revenue growth was balanced by continued investments in programming and marketing. Programming expenses increased 11% mainly due to higher sports costs, including the NCAA National Championship game I mentioned earlier and our continued investment in bold, new original programming as part of the rebrand at TBS and TNT. Marketing costs were up mid-teens to support those new original series.", "Overall, Turner has great operating momentum and is well-positioned to maintain its strong revenue trends in the second half of the year, putting it on track for another year of solid growth. We're doing that while continuing to make important investments in new initiatives like iStreamPlanet, expanding Bleacher Report and CNN's digital products. And together, we think the investments we're making across the business will allow Turner to deliver attractive results over the long-term as well.", "Turning to HBO, where we're pleased with the progress we're making as we continue to invest in the significant global opportunity in subscription video services. Domestic subscription revenue growth was in the mid-single digits in the quarter, and that included a continued sequential increase in the contribution from HBO NOW, where we remain encouraged with our progress.", "Content and other revenues decreased 17% in the quarter, mainly due to lower revenues from our licensing deal with Amazon. That was balanced by solid growth in international licensing revenues, highlighting our ability to effectively monetize our original programming around the world.", "Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double-digits, and that's a reflection of continued positive international subscriber trends, especially in Latin America and the Nordics.", "Adjusted operating income fell 5% in the quarter, and that reflects higher programming expenses, including programming charges and restructuring and severance costs. The programming charges and restructuring and severance costs totaled approximately $100 million, and that's largely related to a change in leadership on the programming front.", "Separately, after considering consumer viewing patterns, including increased on-demand access to HBO's content across a wide range of devices and services, we have updated our estimates of the period over which our original programming is used. As a result, most of HBO's original programming will now be amortized over a somewhat longer time period. That reduced amortization this quarter by approximately $95 million. So the combination of reduced amortization, programming charges and restructuring and severance costs did not have a material effect on adjusted operating income in the quarter.", "While there will be some impact from reduced amortization in the second half of 2016, most of this benefit was recognized in the second quarter. Excluding the programming charges and benefit from the reduced amortization, programming costs increased in the teens in the quarter, and that was driven primarily by increased investments in original programming.", "Looking forward, we're excited about our upcoming programming lineup and combined with the continued investments we're making in the brand and product, we think HBO is very well-positioned to drive substantial growth in the years to come.", "Moving on to Warner Bros., where we're also making progress on our multi-year strategy to drive growth across theatrical, television, and games. Coming into the year, we planned for our theatrical business to be the primary driver of profit growth, and that's playing out as we expected through the first half of the year. Looking specifically at the second quarter, we knew we had very difficult comparisons. Last year's quarter was a record for our video games business, led by the successful releases of franchise titles Batman: Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X, and we had significant TV licensing revenues from The Big Bang Theory and Seinfeld.", "We also had fewer theatrical home video releases and a very difficult comparison against American Sniper and carryover revenues from the final installment of The Hobbit. So as expected, both revenue and adjusted operating income declined in the quarter.", "In theatrical, we saw significant benefit from carryover revenue from Batman v Superman. We've also been really pleased with the theatrical performance of more recent releases like The Conjuring 2 and Central Intelligence. And The Legend of Tarzan has already surpassed $300 million in global box office. So while we originally had higher hopes for the film, we do not expect it to have a material impact on profits this year.", "Looking ahead, we're very optimistic about the upcoming theatrical releases of Suicide Squad and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them as we continue to lay the groundwork for our multi-year franchise film slate. Combined with the healthy trends and a leading position in TV production and the opportunities at its games business, Warner's is set up to continue delivering strong growth both this year and well into the future.", "Turning to the next slide. Free cash flow totaled about $1.9 billion in the first half. That's up from a year ago, largely due to growth in adjusted operating income. Working capital also benefited from the payment of $280 million associated with the CME refinancing. And that was mostly offset by increased content investments, driven by higher production spending at Warner Bros. Given our performance to date and our expectation for strong growth in adjusted operating income, we're on track for another year of very strong free cash flow in 2016.", "Now looking at our balance sheet. Since our last call, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to strengthen our balance sheet by issuing $800 million of long-term debt at an attractive rate. And we ended the second quarter with $22 billion of net debt, up around $350 million compared to the end of 2015. That's mostly a result of our ongoing commitment to direct returns to shareholders, which is a key component of our balanced approach to capital allocation.", "Looking at investments, we did a very modest amount of M&A in the first half, and as Jeff noted, yesterday we invested $583 million for a 10% stake in Hulu. That payment will hit in the third quarter. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was just above our target leverage ratio of around 2.75 times, which we're on track to return to by the end of this year. And we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings.", "With that, let's move on to the final slide, which looks at our outlook for 2016. We had a solid first half of the year, and we're really pleased with how we're executing across our businesses. And that's reflected in our updated outlook for 2016. As I mentioned earlier, we raised our outlook for adjusted EPS this year to $5.35 to $5.45. And that incorporates around a $0.06 negative impact related to our equity investment in Hulu, including both our share of the losses and PPA.", "Turning to the back half of the year, we expect overall revenue growth to accelerate, and that should help drive a nice acceleration on adjusted operating income growth as well.", "Looking specifically at the third quarter, we anticipate elevated programming cost growth at HBO from the rollout of new original programming like The Night Of and Vice Principals and the timing of theatric availabilities and we'll again face challenging comparisons in video games and TV licensing at Warner Bros. As a result, we anticipate growth in adjusted operating income to be weighted heavily to the fourth quarter.", "So overall, we're on track for another year of very attractive growth, and we believe the significant operating momentum, positive revenue trends and continued investments we're making across the company position us to continue that growth well into the future.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Howard. Can we open up the line for Q&A, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes. Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question today is coming from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Thanks. I have one for Jeff and one for Howard. Jeff, following up on the Hulu investment last night and all you said in the past about windowing and the stacking rights and the need to keep those rights out of SVOD until later in the cycle, I wonder, what was the thinking on recent CW deal with Netflix which gave a lot of Netflix the rights right after the broadcast window ended? So what changed in your thinking relative to The CW versus what you said before?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm not \u2013 I don't think you've characterized what we said before, right? I'll start and Kevin will pick it up. The CW is in a different situation than many other networks or our cable networks in that it doesn't currently receive material carriage fees. And so we made the decision this year not to have an in-season digital partner, which essentially goes along with what we've been thinking, and we instead put more aggressive VOD rights and stacking rights on The CW for the current season. Let's focus on that first, Kevin, and then let's go to the follow-on.", "Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.", "The CW is the unique asset, because you don't \u2013 not only do you not get material retrans, but we also don't own any. Time Warner doesn't own, but CBS owns some but predominantly don't own the station group that it's being played on. And therefore it has slightly different economics than the other broadcast networks. But what we did was actually give The CW more stacking rights by giving it exclusivity in the year. It has a lot more flexibility in its ability to be able to convey a full season or any number between a full season and five episodes. So it can do, it has a lot more flexibility than it had in the prior deal when The CW had a Hulu in-season deal and a Netflix out of season deal.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And let me just add to the philosophical side. Let's all look at the way this actually works and it's working the way it should work. Consumers want, and they expect \u2013 particularly for series, where they pick up the series maybe in its first year, maybe some other place \u2013 they want more on-demand access to the series, particularly series that become serialized plots over a long period of time. So as consumers want that, networks \u2013 and it depends which kind of networks and what kind of shows \u2013 networks increasingly want to offer more VOD rights over more episodes to cover story arcs.", "So if you look at, for example, networks like in HBO or Showtime, or lately the Netflix business, Amazon. Those kind of networks with their serialize shows have had for years multiple, many episodes going back over long periods of time so you can catch up with the show. If you go to the ad-supported networks, broadcast, cable networks, et cetera, they have been on a path to try to meet consumer demand, and to the extent consumers want to see their favorite show over longer story arcs of episodes, networks increasingly ask for that.", "So if you take, say, some of the broadcast networks \u2013 Kevin, you might want to comment on this \u2013 they've been asking for more on-demand, in current season. What's happened for example in the broadcast networks over the last year?", "Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.", "Well we've been conveying and having very good conversations with all the broadcast networks, and we've had an existing deal with Turner for a long time to convey full season stacking rights to those networks.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "For Turner, but then now you have some broadcast.", "Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.", "We're having conversations with the broadcast networks, and we have a couple of deals already in place for the upcoming broadcast season. We had a deal with FOX last year. And so I think that those \u2013 you're seeing, from Warner Bros. perspective, we've been conveying those rights, and we will continue to convey those rights.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So I hope that answers your question.", "Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will be coming from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions.", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you. Good morning. I have a couple more on Hulu. First, did your equity stake give you a strategic leadership role with respect to Hulu's plans going forward? What does the 10% give you there in terms of shaping the future of the product? And then second, with respect to the OTT product, and the relationship with Turner, should we expect that the agreement is similar to an MVPD arrangement and that a smaller distributor and that you'll be paid at the kind of the high end of the pricing range for the Turner networks with escalators that are consistent with other distributors? Or is there something different given your ownership stake? Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Why don't you do the affiliate situation first? Then I'll talk about the...", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Thanks, Mike. It's John. So with respect to the virtual MVPD component, you should think about the structure and the nature of our arrangement with Hulu being similar with the type of arrangements we have with the virtual MPVDs that we're already in business with, including Sling and Sony Vue. And we're not going to discuss pricing, obviously, but the structure is similar and we're quite pleased with the opportunity to participate in the product when it gets launched.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Now on the governance side, we don't have an active role, and coming in as a 10% investor without a board seat, we think it reduces complications around governance. Now we like the asset, and we like it even more if it has better budgets for programming and more resources for platform capabilities. And we think that's helpful.", "And as we said \u2013 Howard said it, I've said it \u2013 we're focused on making investments to capitalize on these opportunities and to help serve consumer demand. They want all kinds of VOD and interface capabilities, and they want more choice of bundles and price points. And we think that this helps it. It's part of a number of other services that, as you know, we either have ourselves, like HBO NOW or other ones overseas, or the partnerships we do with others or the affiliate deals, not just like the one John just described at Hulu but all the ones we've got with Sling and with Sony Vue and with Comcast and Verizon and AT&T and all the other distributors.", "So I think what you're seeing here is a resurgence of a kind of investment and health in the entire ecosystem that's going where consumers want, and I think it's going to be a great thing for the diversity of product production and the health of the industry.", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "John, if I could just follow up, are there significant differences between the virtual MVPD arrangements with Sling and Vue and sort of your traditional ones with cable, satellite or telco operators?", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "No.", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS. These proceed with your question.", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks so much. I just \u2013 one final Hulu question for John, and then a question for Jeff. John, will the Hulu-Turner deal include mobile rights and have a minimum guarantee similar to what we're hearing AT&T has but Sony Vue did not have?", "And then for Jeff, with the guidance range you clearly have a line of sight for 2016, and correct me if I'm wrong, but the year is coming in basically where you had hoped when you gave the $6 EPS guidance at the Analyst Day a couple years ago, just less $0.50 or so of currency headwinds.", "So my question is, when you look at the growth outlook for 2017 and 2018 relative to your original $8 EPS guide that you previously had out there, other than the currency headwind impact, which should be the same $0.50 or so carried forward, has anything else changed in your growth outlook when you think about the next couple years for the company? Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You start.", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Hey, Doug, it's John. Let me start. Look, listen, I hope you can appreciate we're not going to get into the details with respect to deal-by-deal in what's included and what's not included. I think just philosophically, though, and we've been very consistent on this point now for some time, having the single most concentrated portfolio of the highest value networks in the country, we would anticipate having carriage in many if not all of the new potential entrants that come into the ecosystem. At the same time, while we intend to fully support our existing partners who are incredibly important to us. So that \u2013 but with respect to which rights are in which deals, we're just not going to get into that level of detail.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And Doug, on your question about our general performance and earnings track, I love your question. You're right, you're premise is right. But we're not going to go \u2013 you know how this \u2013 and give formal long-term guidance right now. There's a lot of ins and outs that happen as we've been telling you as we go on year-to-year. But you're right to point out and ask, well, gee, you're on a very good track, very much familiar to those of you who have been following our predictions over the year. So we feel very good about it, and if you look at what we're saying today and our results this year and the raise we just did and some of the strategic moves that we are making and the advances where the industry is now finally to accelerate into a much stronger way of distributing the fantastic content that it already makes, we feel very good about the earnings track for many years.", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. I had to try. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.", "Operator, next question?", "Operator", "Yes, our next question is coming from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please proceed with the question.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Maybe I will stick with the Hulu theme here. Can you also speak to the potential to market or bundle HBO on any of the Hulu platforms as a way to further accelerate growth? And then, Howard, does the EPS guidance assume maybe somewhere like a mid-single digit EPS impact for the last five months of the year?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You start on that.", "Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.", "John, it's Richard. Obviously we're in conversations. I have nothing really to add at this time, but we're having constructive conversations and we expect they'll continue.", "Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey John, can you repeat your question?", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "I just wanted to confirm with the PPA and the cost at Hulu that it's a mid-single digit EPS impact for the last five months of the year.", "Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, that's right, John.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Great. And then maybe Kevin...", "Howard M. Averill - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "You know, $0.06 that I mentioned.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Kevin, I know you recently talked about the plan to reduce ad loads by about 50% on new TNT dramas, and I think there's no question that it improves the viewer experience, but as you add more shows, can you talk about your confidence level in your ability to have maybe at least a revenue-neutral outcome and to what extent that was part of the discussion and negotiation in the upfront?", "Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.", "I can answer for Kevin Reilly but this is Kevin Tsujihara. I think for Kevin Reilly it would be five more Warner shows. But I'm going to let John Martin take that one.", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Thanks, John. So just, that's a hard act to follow. So for everybody's benefit, we have announced that beginning in the fourth quarter, we're going to essentially reduce the ad loads on Tru TV in half. But I think what you're referring to is that for the new original shows that are going on to TNT and right now it's really just been Animal Kingdom, but we've made certain commitments to new originals that will be coming on later this year, we are going with those shows with more content and less advertising.", "And let me say that the early results are quite encouraging. And I would repeat that it's early. And we're going to be obviously paying close attention to this, but it's all being driven by the fact that we know that we have to have a network that has an experience that can compete with the very best consumer experiences in the world.", "So we've reduced the number of ads. We've been engaged with in discussions with our agencies, with our advertisers and what we've been seeing is smaller drop off during ad pods, meaning that we're retaining higher audience levels during advertising commercials, which means higher ratings to the network. We believe the early results indicate that there's even higher recall for the ads that are there.", "We're working very, very hard to make the ads more relevant with our native product and our own internal production capabilities to make sure that the advertising is more relevant and contextual with respect to the content itself, and that was very, very helpful during the upfront and extremely, extremely well-received, one of the reasons why we were able to garner double-digit CPM increases and we think we're leading the industry here.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.", "Next question?", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So you launched on Sling. I think you surprised a lot of people by being one of the early partners when Sling launched their single stream product and you've been a part of their multi stream product. And it's been call it more than 18 months now since Sling has been out. But Sling is still charging the same kind of $20 for their core service. I'm curious, are you getting annual increases that are \u2013 I know you're getting double-digits on your legacy MVPDs. Are you getting double-digit increases annually from Sling while they don't raise retail price? How does that work or how are you thinking about virtual MVPDs and the ability to get annual affiliate fee increases, especially with today's news vis-\u00e0-vis Hulu?", "And then just two, you made an announcement I think last week or the week before about Chuck Lorre from Warner Bros., and I'd love \u2013 you've been kind of hesitant before to sell multi-cam comedies, especially Chuck Lorre comedies to Netflix because those are the huge win opportunities that you've gotten on the syndication side, such as Big Bang. And I'm curious why this was the right deal to do to sell something like that and potentially limit your upside versus the massive syndication values you can get off of those type of comedies?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "John, you do.", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Thanks, Rich. It's John. I'll start. Listen, I think philosophically the way we're looking at the potential new entrants, the virtual MVPDs, the Slings, whatever you want to call them, is we're looking at them in the exact same way as we're looking at our traditional facilities-based partners. And we have a highly concentrated portfolio of very valuable networks that we intend to get full value for over time, and one of the reasons why we've been able to garner significant pricing increases is we've been starting from a lower base. But you should assume that the deals that we're striking with respect to everyone carries with it similar rate card assumptions and accelerants.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Kevin?", "Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.", "Hi, Rich. It's Kevin. As it relates to the Chuck Lorre show that we announced going to Netflix, that was really a matter of the subject matter really lent itself to SVOD. Being related to marijuana usage and a marijuana kind of background, it really didn't really lend itself to advertiser-friendly broadcast networks.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC", "Fair enough.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.", "Great. I think we're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Yes, the next question is coming from the line of Omar Sheikh with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Morning, everyone. Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First of all, for Jeff on Hulu again, I wonder if you could just clarify whether or not you will be licensing any of your content to Hulu's SVOD products. I think I read somewhere that you won't be, but some clarity on that would be useful. And then also, on the live streaming product, could you maybe give us a sense of what it might look like in terms of price points, content offering and sort of availability of stacking rights and so on? That would be very helpful.", "And then second question is just on for Richard maybe on HBO, I know Jeff said that now it had the strongest quarter yet. I wonder whether you could \u2013 I could tempt you into updating us on some numbers there. And then maybe if you could just let us know which international markets you are planning to launch that, the NOW product in, in the second half. Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Richard, why don't you?", "Richard L. Plepler - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Home Box Office, Inc.", "Sure. Omar, I'll start. Obviously, I can't get into numbers other than to say we've had substantial growth in the quarter. We see an enormous amount of momentum. We've lapped our marketing, and the data we're getting is improving all the time. Churn is going down all the time, and we couldn't be more pleased as more and more content suited to digital arrives. Jon Stewart is coming, Vice News is coming, Bill Simmons obviously very conducive to it. We like the momentum we're seeing and I think it's reflected in the progress and in the numbers.", "Internationally, early days in Latin America, as you know, with our launch so far in Colombia and in Mexico, and we've announced later in the year launches in Argentina, in Spain, in Brazil. We're very excited about the opportunity there. So again, this just reflects our ability to go multilaterally around the world, our networks business, OTT business, our licensing business, wherever we think we have the best long-term monetization, that's what we're going to pursue. Nordics is a case study in how fast we can improve momentum because the rate of growth in Nordics over the last year has just been tremendous OTT.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Omar, if I understood your question, I think it was whether as part of our investment in Hulu we had any individual or content licensing obligations or deals, and the answer is no. There's nothing in there specifically, any particular content license. And so, that's the SVOD service. Now that means that of course we are and we will continue to look at shows, or well and I guess you're asking about individual shows, where SVOD providers or traditional providers come and want to license, whether it's Hulu, Netflix, et cetera, and we will do that on a standalone arm's-length basis. If you go then, I think you asked this, to the MVPD, that we have an affiliation of our networks into the bundle service, but that one, we can't really outline what their strategy and business plan is yet. I think they will be responsible for that.", "Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. That make sense. So just as a follow-up maybe, Jeff, if you think about what you've said before about licensing content potentially direct-to-consumer for the Turner networks, or more broadly across the content that you control, how should we think about where Hulu fits into that? Is this now going to be central to your strategy or you're going to continue to look at other ways to monetize your content, perhaps direct?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't understand the \u2013 would you \u2013 so the Turner networks, which for example now are available in a number \u2013 but they're all, you can get them and the shows-on-demand on every traditional distributor. You can get them on every new virtual distributor of every single package size and price point. If you go to HBO, you can get that through on-demand fully through every distributor basically in the world of any kind, and increasingly, you can get it as a broadband delivered thing. So what is your question in relation to that?", "Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "So if you look at Hulu's service today, given your investment, do you see that as being central to your strategy for distributing content to consumers? Or when you're looking at the over-the-top strategy? Or do you see alternatives or other ways of distributing direct-to-consumer as well?", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we just spent the day here talking about how we think our networks, our brands and our shows should be available in essentially as many places and ways for consumers to get them with VOD, et cetera, as we can. And this is an additional way to do that. I don't -that's what we've been saying. So it adjoins all the other distribution methods and that's a good thing.", "Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Okay.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks", "Omar Sheikh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. That's clear. Thanks a lot.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.", "Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hello. Thanks. I have a Turner question and maybe one more after Hulu. On Turner, could you give us a little color on what you're doing in eSports, and how you think that business will grow over time? And actually, one more on Turner. You mentioned that there was a sub decline, but it wasn't specified. Can you say what it is?", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Sure, Jessica. It's John. On the sub decline, we're seeing continued subscriber declines in the US at a similar rate as we've experienced in the most recent quarter. So call it approaching about 2%. Some networks a little bit less, but no more really than, more than 2%. And all of the guidance that we've provided in terms of subscriber revenue growth continues to assume the continuous level of those types of declines. Although, as I've been saying, hopefully over time as these new virtual MVPDs get to the market with better, smaller packages of better networks we'll be offering consumers different bundles at better price points and could and should result in the stabilization of the subscriber overall levels.", "With regard to eSports, which we just concluded the championship of the tournament, we couldn't be more pleased and excited about how we hosted the first-ever eSports tournament on television. We call it ELEAGUE, and across the 10-week tournament between Twitch and TBS, there was almost approaching 1 billion minutes of consumption. It's brought millions of new viewers to the network. The age of the viewers of TBS are right down the strike zone of what we were hoping for: young viewers, heavily skewing male.", "We just announced an agreement with a new game, Overwatch. We're going to host that tournament beginning in the fall, and we've announced the second tournament with Counter-Strike, which will air after that. So we love the fact that we own this league in connection with WME and IMG. We think it's a huge area of secular growth. We absolutely intend to participate in a big way in this area, and we couldn't be more pleased with how the first season proceeded.", "Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And, John, just a follow-up, which is the Hulu question. It's really for you, and kind of what you said about growing with skinnier bundles. I heard what you said. You was very clear that, you said the affiliates fees structure would be comparable to other deals. Can you talk a little bit about the advertising? In some ways it may actually \u2013 it seems like it may be better because it's more targeted. Could you comment on that?", "John K. Martin - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.", "Exactly. I think you asked the question, but it was more of a statement that I'll validate. Everything that's happening at Hulu is moving in the same direction as to what we're doing on our traditional ad-supported cable networks, which is trying to improve the consumer experience with less overall advertising, but now we've got our Turner Data Cloud built out full capacity. We're going to have hundreds of, millions of records of data by the end of this year, and one of the reasons why, again, we were so successful in the upfront is we think we're leading the industry with products that can sell audiences rather than just demos and dayparts. So I think your statement is completely accurate.", "Jessica Jean Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey. Thanks. As you mentioned, you guys are having a pretty good year at Warner Bros. Disney's having a pretty good year as well, but I think most of the rest of your peers are having a very difficult year. Do you think there's been any change in audience behavior around the film industry? If so, how are you reacting to that? And do you think that the studio business in general is in need of consolidation to fix some of these problems? Thanks.", "Kevin Tsujihara - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.", "I think what we're seeing is that the big franchises mean more than ever. If you look at the top six films, they represent approximately 35% of the domestic box office. So when you think about what we laid out a couple of years ago as the strategy, we thought that the slate needed to be kind of anchored by the big franchises like Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the DC movies and the Lego movies, and we're executing on that.", "As it relates to whether we think that scale is required in that environment, I think that we're going to \u2013 we are one of the few scale players on the film side, but even more importantly, we're one of the studios, one of the couple of studios that have the big intellectual property that allows us to be able to anchor a slate like that. So if you think about consolidation the way we think about it, I don't think you would need to see consolidation from players that don't have intellectual property merging with other players that don't have intellectual property for scale, per se. What you really need are the big franchises that are going to be able to drive the economics which is what we're seeing and kind of what our strategy is based on.", "Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.", "So, Jeff, you might want to say a few words to wrap up.", "Jeffrey L. Bewkes - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. So just to wrap up, I hope you all feel the way we do. We're very pleased with our performance, we're encouraged by industry developments and we think the company is very well positioned to bring the best content to consumers in the way they want it. So that makes us excited about the future and we'd like to thank everybody for joining.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. This will conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Averill - Time Warner, Inc.", "John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.", "Richard L.

LLC", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "Operator", "Welcome to the Time Warner, Inc. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Call. My name is Rob and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jessica Holscott, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Holscott, you may now begin.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's fourth quarter and full year earnings call. First, we report in certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or those implied by these statements. Please see our 10-K and 10-Q for items that could affect future results or performance.", "I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's Chairman and CEO; who will be followed by Howard Averill, Time Warner's CFO; and after their prepared remarks, our divisional CEOs, John Martin, Richard Plepler and Kevin Tsujihara; and our General Counsel, Paul Cappuccio, will join us for our Q&A session.", "Jeff?", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Jessica, and thanks, everybody, for listening in this morning. We had an outstanding fourth quarter, topping off a very successful year in 2016. And for the year, our revenues increased 4% to $29.3 billion and adjusted operating income grew 10% to $7.6 billion with record results in each of our divisions.", "Adjusted EPS was up 23% to $5.86 per share. That's our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Now looking at the fourth quarter, revenues grew 11% to $7.9 billion, with increases in each of our divisions. And adjusted operating income increased 25% to $1.8 billion. We generated a record $4.4 billion in free cash flow and we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends over the course of the year.", "What's driving these results is the same combination of strong execution, continued investment in our businesses and disciplined capital allocation that's enabled us to provide superior long-term returns to our shareholders. Our strategy starts, as you all know, with investing in and creating the world's most compelling video content. We then ensure that it can be accessed and enjoyed by consumers wherever, whenever and on whatever device they want it, all around the world.", "And increasingly, that means working with both our distribution partners and on our own to ensure great experiences that connect consumers with our content and our brands. You can see the success of this strategy across each of our businesses last year.", "Let me share a few highlights and I'll start at the networks. In 2016, Turner made terrific progress on its goal of transforming its leading portfolio of entertainment, news, sports and kids brands, investing in each of its businesses to make them ever more powerful and engaging for audiences.", "For the year, among adults 18 to 49 in prime time, we held three of the top five slots among ad supported Cable Networks with TBS, TNT and Adult Swim. And, in fact, TBS was the number one entertainment network in prime for the fourth consecutive year, showcasing a great mix of fresh originals, sports and acquired content. Early last year, we began introducing a lineup of bold new comedies that includes Angie Tribeca, The Detour and Wrecked. We've also had a breakout success in Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, which during the summer began outpacing The Daily Show and continued to do so in the fourth quarter. We also added two new comedies in People of Earth and Search Party, which debuted to strong critical reviews. All of the freshman shows have been renewed.", "And if you haven't seen them, we've made the entire seasons available On Demand to binge view, as with all the latest Turner original series all On Demand.", "Well, if 2016 was TBS's year, we expect 2017 to belong to TNT. It's just underway in its refresh process, but it's already off to an encouraging start with newcomers: Animal Kingdom, produced by Warner Bros.; and Good Behavior, both of which have also been renewed. And this year, we're rolling out a slate that includes exciting new series like The Alienist, Will and Claws. Add in compelling franchise movies, which include those from DC Universe and the entire Star Wars library and recent Marvel movies, and you can see why we're very confident in TNT's future as the home for great drama.", "Another part of Turner's success, a critical part, and \u2013 well, basically a vital part, is our success in sports and our rights to the NCAA tournament, the NBA and Major League Baseball. Last year, we aired the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game for the first time ever, and we generated record revenues across our March Madness properties. This is such a strong relationship for us that we, along with CBS, renewed our deal with the NCAA through 2032.", "Our NBA package also continues to deliver tremendous results, and that was highlighted by game seven of last season's Western Conference Finals. It became the most-watched telecast ever in the history of TNT. We also launched our ELEAGUE gaming network in partnership with WME | IMG, and that's off to a promising start. And it's already bringing new younger viewers to TBS.", "Speaking of younger viewers, I have to mention Adult Swim again and its leading position with millennial audiences. In 2016, it was the number one network among 18 to 34 year olds for the 12th year in a row.", "Now, what a year for CNN, the number one news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time; let's just say that again: the number one news network among adults 18 to 49 in prime time, and the number one digital news destination in 2016. CNN capped off its most-watched year ever with a record-setting election night, ranked number one in prime that evening across all cable and broadcast networks.", "With the historic U.S. Presidential election behind us and the new administration in place, we have every confidence that CNN will continue to reinforce its reputation as not only the source the world turns to for trusted news coverage, but also as a destination for compelling original series and documentaries.", "And internationally, Turner launched a dozen new networks, while holding its position as the number one portfolio of pay-TV networks across Latin America.", "Whether it's content, advertising or distribution, Turner is making important progress evolving its business in ways that recognize the changing media habits and that put the consumer first.", "Last year, Turner continued to build on the successful 2015 launches of short form news site Great Big Story and digital studio Super Deluxe. And in November, Turner Classic Movies launched FilmStruck, a new over-the-top service for lovers of art house movies.", "And in distribution, Turner has demonstrated the value of its portfolio by being an anchor tenant on each of the new virtual MVPD services that have launched as well as on Hulu's upcoming new service.", "Now, let's move to the gold standard in premium video, Home Box Office. HBO had another great year, while making investments for an even stronger original programming lineup. Once again, 2016 brought more primetime Emmy awards to HBO than any other network, and that's for the 15th straight year. Game of Thrones' sixth season hit record viewership of 26 million people per episode. That's about a 50 rating on HBO \u2013 actually, more than that on a sub base. And we also had the biggest launch of a new series in HBO history with Westworld. It's produced by Warner Bros., and it surpassed even the Game of Thrones first season.", "I want to pause on that and say that even with the explosion of new outlets and choices in this golden age of video, HBO remains singular in its ability to attract artists who push the boundaries of what's creatively possible. And that's the case whether it's on an epic scale of a show like Westworld or on a human scale with a show like Girls, which begins its sixth and final season this weekend.", "You'll also see that in our upcoming limited series Big Little Lies, with a stellar cast including Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, which follows last year's acclaimed series, The Night Of.", "In 2016 at HBO, we also premiered the well-received freshman seasons of Insecure, Divorce, Vice Principals and High Maintenance, and those ran alongside returning comedy powerhouses Veep, Silicon Valley and Ballers. Of course, HBO offers much more than its original programming. It's got the best lineup of recent Hollywood films, hit films, available anywhere. And they account for a significant amount of HBOs viewership.", "When you add in great documentaries, sports and late-night powerhouses like Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, or Real Time with Bill Maher, both of which experienced record viewership last year, as well as our new nightly series, VICE News Tonight, you can see why HBO stands out from the pack and why we're very confident about the growth opportunities ahead.", "HBO has also been blazing the trail in conducting with consumers through its streaming product, which added distribution on Microsoft's Xbox, on Samsung's Smart TVs, Sony's PlayStation and Amazon Prime channels in 2016.", "In total, HBO recently surpassed 2 million domestic over-the-top subscribers, so we're really pleased with the progress. And HBO is just as focused on reaching consumers abroad, with over-the-top lunches in Spain, Brazil and Argentina in 2016.", "Finally, let's turn to Warner Bros., the global entertainment leader. Warner's had another record year with strong results in television and film and a growing consumer products business that ties into its focus on franchise properties.", "In movies, we reached nearly $5 billion in global box office. That's the second best year in our history, and it was driven across a range of hits led by our franchise releases Batman versus Superman, Suicide Squad, and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. But the depth and diversity of our slate was also on display with strong performances from movies like Central Intelligence, Lights Out, The Conjuring 2 and Sully.", "We are just as excited about 2017, with a lineup that starts with The LEGO Batman Movie, which opened, by the way, this weekend. And we also have the highly anticipated next installments in our DC slate with Wonder Woman in June and Justice League in November.", "In television, at Warner's, we were the number one supplier to broadcast networks again. This is now for the eighth year in a row, with at least four shows on each network this season. And that includes: the number one overall series on television, The Big Bang Theory; and the number one non-scripted series on television, The Voice; as well as newcomers like Lethal Weapon and Riverdale.", "We've mentioned before that our DC franchise has been one of our most important priorities at Warner's. And you can see the results, not just at the box office, but also: in the 10 DC-based shows we have on TV, in the $4.5 billion consumers spent on DC merchandise last year, contributing to our record performance in consumer products, and finally, in our hit videogame franchises, including Injustice 2, which will release this coming May.", "Similar to Turner and HBO, Warner Bros. also continues to make strides in developing direct-to-consumer capabilities to serve its fans in today's evolving environment. We created the Warner Bros. Digital Networks division and we closed deals to buy Machinima, giving us a platform to connect to coveted and hard-to-reach young gamers, and DramaFever, which gives us the capability to launch and operate new over-the-top broadband VOD services.", "Across our company, we had a very active and successful year. And we're inspired by the future of media that we're helping to shape. As we have said many times before, connecting more directly with consumers as our businesses evolve, both within and outside the existing ecosystem, is one of our most important strategic priorities. And we're making a lot of progress.", "We believe our deal to be acquired by AT&T, which we announced on October 22, will further enhance our ability to innovate and thrive. The special meeting of shareholders to vote on the transaction will be held a week from today. The regulatory review process is underway and we remain confident that the deal will be approved later this year.", "Once that happens, we're very excited about the potential of combining AT&T's great strength in mobile and video distribution and its fantastic customer relationships, with the world's greatest storyteller, and the value we can create together by accelerating the evolution of our company and our industries for the benefit of consumers.", "In the meantime, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to lead the industry, both creatively and financially, not just for 2017, but for many years to come. Thanks again for listening.", "And, with that, let me turn it over to Howard.", "Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on our website. Starting with consolidated results, we finished 2016 with a great fourth quarter. Revenues increased 11%. Adjusted operating income was up a very strong 25%, with growth across all divisions. And adjusted EPS grew 18%.", "We also had strong results for the full year, with revenue up 4%, adjusted operating income up 10% and each of our divisions posted record profits, leading to our eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Margins expanded over 100 basis points for the year, even as we increased our investment in content and marketing across the company to over $15 billion. And we continue to remain focused on tightly managing overhead costs and operating efficiently to help fund these investments.", "Adjusted EPS increased 23% to $5.86 for the year, which included a $0.29 net tax benefit related to a tax accounting method change that we recognized in the third quarter. Excluding the tax benefit, adjusted EPS would have increased a robust 17% to $5.57, led by our strong operating performance as well as a lower share count.", "In 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion of our stock prior to discontinuing share repurchases in October as a result of the pending merger with AT&T. And combined with our dividend, we returned close to $3.6 billion to shareholders during the year. So we delivered strong financial results in 2016, while continuing to make investments across our businesses to sustain attractive growth over the long-term. And we expect to carry that momentum into 2017.", "Looking ahead, in order to better reflect our operating performance and given the volatility in certain below-the-line items that impact our adjusted EPS, we are providing 2017 guidance for adjusted operating income, which we expect will grow in the high single-digits based on current exchange rates. I'll provide more context on the key drivers across our businesses throughout my presentation.", "Now, turning to the segments, I'll start at Turner, where we closed out a record year with another quarter of strong profit growth, as we continue to benefit from our domestic affiliate renewals. Subscription revenues increased 14% in the fourth quarter and were up 12% for the year, including 150 basis point FX headwind.", "Domestic subscription revenues grew 15% in the quarter and we finished 2016 up over 14%, on the higher end of what we expected coming into the year. So we're really pleased with the outcome of our affiliate renewals, and we remain confident in our outlook for solid double-digit domestic subscription revenue growth in 2017. International subscription revenue was up in the high single digits in the quarter, and that included a 300 basis point drag from FX.", "Advertising revenue was down 2% in the fourth quarter. That was a bit below our expectations because of a slowdown in certain international regions. As a result, international advertising declined mid-single digits, excluding about a 350 basis point drag from FX. However, we still believe secular trends internationally remain strong.", "Domestically, we face a 300 basis point headwind from the comparison to last year's record Major League Baseball post-season performance. Even so, advertising was flat in the quarter. That capped off a strong year for domestic advertising, which increased mid-single digits. The growth was led by the record performance at our news business, as it benefited from the presidential election coverage as well as healthy demand for premium sports properties.", "Looking at the first quarter, we expect total advertising revenue to be flat to up low single digits. The scatter market remains healthy, with pricing up double digits versus the upfront at our domestic entertainment network. And we expect our sports and news businesses to be the key drivers and international trends to improve.", "Moving on, Turner's strong revenue trends resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 9% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year, and we achieved that while continuing to make significant investments at programming, marketing and new digital initiatives. Programming expenses were flat in the fourth quarter and up low single digits, excluding programming charges from both periods. For the full year, programming was up 5%, primarily related to higher sports costs and CNN's election coverage.", "Marketing costs increased around 20% both for the quarter and the year, as we invested in the rebrands at TNT and TBS, including support for our new original series. Overall, Turner delivered great financial results in 2016 and has a lot of operating momentum. And with the strength of our brands and the investments we're making across the business, we believe we're very well-positioned to continue delivering attractive growth for the long-term.", "Turning now to HBO, where our investments in high quality programming contributed to double-digit profit growth in the fourth quarter and out-positioned HBO to capitalize on the big global opportunity for subscription services. Domestic subscription revenue was up in the mid-single digits for the quarter and the year. Similar to recent quarters, we continue to see subscriber headwinds at our traditional affiliates, especially those involved in M&A integration. As a result, despite very strong growth in digital subscribers, total domestic subs across HBO and Cinemax were essentially flat for the year.", "Looking forward, we believe HBO has a big untapped subscriber opportunity in the U.S. And capitalizing on that is our most important long-term growth driver. So on the deals we've recently signed, we're emphasizing subscriber growth. That means as our partners grow HBO subs, it will benefit our subscription revenue growth. And while it takes time to implement new deals, we're very encouraged with the initial progress on the deals we've closed. However, finishing this affiliate cycle has taken longer than anticipated, and we're still in the midst of renewing some deals. So we do not expect sequential improvement in subscription revenue growth in the first quarter. But we do anticipate that sub revenue trends will improve as the year progresses, especially in the second half of 2017 as we complete affiliate negotiations and continue to expand our digital distribution.", "We've seen a nice pickup in OTT sub growth recently. And our goal is to add more digital partners later this year. Along with a return to Subscription growth in our traditional business, that should contribute to a solid increase in total subs for the year. And taking all these factors into account, we anticipate high single-digit growth in Subscription revenue for the year.", "Moving on, Content and other revenues were up 7% for the quarter, mainly due to higher home video revenue. For the year, Content and other revenues grew 2%, primarily reflecting healthy growth in international licensing as demand for HBO's original content remains robust. Across HBO's international networks, including unconsolidated JVs, revenues were up double digits for the year, excluding FX, and that's a result of strong trends in the Nordics and LatAm.", "Adjusted operating income was up 10% for the quarter and 3% for the year. Programming expenses declined 2% in the fourth quarter, given the comparison to last year's programming charges. Excluding the charges from both periods and the benefit from reduced amortization this year, programming costs were up double digits in the quarter and the year.", "That's a result of our continued investments in original programming, including new series like Westworld, Divorce, The Night Of and Insecure. So we continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives in 2016 and we have a lot of momentum on the content side. With global demand for HBO's distinctive premium content only growing and Subscription revenue trends improving, we're confident HBO can deliver healthy growth for years to come.", "Now looking at Warner Bros., where our theatrical business continues to perform exceptionally well, thanks to our franchise-led film slate. And that resulted in significant profit growth, including record adjusted operating income for both the quarter and the year. Coming into the year, we planned for theatrical to be the primary driver at Warner's and that's exactly what played out. Our two DC movies and first Fantastic Beasts installment led a very strong, diverse slate that drove high single-digit growth in theatrical revenues in 2016. And we more than doubled theatrical profits, making this our most profitable film slate in close to a decade.", "The success of the film slate is also contributing to healthy growth in our consumer products business, where revenue increased close to 40% last year. So we're already benefiting from the new strategy we put in place and think we have a big opportunity to keep growing our consumer products business over the next few years.", "In TV, we had difficult comparisons on the licensing side, but total revenues were up in the quarter and for the year, mainly due to double-digit growth in initial telecast revenue. That's a result of increased production, reflecting Warner's continued expansion at the cable, premium and SVOD production. Additionally, we continue to benefit from strong international licensing demand for Warner's TV content.", "As we discussed, we also had difficult comparison from games after record results in 2015 and no franchise console releases last year. So as expected, revenues declined significantly. Looking to 2017, we have a strong lineup, anchored by two franchise console releases and several mobile games, so we're set up for a great year in games.", "Across theatrical and TV, home entertainment revenues were down double digits for the year, primarily due to fewer releases and a softer home video release schedule, but revenue did grow starting in the second half of 2016 as our franchise titles started to move into the home entertainment window. We also remain encouraged by EST which was up double digits for the year. And digital now represents about half of our home entertainment profits, so we're encouraged as we head into 2017, when we expect to grow both home entertainment revenue and profit.", "Overall, Warner Bros. had another terrific year, thanks to great execution of its strategy focused on monetizing key global franchises across all its businesses. And with a tremendous multi-year film slate, healthy trends in the TV business and upcoming franchise games releases, Warner is positioned to deliver strong growth in adjusted operating income in 2017 and beyond.", "Turning to the next slide, we also had a great year for free cash flow, which increased 22% to a record $4.4 billion. So we converted 94% of our earnings into cash, continuing our strong track record of conversion.", "We benefited from a strong growth in adjusted operating income as well as lower cash taxes related to the tax accounting change I mentioned earlier. Looking to 2017, while we certainly have difficult comparisons, especially on cash taxes, we expect strong conversion and another year of healthy free cash flow.", "Moving on to our balance sheet, we ended 2016 with $22.8 billion of net debt. That's up from 2015, mainly due to our share repurchases and dividends. It also reflects about $1 billion in debt redemption premiums and costs associated with our tender offers in December. We expect about $800 million on M&A for the year, largely related to the investment in Hulu we made in August. So we ended the year right around our leverage target of 2.75 times. And with share repurchases discontinued, we continue to expect our net leverage ratio to decline as we progress through 2017.", "So on the whole, we had a great year in 2016, and we believe we're set up for a strong 2017. And I'll touch on some of the key items for the year ahead. Starting at Turner, we anticipate solid double-digit domestic subscription revenue growth as we continue to benefit from our affiliate renewals. At the same time, as we planned for, we expect programming costs to grow in the double digits, primarily due to new MBA, deal which will account for approximately $400 million of incremental costs in the first half of 2017.", "And similar to the past few years, Turner remains focused on constraining overhead costs to help fund these investments in great content and new growth opportunities. So that should add up to another year of healthy revenue trends and solid profit growth at Turner.", "At HBO, as I mentioned, we expect Subscription revenue growth to be in the high-single digits in 2017. That growth should step up through the year as we complete additional affiliate deals, continue to make progress implementing our new deals and expand digital distribution. The improvement in Subscription revenue trends should translate to attractive adjusted operating income growth in 2017.", "At Warner's, we're also poised for healthy growth in adjusted operating income, led by our theatrical and videogame businesses. Our franchise slate continues in 2017 with two more DC films as well as The LEGO Batman Movie. And we expect other businesses like home entertainment, consumer products and TV licensing will benefit from the strong film slate and recent theatrical success. I already mentioned our strong games slate this year. We also continue to see healthy demand in our TV business and expect another year of solid results as we further expand production.", "So we're positioned to deliver attractive financial results at all of our businesses, and that's reflected in our expectation for 2017 adjusted operating income growth to be in the high single digits. Given the NBA deal cost in the first half, the timing of improvement in HBO sub revenue trends and the cadence of the film and games slate at Warner Bros., at this point, we anticipate that growth will be heavily weighted to the second half of the year.", "Overall, we're very pleased about how we're executing across the company and the progress we're making on key initiatives. And we expect to deliver healthy growth in 2017, even as we continue to make important investments in high-quality video content and new business models that should position us to sustain attractive growth trends well into the future.", "With that, let me turn it back to Jessica to start the Q&A.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Great, thanks, Howard. Rob, do you want to open up the queue and take the first question, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you. Jeff, understanding many of the virtual MVPDs haven't launched yet, based on what you're seeing or expecting, can you update us on your view to what extent you think they'll be incremental to the ecosystem? And do you think that'll be clear by the end of this year or is that more of a multi-year story in terms of playing out?", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "And I'll start and go to John. Look, there's a lot of them that have different price points, as we all know. There is also a fair degree of variation in the reach of some of these virtual MVPDs in terms of their sub bases and platform. So, all that's a very healthy development as we've been predicting. You have new entrants coming in all the time; Amazon, Hulu, et cetera.", "Given the range of all of these things, I think, it's safe to say that what they're going to help do is invigorate consumer interest everywhere in watching networks on demand, watching them on-the-go in mobile devices, and a whole range of offerings, which is what I think we'd all like to see. And what that's doing is fueling production \u2013 increases in production spending across the network industry. So, terrific and, of course, Warner's, as the biggest supplier to all networks, is part of that.", "I think it's too early to say, if you're asking for timing, what the relative size of the virtual MVPD sub growth is, let's say, in 2017 versus what the continued slope of the at-home ecosystem sub count turns out to be. So I don't have a specific answer for that. And, John, let me turn it to you, put the pressure on you if you have one.", "John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.", "Yeah. No, look, I don't have a lot to add to that. But I would say that our outlook doesn't assume a material benefit this year from virtual MVPD. So that's important when you think about the guidance we've given for Subscription revenues. But certainly, there's an opportunity for that. Between DIRECTV NOW, Sling and Sony, each of them have really started to gain traction very recently, proving that there is consumer demand for smaller video packages with top networks at lower prices.", "I think if you aggregate the number of subscribers for the three, we're approaching 2 million now in the United States. And if new OTT offerings can combine attractive pricing and packaging with great on-demand content, better interfaces and easier navigation, we think that we can attract new subs into the ecosystem. And, importantly, we think a lot of these subs are not cannibalizing existing subscribers. So that's a great opportunity for Turner to take share, since we're in all the major virtual MVPDs that have launched to-date. And we expect to be in those packages with wide consumer appeal.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Maybe, Howard, quickly, you talked about the affiliate fee growth in the U.S. coming in at the top end of the expectation for the year. Can you talk about the drivers of that? Did the sub declines come in better for the year or was there some sort of positive mix to highlight?", "Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.", "I think sub declines have been what we've expected. I mean, we've always talked about the fact that in any given quarter, you can see some minor adjustments and that's why we have focused overall on the full year. But there's nothing in particular that's driving that, John.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, there were some minor adjustments that went our way, effectively. Yeah.", "Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, John. We're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thank you. Good morning. Two topics, first on HBO, the 2 million domestic over-the-top subs is an impressive number. But to your point, it doesn't seem to be additive yet and you're focused on the subscriber growth next year. Can you talk in a little more detail about how in your renegotiations you're able to move to that subscriber growth that you're anticipating? Anything to help us on the mechanics there would be great. And then, second, you have made some big investments in basketball. We've seen weakness in ratings at football over the past year and that's caused some concern about these sports rights. Could you just tell us what you're seeing in basketball and why you feel optimistic about the value of those contracts? Thanks.", "Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.", "Mike, hi. It's Richard. Thank you for your question. The deals that we completed already, I think, are very indicative of why we're so encouraged and why we're looking optimistically and confidently to sub revenue acceleration second half of the year. Look, the blended penetration on the two deals that we completed is less than 50% of what the acquired company's penetration is. And we built incentives into those deals to drive that blended penetration up not only to where the acquired companies are, which are in the high 30%s, low 40%s, but beyond that.", "So as we look forward with those partners, the nature of the packaging, the nature of the marketing makes us very comfortable that we're going to see that sub acceleration, number one. Number two, in the deals, couple of deals that we have remaining, I think they, too, are going to see the opportunity before them to grow penetration beyond where they are now. And in some of our higher performing affiliates, I think, there's an opportunity to go even further.", "So we like the deals that we've completed. We'll finish the rest of our deals in the coming months. And I would say about our OTT business, it's very, very dynamic. It's actually 3X of the number that we reported at the end of 2015. And I think that shows not only the robust demand for HBO, but the opportunity we have out there not only in the traditional ecosystem but outside of it. So we're looking very confidently to this year. These deals take time. The integration takes time. In one of our major deals, they're just beginning to put us into the packaging that we've codified into the deal at the end of this month. And so, that's really what the lag is, but it will kick in in the second half of the year.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "And, John, do basketball.", "John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.", "Yeah. So, Mike, listen, I feel really confident in the sports that we're in. And if you look across the industry, ratings, in general, have improved recently, as we've moved past the election. We've seen better match-ups and more competitive games. So I think that indicates that the declines that were occurring back in the summer and the early fall are not really necessarily indicative of secular trends. And we're seeing very strong advertiser demand for both the NBA and the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship.", "So we continue to feel really good about our premium sports properties, but just to amplify one more thing, you can't forget about the importance of match-ups in competitive games. And when we look at the season, whether it's Cleveland versus Golden State or Oklahoma versus the Clippers or the Lakers versus Portland, those games all performed extremely well, with us growing year-over-year. So I think we're going to continue to hope for competitive games, but we love the advertiser demand and we are optimistic that we're going to be able to continue to grow our ratings for these properties.", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "We're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "And next question is from the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Vasily, are you there?", "Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC", "I'm here. Sorry. My question is for Kevin. Kevin, you had a fantastic couple of years at Warner Bros. But if one was to look forward, you're already the number one supplier in TV. The international box office, which fueled growth for many in the past decade, is not growing anymore as fast. Games come and go. What gives you confidence that you can continue to deliver growth from this very high base at this point? Can you just give us an idea what the drivers are maybe a little longer-term than 2017, what Howard outlined? Thank you very much.", "Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.", "Great. Thank you for the question. I think that, as Howard mentioned both for 2017 and beyond, we still believe that there's growth in the theatrical business. Our franchise strategy is off to a great start. We think we're going to continue that in 2017. Then, when we look at what we have in 2018 and 2019, and we feel very good about it. We also feel that we could still grow on television. And while the growth won't occur primarily in broadcast, where we've been number one for a long time, we do feel that there are opportunities in premium, in pay and in cable. And I feel really good about the fact that we did Westworld with HBO and Richard this year and Animal Kingdom with John. And we had some really big hits for Netflix with Fuller House and Gilmore Girls as well. So that is a business that we think that we can grow, and continue to grow.", "Games, again, it's a business while it's lumpy, we feel like we can create more sustainable pipeline as we get more to scale there on the console side. We have two big console games this year. And it's our goal to be able to put out a more consistent path with those games, but also grow mobile, which doesn't have that lumpiness.", "So if you look at those three big drivers on the content side, that creates opportunities for consumer products. And geography-wise, we think that there's big opportunity in China. We continue to develop a SVOD service. It's doing very well with our partner, Tencent. And we also believe that our partnership to create local language content, as well as export content into China is going create a big a growth opportunity for the company in the coming years. So we think that we feel good about 2017 and, more importantly, we feel about the growth trajectory going forward", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Vasily, this is Jeff. I just want to thank you for asking a question to Kevin, flew all the way here from L.A. It's 5:00 in the morning for him, and for pointing out that Warner's doing so well. Thank you.", "Vasily Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC", "My pleasure. Thank you.", "Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.", "I'll send you the studio tour tickets later.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Operator, the next question.", "Operator", "Oh, Yes. The next question is from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.", "Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. It's actually Ryan Fiftal on for Ben. So if there are any tickets left, I'll ask one for Kevin, and then I have one for Richard as well, if I may. So, Kevin, on your early VOD, can you give us any update on progress you're making constructing a new window there? And then, maybe on, I guess, on your list of strategic priorities, how high does premium VOD rank as something you think can move the needle for Warner's?", "Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.", "I was talking to Jeff about this yesterday. I think that we're making a lot of progress, because part of the reason that's driving us is consumers, and the economics of the film business. Because I think what you're seeing is, we talk a lot about these franchises, but the middle of the market in the theatrical business has gotten extremely tough. And we do think that having products like this, that are giving movies to consumers who want them earlier in the home, is a big opportunity. So we've been aggressively working with exhibitors to talk about models that will grow the market versus cannibalize the market.", "And we think that we're making a lot of progress on that end, because, ultimately, it's not really about business model per se, but it's really about giving consumers what they want, because if we don't give it to them, they're going to go to the pirated version.", "So this is very high on our list, and I think that it has the potential to change some of the economics of some of the films, the adult dramas that we're having problems with right now on the theatrical side, which is really important for a company like ours that creates a real broad slate every year.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "What was your second question? I didn't catch it", "Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Oh, no. I haven't asked it. So thank you, Kevin. And, Richard, it sounds like your HBO's OTT business has accelerated quite a bit. So can you give any sense of how important distribution through Amazon has been to that growth? I think it's only been a few months, if I'm right there, that you've been on that platform. But any color on the early results and performance there would be helpful. Thank you.", "Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.", "Sure. We're thrilled with it. It's accelerated very quickly. And I think it shows what we've said all along, which is the more opportunities we have to distribute HBO through a multitude of different distribution services and give our consumer the option to get it however and wherever they want, the better it is for our brand. So they've been a terrific new partner. There will be other digital partners that you will see announced in the coming weeks and months. And that's why we're so optimistic not only about our traditional business, but about our OTT business as well", "Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "We're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Yes. The next question is coming from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you. Two questions, please, first on Warner Bros., Kevin, given the rapid demand that we've seen in original content or demand for TV series, there's clearly been, obviously, a big benefit for Warner Bros., but sort of digging in to that a bit further, beyond just having higher demand, we're hearing that the terms have become much more favorable to the producers of these TV series, in terms of guaranteed pickup of an entire series or better pricing and such. Is that a real notable change in the sense are you seeing, I mean, is it more like just chatter about it or you're actually seeing real benefits from that sort of shift in leverage to the studio side?", "Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.", "I think there's a shift in leverage in the high-quality shows that really break out and the bifurcation that we're seeing on the theatrical side, where a disproportionate share of the revenue's going to the bigger movies. These big franchise movies are taking a bigger and bigger share. The big television shows, like Westworld, that break out are more valuable than ever, because there's more original content out there, but there's less things as a result because there's more competitions for things that really break out. And so when you have those and you have AAA talent who typically garner that kind of attention, I think it is more valuable and there is a little bit more leverage on that side.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then, just a quick question on Turner, if I can, I think you guys have previously said, if I remember correctly, that CNN should have record profitability in 2017. And I guess with such the news frenzy that has sustained, which is obviously good news for viewership, given the new administration and all the chaos there, can costs really come down, I guess, significantly this year? Just any color on that would be great.", "John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.", "Well, CNN had started the year with a continuing amount of significant momentum that it took outside of last year. As Jeff said, it's the most-watched year ever in the history of CNN. It was closer to Fox News than it's been in eight years and had the greatest advantage over MSNBC since 2009. And the strategy this year, we fully expect that linear ratings for the entire year are not going to be able to stay at last year's record levels, so we could have some difficult advertising comps, but CNN still has great momentum thanks to its strategy, which is multi-pronged. It's going all-in on covering big stories. It's adding originals. There'll be more hours of originals this year than in the past, which brings younger viewers to the network and usually garners big audiences. And it's investing in digital, which we expect is going to keep growing. It's been growing at revenue double digits.", "Digital now represents 25% of all CNN's overall ad revenue and last year, had its best year ever overtaking Yahoo! News. So I think CNN is positioned for another record year of profit growth in 2017. We're highly confident that we're going to be able to achieve that. And that's going to be led by a healthy increase in affiliate revenues and absolutely lower election expenses.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Thanks, Alexia. We're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Yes. Our next question is from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you. Jeff, just one question on BAMTech, recently, you guys decided to walk away from BAMTech and focus on a JV with NBC. Given the focus on digital distribution, just want to understand the thought process behind that. And, Howard, just one question on amort on HBO, I think this quarter again some of the programming amortization lifetime was changed. I think this was the second quarter over the last year, just wanted to understand the thought process behind that. Thanks.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "All right. Do you want to do...?", "Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.", "It's Richard. Let me answer your BAMTech question. First of all, our deal with BAM goes through the end of this year, so we're still working very closely with them. We obviously partnered with them to help launch HBO NOW, but, at the same time, we were parallel processing building our own tech stack, which I will remind you was in place and enabled us to launch HBO GO. So we've always had it in mind that we would create the ability to blend the tech stacks for GO and NOW, build one global platform and have our own capacity to launch streaming services all over the world. That's what we've done. They've been absolutely an enhanced part of our strategy. And we will continue to work with them, I expect, over the years, but we also are going to move forward doing it on our own.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Let me just add \u2013 this as Jeff \u2013 before Howard can get to amort. John, you've got iStreamPlanet.", "John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.", "Yes.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Kevin, you've got FilmStruck. We have platforms like that across the company and AT&T has it also. So bear that in mind as you think about essentially the building capabilities across the company to deliver direct-to-consumer variety of products, SVOD platforms and other kinds of direct consumer platforms.", "John K. Martin - Time Warner, Inc.", "And right now a lot of the technology stacks that you were just referring to have complementary capabilities. Some are better with live streaming. Some are better with VOD. Some have customer care capabilities. And the goal would be for us to work more collaboratively over time to rationalize the overall technology footprint. And, as you said, really excited to see how AT&T can help super-charge that.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Kevin, do you want to add?", "Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.", "No, I think that we're looking at a number of things between Turner and Warner Bros. where we're doing exactly that because -", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "The kids -", "Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.", "We haven't announced. But they're things that we're doing to take advantage, exactly what you said, that there's certain things that we all do that are slightly different. And the key thing is just taking the best of the best.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Yes.", "Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.", "Do you want to do the amort?", "Howard M. Averill - Time Warner, Inc.", "On the amortization, so back in the second quarter, we did make a change in our amortization, which really was a reflection of how our programming is being used, particularly with a lot of On Demand and HBO GO. The programming is \u2013 it does have a longer life. And so we did make an adjustment. But just to be clear, it's still significantly accelerated, as it was before, where the vast majority of the costs are incurred upfront. But we did have a benefit. Most of the benefit, by the way, came in the second quarter when we made the change. We did have about $20 million of benefit in the fourth quarter. And as we look ahead to next year, we don't see any net benefit from that as we look ahead to 2017.", "Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right. Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. We're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.", "Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good morning. Wanted to ask a couple questions on HBO. I guess, first, how are you thinking about using the incremental margin that will be generated by the acceleration in affiliate growth? Are you thinking of reinvesting it to expand into content slate, marketing, to drive more sub growth or will we see some of that flow to the bottom line and expand margins? And then, also just wanted to ask if you could comment just on the behavior that you've seen in terms of churn. Obviously around big content releases like Game of Thrones or Westworld, you're going to see higher gross adds. And just curious if you can comment on what you've seen after people have consumed those series, whether they stick around. Thanks.", "Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.", "Sure. Thank you. Yeah. Let me do the second first. On churn, particularly over the last few months, we've seen the lowest churn in \u2013 really, since the beginning of introducing HBO NOW and our OTT product. That, I think, is a result of two things. Number one, as our subscriber base ages, there's, of course, less churn. Number two, I think it speaks to the quality of the content and the range of the content. I think it's important to remember when you look at the usage on digital platforms and On Demand you see the usage going across a wide range of categories. It's not just Westworld and Game of Thrones and The Night Of. It's comedies. It's late night. It's documentaries. It's sports programming. It's important to punctuate that the usage of HBO programming is across a wide range of genres. And we're in the business, of course, of curating great content. So we're very encouraged by what we've seen on churn.", "Your question about investment, yes, we're going to take those margins and we are going to invest a lot of it in what we do for a living, which is trying to make the best content and curate the best content across a lot of different genres of our programming. And the exciting thing is the amount of talent that continues to come to the door with new projects, literally on a weekly basis, gives us no shortage; in fact, gives us an embarrassment of riches to choose from. And we're very excited about the announcement that you'll see in the coming weeks for 2018. And the investment that we're going to make robustly in programming speaks to, I think, the best of the brand.", "Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, Richard.", "Richard L. Plepler - Time Warner, Inc.", "All right.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Rob, I think, we have time for just one more question now.", "Operator", "Yes. That question will be coming from the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "Snuck in. I wanted to throw my hat in the ring for tickets as well. So, Kevin, is there a meaningful incremental revenue opportunity for in-season stacking rights, or has that been captured already? And since it's a new year, any evolution that we should expect in SVOD licensing strategy, especially since Time Warner, obviously, last year joined Hulu as a minority shareholder? And for Jeff, there's been a lot of discussion on over-the-top and direct-to-consumer on this call and others in media.", "I was curious. Do you look at the TV network business as ultimately continuing to be a regional business or developing into a global network business? And the reason I ask is there's an argument that TV networks are going global and direct-to-consumer and that those economics will be superior and more sustainable. And Netflix and Amazon are there. Fox is headed there quickly. You've got CNN globally, but many of your other networks are regional. So I'm just curious. How do you see the marketplace evolving and what it might mean, if anything, for Time Warner in that regard? Thanks.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "For the product sales side -", "Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.", "Well, on the stacking rights, I think, that we're confident that we're going to be able to reach stacking rights agreements with everyone. And all the networks that we do business with will have the capability to be able to offer a range of product with stacking rights, because we think it's great for the consumer. And you're looking at what the viewing trends are and they need to be able to do that.", "As it relates to any change in the way that we kind of view SVOD and our licensing strategy, I think, that we continue to look at it on a product-by-product basis and we continue to evaluate it. And we're going to continue doing that. But the marketplace is evolving, both domestically and internationally. And I think that you're going to continue to see everyone look at and evaluate each piece of content going forward.", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "And, Kevin, just to be clear, is the new season stacking rights pulling forward syndication revenue or do you think it's a net increase in the monetization of your TV products?", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Net increase.", "Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.", "Yes. It's a net increase of the license fee, the existing license fee, for that run. It's not seen as a syndication piece.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Well, you can do it both ways.", "Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.", "You could, but primarily driven that way.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "So I think you're asking about national networks and SVOD services, say, across the United States versus global across 7 billion people. Is that what you're asking?", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah. I was asking if you think the world is headed that way and if it has any implications for Time Warner.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "Okay. Well, yeah, the world is heading, as we all know, towards more global access by people to either a given show or a given network, and as you see the development of that \u2013 I know you were referencing some brands that started in the tech world. If you think of something like either CNN or HBO and then you can expand that out to other networks, things like CNN and HBO are global brands. They've got global distribution now.", "What we've been doing over the years is we've essentially tried to capitalize on these SVOD and linear network opportunities going global in terms of territory and going digital in terms of VOD across platforms, so not just TV but mobile devices. The bulk of people in an India or Brazil are watching differently on different device set-ups than, say, those in Western Europe or the United States.", "So we've been pursuing essentially that strategy of distribution for our networks that optimizes the reach of whatever distribution is in place. So there's a combination. HBO is an easy way to describe it because it started VOD and it started more global distribution, as did CNN, so we've got places where HBO is over-the-top direct as a network. We just launched a few in Western Europe, Spain. We are launching in Latin America. We have things in Eastern Europe like that.", "We also have HBO in Western Europe licensed into other SVOD like Sky and other sorts of platforms if they have superior reach and can therefore get our programming, which is usually branded as HBO Neighborhood Programming, and it then creates a choice as time goes on of whether we decide to move to direct network full schedule or whether we continue to license to optimize the value of the network name and the programming associated with it.", "You've got examples of Turner doing that at FilmStruck. You've got examples of Warner's doing it in China with \u2013 what are we, the second largest SVOD service in China?", "Kevin Tsujihara - Time Warner, Inc.", "Yes.", "Jeff L. Bewkes - Time Warner, Inc.", "And HBO was right alongside of that, licensed into that service.", "So, yes, of course, everybody that has programming and that can support a network will try to create optimal reach either for the shows or the network, and to the extent you can fill it out to a full network, that's a valuable asset. And we're moving in that direction where we can. And we're moving to supply those networks that have the reach, and can collect the money for us, where those conditions don't apply.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Jeff.", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. That was very helpful. Thank you.", "Jessica L. Holscott - Time Warner, Inc.", "So thank you, everyone, for joining. That just concludes the earnings call. So thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.
